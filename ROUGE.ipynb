When it works, motion detection is quite sensitive, and we receive quick notifications. I'll say it's excellent in picking up voice and audio! I have mine on the windowsill facing out, so perhaps the netting over the window contributes to the problem. It also does not always turn off for motion detection. We wanted to use it as a baby monitor, but it makes an unpleasant clicking sound every time you toggle the live view on and off. Even in night vision mode, the camera outperforms the more costly cameras I've had. This little camera is powerful, with superb image and coverage; I installed it in my garage and can see both the rear and front entrances going into my inside door. The sound is also very good and clear. However, the black and white at night is perfectly capable of detecting shadow individuals wandering about your belongings. This small camera was a breeze to set up. I appreciate that you may disarm it from your phone at any time. I already have cameras outdoors and have this one installed in my kitchen. It connects to the time I've previously set up, and the visual and sound quality are superb. This is an excellent system. Overall, it's worth it for me because I can now check on my printer without having to travel home. My room is visible in the photo. For the price, the camera is an excellent purchase. I work from home but need to be quiet, so this is how I keep an eye on my kids while they are in the living room without me. These are of high quality, however, you can't keep an eye on the camera all the time. It truly is a little camera with enormous quality. The ring is a superior, simpler, and more effective approach.\"]"

I've been able to watch live feeds in a multipane style for years and pick which camera I want to zoom in on, but not with this program. Second, technical help is, at best, mediocre. After many minutes on the phone, I was told that they needed me to reset the camera again due to my internet connection. It's small and wired, so I keep it in the entertainment center to avoid having to deal with the cord. I purchased this and used it for one month before discontinuing use. Another huge problem for me is that there are no choices for permanently zooming in on the camera. There is a way to store the video snippets on your phone, and now that I know how, that is what I do. Overall, the disadvantage is all my fault, not that of the software. I'm not very impressed after a few days. The good blink provides a free day trial after activating your camera, which is plenty of time to utilize and figure out the camera's functions. I cautioned her that she should return it, but it is such a minor inconvenience. My camera captured a person approaching my house to ring the doorbell, but I wasn't home. I didn't read up on one issue before purchasing this: you receive a day free trial for the video in the cloud storage, after which it will no longer record video. Logging in to access the feed does not always operate properly or at all. They lack the voice sound that I enjoyed on the blink. I'll be seeking another camera brand. And, guess what? It's catching motion left and right, but I can't see it since I'm not paying for the service. I've had a blink setup for about a year and the system is only somewhat satisfactory. The camera is not locked because I can get a live view. So it now just tells me there was movement, but I can't see what it was because it doesn't store past motions. Your android phone does not enable live viewing of the blink mini. It is only a few feet away from the router and cannot pick up the wifi signal. I read about the camera and reviews, but I never saw that you need to purchase a plan to record anything.\"]"

It's similar to having a blind spot. I'm grateful I still have my initial security camera system to help me through these difficult times. I enjoy Blinks' other goods, so I was hoping this would work. One of the cameras requires a battery replacement every six weeks or so.

The video doorbell was significantly less expensive than others on the market, and it connects to the sync controller used by my other blink cameras within my home. I was scared it might snap because it was made of poor plastic. The doorbell was then linked to the previous system's existing wiring.

I wanted to acquire the show so my wife could look at recipes while cooking, but I wasn't sure whether she would enjoy it because she dislikes having a lot of clutter on her kitchen countertops. Given our experience with echo devices around our home, claiming that this is the most responsive gadget we own is significant. I chose art on my home screen and enjoy the gorgeous landscapes it has. The only issue I have is that the speaker is at the rear, thus it is louder in the back than in the front when gazing at the screen. The sound is excellent and somewhat powerful. I needed another gadget so that I could add one to my creative studio. This one item has replaced so many things in my bedroom. I purchased this product for the show and tell function because I am visually impaired. Everyone enjoys them, which is fantastic. I was amazed at the sound quality of a gadget of this small. The show's audio quality has greatly improved. My family and I own numerous Alexa items and thoroughly appreciate them all. I have the show and wanted to utilize it with my Ring doorbell. I adore my Echo Shows...so much so that I've ordered one for every family member can you keep a secret and Amazon will deliver them and keep me secure. My wife likes being able to see recipes on the bright screen, and the sound quality is superior to our second-generation echo. I enjoy viewing the screen information as well.

Also, I recommend that everyone look at the Google Nest Hub, Lenovo, and the rest of the Echo Show smart system. The bad news is that I'm not sure I want to keep it. I truly appreciate the show's enormous clock face, and it seems insane that I have no clock selections on the program. No, the mac address displayed does not correspond to my actual mac address; I modified it to avoid appearing foolish in public. I like how I can make a slideshow of family photos that play on the display while it's not in use. Alexa is a moron. I own echo dots rev, echos show and echo auto. I was concerned that the screen would be very small, as on the Echo Show, but it is the same size as our old, boxy show. I keep it in the kitchen to play music, and it works perfectly. I will also be withdrawing it from service. The microphones on the echo show are substantially less sensitive than those on the first echo show in terms of hardware. I need the motion detection notifications when I'm working in my shop. and I've disabled most of them. It is beneficial in some situations, but I usually use mine for the camera and media consumption. It is intelligent enough to distinguish many users in your home. It's so horrible that my wife and I say things simply to see what it'll do next. It's absolute garbage, and I adore all of my previous gadgets. You can go into settings and disable adverts for websites and news, which is convenient. When this was one of the advertised perks, the system was poorly conceived. a nice Alexa gadget that performs what it claims to do. I know it's not awful internet reception since I can get up from the living room, walk to my bedroom, and have the dot read to me or play music for me all day. The sound is excellent and gets loud. All of the music can be heard throughout my apartment. The major reason is that some of the portions contain videos that, of course, cannot be watched on the Echo Plus. Would rate if not for the slide show issue, about which I have called with Amazon help numerous times and they are working on it.\"]"

I picked McAfee due to their years of experience and attempted for hours and hours to download and install. I started a conversation with tech support. McAfee was unable to assist me and I was sent to another department that was charging me money. Nothing product would not be installed on my machine. They felt as if Amazon had stolen them. I'd want to return this item from one of my current orders. I erased the computer that came with it since it kept the computer secure. I had the same thing but it expired, but I spent a lot more on it. I was unable to utilize it, thus it was a waste of my money. However, it occasionally crashed while my Windows update was being processed. I need to reinstall Windows and McAfee Total Security. I spotted the small Yahoo emblem in my search bar today. There have also been several complaints about the number that appeared on the McAfee website. Nobody knows why McAfee outsourced this, but it was a terrible error. Do not make a purchase. I would choose Norton if I had known before placing my order because I can have up to devices for the price, as opposed to this McAfee antivirus, which is only for devices. They want you to install a virus that will almost certainly harm your computer. The site will not allow you to download the application to your computer unless you sign up for an automatic reorder for the next year and provide them with your credit card information. This is a dodgy technique. However, you will be unable to register or activate this product unless you provide them with your credit card information, which they will use to automatically bill you when this year's product is about to expire.\"]"

    "references_nooie_neg =[\"Let me begin by stating, Oh my gosh, this camera is fantastic!! I contacted the manufacturer using their customer support website. We intended to install this camera in our baby's nursery, which is separated from the router by a wall. I don't speak softly, thus the built-in speaker is a detriment to me. The puppy was watching the light turn on, which piqued her interest...also a nice function if you use it as a security camera, which we will when the dog grows up. I just bought it because it showed up in a search for a baby monitor; in reality, it is an inside security camera comparable to a ring but nowhere near as good. However, it sends a motion sensor alert to the television and the cat passing by. It's also useful to know when he's sleeping so I don't wake him up by opening the door. Everything else about this camera is excellent. I'll be ordering another one, and I'm also interested in their outdoor camera! For the short days, I had it, it was a fantastic camera. I've heard several issues concerning the installation procedure and security. I will update my review as needed. update I updated our internet to g, and now this item won't function since it only supports g. Customer service is a farce. You cannot get a better deal for the money. Push notifications on the phone are fantastic, and the nooie produces no noise while intelligently the following motion around. If there was one thing I would have changed, it would have come with more than one wall hanger component. The app indicates that the wifi quality on both of my cameras is fine, but it does not display the image. This camera is quite simple to set up. I'm not sure if it's the camera's problem, the app's issue, or if I'm just in a terrible reception area at the time I checked. To be honest, I'll have to sleep in the baby's room until a new camera arrives. It can detect the baby screaming in the presence of a white noise machine... and sends notifications to my phone and watch so I never miss one! I enjoy that I can talk to this camera.\"]"

My major concern is how long the batteries will last. Like others, the volume on the camera needs to be louder; you can't hear it until you're next to it, but overall, we're pleased. I acquired it to safeguard my automobiles and the neighborhood mailbox. You may change the range of motion that the camera detects and tells you about. I enjoy the neighborhood aspects and am looking forward to seeing how this network develops. The rings app also works great with both cameras, letting me choose two distinct sounds for motion alerts so I know which camera is alerting. Both the camera and the solar panel are simple to set up. Because the spotlight is led, it is quite bright. The lighting is adequate but not overbearing. I gave it one star because of the client service. It was simple to set up and has appropriate lighting and an excellent camera. I wish the security light would stay on longer with a timer, but I love it, I love it, I adore this thing!! The cameras also include a space for a second battery, which I plan to purchase soon. I like it so much that I'm going to buy another video camera for the backyard. After only one day, I am happy with this product. I enjoy how this camera takes beautiful pictures. I didn't get much sun the day I placed it, but it still charged the battery everything about the camera itself is fantastic. The camera is precisely what I wanted, and the light is beautiful and bright, brightening up my entry area well. The greatest camera I've ever owned. Very simple to install and configure.\"]"

    "references_ring_neg =[\"I read a lot of reviews and almost didn't buy the camera because of them. We have a lot of deer, bunnies, and other animals in addition to our dogs, so our emotions are more frequent than in the usual home. In terms of video quality, these function well both at night and during the day. Overall, if you can install the wired camera, do it since you will be delighted with the camera's functions and video quality. I have high-speed spectrum internet with strong coverage across my home. I've stopped emailing and contacting Ring Tech Support since all they do is point the finger at those two items. I appreciate having a visible camera to dissuade intruders. I'm going to add two more around the house. I have Comcast gig internet, and the camera is less than ten feet away. You may, however, modify the detecting range, and once I repair it, it will identify you from further away. Furthermore, the ball mount appears to be rather fragile. This is not the camera for you if you want to record all the time. When I checked, it was frequently from the day prior, rendering the preview useless... aside from the fact that the views are not exhibiting current motion. We have Wyze cameras that we use indoors as puppy cams and love, but we wanted one to watch the outside of our house. Unfortunately, this was all it took for them to care about a consumer. They did not have the spare battery in stock at the time of purchase, so I had them install the camera with only one battery, and what a letdown. We appreciate this method and the information it provides. The camera quality is okay, but the primary issue for me is the camera's inability to tilt up, down, or sideways. WiFi indicates there is a bad connection, yet I still receive an excellent signal. I wanted greater coverage, and this camera captures the region where I required the most coverage, however it does not always function. Someone was at my front entrance, which is near to the router, and the camera never recorded anything. It's made of a lot of plastic, and after entering the battery and shutting the battery compartment, I didn't think this camera would withstand the weather, especially rain in a major storm.\"]"
