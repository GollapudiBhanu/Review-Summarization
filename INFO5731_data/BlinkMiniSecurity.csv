0,Haley,One major flaw.,"  I bought this to use as a baby monitor, thinking if the quality was good I would end up purchasing an outdoor set as well. I got it in this afternoon, and set up was super easy. The picture quality is excellent for the price point.The main issue for me is that there is no option for continuous viewing. The live view from the app will automatically shut off after 30 seconds if you don't tap the ""continue?"" prompt. If I had known this ahead of time, I would have never purchased a Blink camera. I watch my daughter on a Fire tablet while I work at night, and it's really not feasible to stop typing every 30 seconds to press a button.Maybe it's my fault for not realizing it, but I don't remember reading any information about the length of viewing time, so I assumed it would be like the Foscam I had sought to replace. If Blink ever adds an update for continuous viewing, I would repurchase in a heartbeat, but for now, I'm sending it back.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2020"
1,Ben,"UPDATED: Confusing cloud storage policy on these smaller cameras, but great product once clarified","  UPDATED: When I saw these smaller cameras announced I was excited and looked forward to adding them to my existing 5 camera Blink system. I figured these would be a great replacement for the XT/XT2 cameras that I had inside my house so I could then re-purpose those for additional outdoor locations. I thought this was a brilliant addition to the Blink camera ecosystem, adding a lower cost camera for indoor applications like mine where the benefits of the battery power and weather-proofness would be overkill. Soon as they were released I ordered up a two-pack to add to my system. I installed one of the them and found that the picture quality right out of the box wasn’t the best but once you change the video quality setting to “Enhanced” it’s right up there with the XT2 quality. The motion detection is a little spotty, as they use a new digital method of detecting motion (AI compares one frame to the next to check for changes). Some very subtle movement will show up, like a shadow moving across the viewing area, but then actually walking across it won’t (sometimes). A rep I spoke with said that they are working on an update to improve the consistency of that feature, which will be available as an over-the-air update since it is a digital-based feature, which I think is pretty cool. So originally my poor review was based around the cloud storage feature on these cameras. After I purchased these cameras I looked into the cloud storage feature as all of the literature I found on them stated that a subscription would be required. Since this is different than the previous XT & XT2 systems I was not pleased about this. After I posted my original review a rep from Blink reached out to clarify the cloud storage situation. So here is what I learned: If you already have an XT or XT2 system, then you can add these cameras to it without having to get a paid subscription. If you do not have a Blink system at all, and these cameras are the first ones you get, then you get a free subscription until December 31st, 2020; then you will pay $3/month per camera after that. By then though, they plan to have released a new sync module with an SD card slot so that you can locally store video clips without having to pay for a subscription at all. Personally I don’t think they intend to have too many people on the subscription plan, I think they see the SD card functionality being more of a selling point but they had to piggy-back the first adopters of these Mini cameras onto the cloud storage until the new sync module gets released. Maybe they had delays in getting the new sync module released at the same time as the Mini due to factory closings around the world right now. I am much happier after this getting cleared up, but hope that they update the cloud storage & subscription info on the product pages to make it much clearer how this all works. Had I looked at all of the available info before buying these, then I probably would not have purchased them based on the unclear info that’s out there. In the end, the savior of the situation was the rep that contacted me from Blink. He clarified all of my concerns, gave me a great amount of info on the product, and answered all of my questions (I had lot of them). To be clear, the rep did not once ask me to change my review, take it down, or in any way artificially influence me to do any of those things. The great job he did led to me to change this of my own accord, as they really took care of my concerns. One star deducted for the confusion but three added back in for the great CS experience. Good product can get you a buyer, but good service gets you a customer for life. Blink has done a fantastic job turning a disappointed (and misinformed) buyer into a satisfied customer. So to recap, if you have an existing Blink system, buy these and use ‘em where you don’t need the wireless ones. If you are looking to get these as your first Blink setup, get them knowing you will have the option of paying for a subscription starting in 2021 or a one-time purchase of a sync module with SD card slot to store your video clips.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2020"
2,Wcouv,Great cameras - Rushed app that is missing key features and was clearly designed for other cameras.,"  I pre-ordered 4 cameras without any reviews having been posted, so I hope that this helps someone.  First off, the cameras are pretty nice, very easy to setup and get connected and the price is just about perfect.  The app is where things start to fall apart.  It clearly was created for the other Blink cameras that are battery dependent, so most of the quirks/problems I found are probably necessary for battery savings on the other Blink cameras.  I have had cameras for well over ten years and have gone through several different apps/programs to access and store the video but I have never had an app that did NOT allow me to view all of my cameras at the same time. This one requires you to select a single camera and activate it individually to view real time video.  I assume that this was designed for battery savings, but since these cameras are always on, it now serves no purpose.  Additionally, not having the ability to view all of my cameras, while activated in a single 4 pane window seems a step in the wrong direction.  For years I have been able to see live feeds in a multi-pane format and select the camera I want to zoom in on that one, not with this app.Second, tech support is, at best, not good.  I contacted them regarding the IR light that apparently can NOT be turned off (although you can turn it off via the app for the other Blink cameras?!) and the support tech actually stated that he did not know anything about these cameras and had to ask someone else.  That was a first for me.  The IR light is probably not a big deal for most, but I have for years had an indoor camera pointed out a window since my front yard is pretty well lit at night and the IR light stuck in the ON position make that impossible.I never review anything, but I wanted to get the word out on this.  I suspect that these cameras were kind of rushed and the app just re-purposed, so it my sincere hope that they will address the live view concerns in future app updates specific to Blink Mini owners.  Soon I hope!!!!  Here's to hoping!Update:  I was contacted by Blink following regarding my review.  They indicated that multiple people had voiced similar concerns about the apps real-time capabilities and they made it sound like they were developing an update to the app to address this.  They also offered to send me an additional camera (an older model) that does allow you to turn off the IR at no charge.  I asked directly if this would be in exchange for changing my review and they specifically did NOT ask me to amend this review.  If nothing else, that is GREAT customer service.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2020"

   May 2021 Update: unfortunately I have had to downgrade my original review. After a year, Blink should have added the missing features listed below in my original review especially individual camera notification control. If you have more than one camera; this missing feature is a huge annoyance. The Blink forums have been asking for this simple feature for 3 years and Blink has been unresponsive. If these features are ever added, I will update my review and can recommend the Blink system again.I am very happy Blink is expanding their offerings and this little camera surprised me! We own a Blink XT2 system as well as Yi Cameras.This Camera makes a much better baby camera than the Blink XT2 and works perfectly with our existing XT2 system. I did not have to sign up for the cloud subscription and because Mini Recordings are free as part of our XT2 system (XT2 cameras do not require a subscription). This is a huge benefit and reason why people would purchase both the Mini and XT2. Hopefully, the free cloud storage stays for the Mini recordings, especially for people who own a XT2 system. The daily experience is good, the app works well for the features it does have, but the cons listed below are a big issue that Blink should easily resolve for all their cameras. I am still very happy overall.Pros:-Great build quality and design-Great picture quality-Very responsive when connecting to Echo Show (seems better than the XT2)-Small size-Mountable base-Weighted base (weight can be removed)-Long USB/power cord-Two way audio with App-Local storage option if you buy the new Sync 2Reliable AppCons:-No Two Way Audio with Echo Shows; both are Amazon companies, and I am not sure why this is not a feature already.-No individual camera arm/disarm scheduling (you are forced to schedule your entire system)-No individual camera notification control; Blink please also add this feature! This is extremely annoying especially as you add more cameras. I really only want notifications for our front door but want recordings without notifications for the rest of the House. I imagine most people would want the same thing.-Can’t continuously view on the App. This can be annoying especially for this camera in our case (we are using it as a baby monitor). You can continuously view with an Echo Show but it does cut out eventually.-Paid subscription for Cloud recordings; all other Blink cameras have free cloud recordings and it would have been better if this camera followed the same strategy.Overall, this camera would be perfect and get 5 stars once Blink fixes the few App features missing listed above. I have contacted Blink in various forms to inform them of the above missing simple features but the responses have been unimpressive. I plan to modify this review if the features are added, but unfortunately people have been begging Blink for these features for years.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2020"
4,Grant,NOT FOR HOME SECURITY!!!!!!!!! (Updated 5/12/20),"                    The media could not be loaded.
                




   UPDATE - 5/12/20: 3 stars to 2.  The camera cuts out for hours at a time. Essentially half the day there are no activities that trigger the camera. Not sure why the camera is inactive but essentially half the day it is not recording.For instance, Sunday night, the last recorded motion is 11:27 PM. Monday, the first recorded motion is 8:15 PM. Today there’s a lapse between 4:39 AM and 12:17 PM. Someone usually walks by my apartment at least every 10 minutes throughout the day. Very UNRELIABLE for home security. Should be 1 star, but it could be useful to someone as a live view for a 3D printer or something, but no time lapse feature.***** Look elsewhere for home security. I purchased the Yi Dome Cam + and I am extremely happy with that. Plus it has internal MicroSD storage for continuous recording and 360* capability.Note: I have it set to trigger on motion at all times, no scheduled breaks or turn off when I’m home.UPDATE - 4/30/20: 2 stars to 3. The development team has now added an option to turn off the night vision infrared lights. Thank you for being responsive. I still have an issue with the Retrigger time leading to a lapse in event recording, hopefully continuous recording could be an option in the future. Maybe with the combination of the Sync Module 2? Until this feature is added I would not recommend for home security.Original Review - 2 Star:I repeat, DO NOT use for home security. Look elsewhere for a home security solution.This camera is exclusively triggered by motion. While that sounds perfect for a security camera, it is a major downfall of the Blink platform. The camera searches for motion and records at the time it senses motion, and a little before. This is great, however it will only record up to 30 seconds. At this point, the recording stops and the camera has a grace period where it will not trigger due to motion again for a period of time. Blink has a setting for this break period and it can be adjusted, but can go no less than 10 seconds. So if you have an event that is 45 seconds long, you will record the first 30 seconds and the last 5 seconds, leaving you with a 10 second gap in your footage that could be key to solving a break in or similar event.Another issue I have is that the night vision can not be turned off. You can select “on” or “auto”. So if your camera is looking out a glass window at night you will not see anything, even if there is a light outside. The infrared LEDs can not go through the glass so you end up getting a terrible glare in the window and an almost completely black screen. Where if you could turn it off, it would see through the window to the street which is lit by an exterior light.In addition, the live view is ridiculous. You must tap a continue button every 15-30 seconds to keep watching the feed. If you do not tap the button when prompted, it backs out of the live view.As for the picture quality, it’s okay. You can’t read a license plate from 15 feet away though. And if you zoom in on someone’s face it would be hard to tell who they are from any more than 10 feet away. For the price though, it’s not terrible.I don’t care to go into detail, but the app is lacking in so many ways.I have returned this camera in search of a better solution. Next attempt is the Yi Dome Camera X.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2020"
5,Matt Smith,Useless toy nothing else.,"  This camera has zero features as far as ”security camera.”  what you needed to know before your purchase this toy:1) no memory card capability, meaning you have to have a subscription to the cloud service otherwise you won't able to record anything2) without cloud service deception, you can use only in ”live view.” which requires you to tap the screen every 30 seconds. It has no constant view option. So it is useless if you want to use it to monitor anything.3) you basically have an option to mute or have the volume on when live view. There is a volume adjust button with very little sensibility. So, you either have it very loud where your whole environment can hear what is going on, or you have to set it mute.4) not user friendly at all. The app that you have to use in order to access the camera is not user friendly at all. It has very small letters, hard to read. Even if you are able to read it, the Icons doesn't make any sense and has no explanation.5) The night vision is a joke. Through the camera view, you won't able to see a difference between a cat and a raccoon from 4 feet distance6) the software and the operating system is not ready to use. Most of the time when you are trying to access the camera view, it says ""system is busy please wait."" What does it mean, I have no idea.7) considering all of the major issues that comes with this camera, I would never trust to purchase a cloud service from a company who poorly designed and taught through the whole idea of a ""security camera"".8) price! For almost 40 bugs plus a cloud plan, You will end up paying $100 for the first year. For this price, you can purchase a decent system that truly serves your needs.I have watched many videos on Youtube about this camera. But none of them are telling these.

6,Matt Smith,Easy set up but app is lacking,"  I’m a Blink XT user with three cameras on the exterior of my home. The set up of the mini was FAR EASIER than the outside cams. I had this thing set up in less than 5 minutes. Picture is good. Sound is LOUD which is what I was looking for.The app however needs some work to support this style of camera. The app works decently for the BlinkXT cameras and functionality, which is motion for most users. As in you get a notification that there is motion, it records, and you watch the recording or live as you please. but it is clunky to get into the Blink Mini for the purpose of continuous viewing which is my intention for this camera, like a baby monitor. Like many other Americans now working from home with a full house of kids, I wanted to use this to assist with keeping an eye on the kids as I worked and record those cute moments. I wanted to use this to visualize a blind spot that I can’t see from the office. I tried mounting it from the ceiling and realized you can’t rotate the video. Mounting on the wall was a little problematic, I couldn’t quite get the right angle needed.Another quirk to the app is if you switch to another app and then come back to the Blink app, you have to hit the play button to resume viewing.All in all, these are minor issues specific to my use of the camera which is why I have it five stars anyway.Hey amazon/Blink, it would be an awesome feature if you’d allow the integration of this camera with Alexa so we can “drop in” and talk through the Echo Dot.

8,Johnny,Vendor changes terms and FORCES monthly storage fee more than a year later - DO NOT BUY BLINK,"  When I originally bought my EIGHT Blink cameras I liked how easy they were to set up.  I was annoyed with intermittent problems connecting to WiFi and the less than competent support.  I was at least satisfied for something this cheap to provide the level of security I needed. More than a year later - I can no longer have it record and store the video on my phone.  They now REQUIRE you pay a monthly fee for storage - even though I have only used my phone up until now.Blatantly sleazy. While I could care less about the money I spent buying the system, the fact that they would strip away basic functionality and force me to now pay more in one year than what I did for one of the cameras just to store what I have been storing on my phone is shocking.

9,A. Reynolds,“LIVE VIEW FAILED” error constantly,"  I wanted to love these. I ordered 2, the price for both was great and the other BLINK products had good reviews. Initial setup was very easy, user friendly and quick. The app itself, as many state is lacking with the live preview not being displayed like most all other home monitoring systems. I’m sure that can be fixed with an update in the future, so not really a huge deal. My biggest problem is that DAILY I get an error saying “LIVE VIEW FAILED” when I try to click into either camera. The only thing that resolves it is unplugging my cameras and plugging them back in. Which on the daily, kinda defeats the purpose of home monitoring, especially if I’m not home to do it, then I’m out of luck. My internet connection is not the issue, I have tested that numerous times thinking maybe that was it, but every time it does not display any issues. I also have a very fast connection speed. It’s frustrating to spend any amount of money and not get a properly functioning product.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2020"
10,ChicagoGamerGuy,Known issue with Motion Detection. Cameras are essentially defective,"  I purchased several Blink XT2 cameras for the outside perimeter of our home and they work reasonable well so I ordered a pair Blink Mini Cams for the inside.There seems to be some issue with the motion detection feature with these cameras.  There are times where it essentially doesn’t work meaning I can walk across the room, get within inches of the camera, and no motion alerts are generated.This is extremely disappointing as these cameras are designed to only record when motion is detected. They are essentially defective as the motion detection feature does not work consistently.This appears to be a known issue with the current firmware but they continue to sell the camera despite the fact they are defective.

14,AmazonCustNewnan,Junk,"  App doesn't explain what ""sensitivity"" means - is 1 ""most sensitive"" or ""least sensitive""? You'll have to Google it to find out! But it doesn't really matter what setting you use - I have one camera pointed right up my front walkway, and every bug in a five mile radius will set it off at night, but I've had multiple FedEx, UPS and USPS deliveries during the day and Blink didn't capture anything at all. In fact, the reason I'm finally writing this I just went out a walk a half hour ago, and Blink didn't capture my coming or going at all. GREAT!Also - and this is inexcusable - the app doesn't allow for multiple users. If you want your spouse or child to have access to the cameras\app, you have to give them your login info. Or maybe you want someone like a babysitter or housesitter to have ""read-only"" access to the app? Nope. It's give someone total administrator rights, or nothing at all. To make matters worse, I've read several cases of couples sharing logins but only one person getting notifications.This was my first foray into ""home security"" type stuff, and honestly it was a waste of $100.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2020"

17,Tiny Pieces LLC,I'm having problems with mini blink speaker,"  Okay I just received my little camera about an hour ago. I have unpact the camera have it up on the shelf and I've downloaded the blink camera app from the Play Store. I've only been playing with it for about 30 minutes. I'm sure there is a learning curve to this camera. The one thing that I don't like at this moment is when clicking on the talk button, theres way too much feedback from the camera speaker. Also when holding down the talk button, my phones speaker picks up on any noise that comes from the movement of my thumb while on the talk button. So at this point I'm not happy with the camera there is too much feedback static interference and Echo from blink camera, I pray for you right now but I want to just start over for that reason that's why I have given it a 1-star.

The two cameras that I received today are still giving me the same issue of static Echo feedback a loud squealing sound and again feedback while tapping and holding down the talk button.

18,Model Cars Magazine,Easy set up and great image quality,"  This is a great little camera monitor. Pros: easy set up, easily managed with your smart phone, clear image quality with motion detection. Can be set up to arm and record at any time. I bought this to use in my master bedroom by my desk where I keep sensitive information.Cons: if you are using it with another Blink product and you arm 24/7 then the other Blink unit also needs to be armed which is an issue because my other unit uses 2 AA batteries. There is no timer on the app to set up a time to arm which would by useful because I sometimes forget to arm at night. It has good night vision quality. It needs to be plugged in so is a problem if you put it in a place (i.e. bedroom closet) if there is no outlet. Because of this, it is difficult to make the camera more hidden (if you are looking for a nanny camera for example).Overall it is easy to use and I would recommend it for a basic home security camera.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2020"
19,J. Cofer,"Blink Mini has NO local storage (without spending more $), Wyze is still better","  Build-wise the camera is high quality, very nicely built and doesn't feel cheap. Picture quality is good too, but what makes this $35 camera not as good as its main competitor (Wyze) is the app features and not-so-clear-and-slightly-confusing video recording functions.The main complaint is there is no live view when you open the app. In other words, you can have multiple Blink video cameras but all you get when you open the app is a screenshot. To see actual live footage you have to tap on each camera individually. It might seem like a small complaint but when you can open up the Wyze app and see all cameras live-view at the same time without extra steps, you can see which is more convenient.The next thing is the premium subscription recording options. Cloud storage has a fee, local storage DOES NOT EVEN EXIST without an optional hub you have to purchase later - yes, the local recording feature that is included in every Wyze camera (be it the $19 v2 or the $35 Pan) is only available with the Blink camera when you buy the hub... which isn't even available to purchase as of this writing.When I pre-ordered this camera I was hoping that considering it was coming from the Blink brand, that it would have been at minimum equal to (if not better than) its lower cost competition. But I feel like this was targeted towards already established Blink customers who might already be familiar with how the Blink camera ecosystem works, and they did not take into consideration what features their competition already offers..So in the end I decided I was returning the Blink camera for another Wyzecam instead. I really wished it was an upgrade to the Wyze camera I'm using now, but after trying it out I can say that it is not. Also, the fact that they amended their product description with ""live view is not continuous"" after all of the reviews complaining about this on day 1 tells you something.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2020"
20,Chris Shaw,Hope You Never Move & That Their Cloud Service Works Indefinitely,"  The Blink Mini worked really great out-of-the-box when I first bought it. The moment I changed the SSID of the camera and the SSID of the network it became completely confused about what to do. Deleting the save camera settings and adding it again via the QR code added the camera but it then continued to add itself automatically to a neighbor's wireless network somehow. Even by overriding this with my own network, which it said it was connected to, it continued to search for the camera even though it had found it during the process off asking for the QR code. It appears that if I had not changed any settings ever after initial installation camera would have been great. If you never plan to move or change network settings this camera may be great for you. Otherwise be cautious and look into alternatives. This was my first foray into motion cameras and I am pretty disappointed as a simple change of settings has rendered it useless.EDIT: Customer Support had very helpful to troubleshoot the problems I had and now there's another problem about it saving to a cloud service. If that service happens to be down, which it has been down several times, it does not save the clip that is picked up from motion nor can any other clips be view in the app. Is there an option to store everything locally that I am missing? It really needs to have this feature.EDIT: It took two days for the cloud service to respond and suddenly 40 videos show up in the video section of the app. That is not helpful at all if that sort of delay is going to be consistent.EDIT: Moved the camera again and resetting everything has proven fruitless. No blinking light and it is connected to the new wireless network. After the first incident I was given another camera but it is still sealed in the box as there is no point in opening it unless there is actually something wrong with the one I have. This camera seems to work well for others judging from the reviews so maybe I got a lemon. I do not know but I am tired of bothering with something that was supposed to be a breeze to set-up. I am ignoring the Blink line of products from now on.Edit: As stated before the cloud service stops working and asks for a subscription. This is very silly as being able to save videos locally is not a new feature to cameras on a network. Now the camera is useless without purchasing additional hardware such as the sync module. Very disappointed I chose to go with Blink and wish I had known how this was going to go down the road. Do not buy this camera unless you are willing to pay for a subscription or if you are buying the sync module too. I am not touching anything with the Blink name on it going forward as I feel quite foolish.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2020"
21,Riz,Not impressed - many false alarms AND just stops detecting motion,"  So far, I am not at all impressed.The camera's motion detection is going off very frequently just from blowing tree limbs & shadows, but is missing cars going in and out of the driveway, the front door opening, people moving around, etc. (The camera is aimed right at the front door and driveway, and picks up motion in these places SOME of the time--maybe 30%.)I cannot find a ""user guide"" for the app and the online ""support"" is configured as a series of ""how to"" blurbs using jargon you'd only know once you've been using the system, so it's very difficult to find info as a new user. (I graduated magna cum laude with a BS degree in computer science & have been a professional software engineer--writing software and supporting documentation for everything from hardware controllers to radar systems to 3-D modeling--for decades, so I'm not a technology idiot--this is a poorly designed, executed, and supported system.) There should be an easy to find & use Getting Started Guide that provides app and system overviews. Just a 1-page Quick Start Guide in the box would make a big difference. Right now, I simply want to know what all the icons and buttons on the app mean, and cannot find an explanation of them.Based on what I read on the user forums, the app gets changed with no explanation to users, so even if you do figure it all out, it can change and suddenly there are new or changed icons & you have no idea what they do. Although I've figured out enough to get the whole thing set up, it's not intuitive, and I've used other similar security cameras and apps. I still have not figured out some of this app. Plus, the online/app info tries to cover all the Blink camera models, even though they don't all work the same, so that could be confusing to some users.If there's a way to access your camera's live feed or the recordings from a desktop/laptop PC/Mac (vs. app on phone/tablet), I haven't found it yet.The camera quality is OK and the 2-way talk seems to work in testing, but I don't know what it'll be like in a real world scenario. You cannot record more than a 30 second clip. It's difficult to tell when you are in ""live"" viewing mode. The app interface is just not well designed. I haven't had time to experiment with everything--have wasted too much time just trying (and mostly failing) to find basic information.No idea what the ""local"" (non-Cloud) storage Blink talks about will be like--I can't find much info about that, either. It seems like it'll be in a device that's on your WiFi network so the camera can communicate with it, and would therefore be exposed to the world. A closed system would be more secure. The storage will obviously NOT be in the camera itself--there's no place for even a microSD card. An SD (or micro) card in the camera would be a good idea (at least as an option).And one more thing--Blink is ""an amazon company."" So why is the app not available for Kindle devices?UPDATE: I've been using this camera for a couple of months now and it is such a mixed bag. I like the ""activity zones"" that (theoretically) allow you to define the areas to detect motion. And the image is pretty good. The audio is so-so. But the motion detection is terrible--and I've tried all the setting options. I have mine mounted in an outdoor mounting kit, under a protective roof. The thing goes off constantly--every 30 seconds, for rain, wind, shadows, bugs (bugs seem to be drawn to the camera's blue light at night), a slight change in lighting due to a distant car headlight, any little thing--it will sometimes get literally hundreds of constant triggers over a few hours over nothing, but EVERY SINGLE DAY (including overnight), it just sometimes just stops detecting anything, even cars and people being very active all over the entire viewing area. If I ""go live"" for a moment, it seems to start detecting motion again! For a while, anyway. This is maddening. It completely defeats the purpose of the camera. The frequent ""false alarms"" made me turn off notifications because it was dinging constantly, and the inability to detect REAL motion makes no sense. Having to ""reset"" the camera daily, sometimes multiple times in 24 hours, is crazy.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2020"
22,Fran,Bait and Switch - Existing Customer Subscription Scam,"  I originally purchased the blink system because of the “no subscription” and “free cloud storage for life” promises. I needed to add a few cameras inside, and before purchasing these I called both Amazon and Blink directly to confirm that adding the new Blink Mini cameras would not trigger a subscription (I’m not interested in paying for a subscription). When I called before purchasing, both the Blink rep and the Amazon rep confirmed the same thing: “since you are an existing Blink customer, you are ‘grandfathered’ in for free lifetime cloud storage, just call back after installing the cameras and we will add them to your grandfathered cloud storage account.” So that’s what I did. But when I called back after spending an entire afternoon on ladders installing the new cameras, I was told that I would need to purchase a subscription! It’s a simple bait-and-switch” scam. Apparently the first reps gave me “bad information” according to the Blink reps and supervisor that I spoke with today.Honestly, the entire customer experience has been so bad that I wish I could send it all back for a refund; the original cameras and the new ones. I feel ripped off and the entire customer service experience was horrible (I spoke with three people, on the phone and hold for over an hour; three calls, was hung up on, and the answers and service were both bad.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2020"

I've tried all the other brands out there WYZE, etc and disappointed with all. Then I tried the Blink Mini which I thought was a good price. The setup was a breeze, up and running in 30 seconds. The app is responsive and user friendly. My wifi is sloooow but it still loaded a 1080p HD quality view w hen I accessed it from my mobile app. My favorite feature is the night vision.

25,Lisolet,Nearly useless for real-time observation. 2-way comm doesn't work with Amazon Show sold with it.,"  This is my original review.-5 star picture quality for $30! What is up with these cords?-  Just set them all up with the Show 5 that I ordered them with. Awesome quality.  The 3 meter Micro USB cords with the bulky, generic Amazon 5v power brick is a big ""Huh?"" though. Already ordered much longer ones. No 2-Way communication through the Amazon Show 5 I ordered with it as a combo. That seems odd.  I can make video calls with the Show 5 but not communicate with someone in the room that I am viewing and listening to on the Blink Mini.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  This is my experience that I relayed to a representative who personally emailed me about my initial 3 star rating then told me ""It is what it is."" in short.

I ordered some 25ft cables so Ican move the plugs. I sent pictures of the ""joke"" setup I made ,to testthem, before I got my 25ft cables. Not very safe for a kids room.It also should be made very clear to customers that you can only monitorthe cameras through the Blink mobile app, a Show or similar Amazondevice.

27,Chris M.,Useless if you plan to use as baby cam or continuously streamed security cam - avoid,"  UPDATE: I found the perfect baby cam in another inexpensive Wyze camera here on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076H3SRXG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1I guess since the Blink Mini is marketed as a security camera, I shouldn't judge it so harshly based on its babycam abilities. As a security camera I think it works well and does what it's supposed to do. I still think having an extended Live View would help even in security scenarios, for example if you wanted to watch an area for an extended time. In any case, I will be using the Wyze as a baby cam and the Blink as a security cam so I bumped up to 4 stars.Original Review:If you're buying these as a baby cam or continuously streamed security cam, don't! I bought a 2 set of these cameras to use as baby cameras, planning on adding a bunch of them to put in every room, and it's unfortunate because even though everything else is great, they have a fatal flaw - there isn't any live view option to keep the camera running for more than 30 seconds at a time. You have to hit a manual ""continue"" button to keep the live view going, which there is no reason for, as these are not battery powered. I have other outlet-powered security-type cameras and none of them have a manual live view continue button - they just stay on as long as you want to keep watching.There was no mention of this ""you must press a continue button every 30 seconds to keep live view going"" in the product description until a couple days ago I believe. Maybe people have been complaining. If I had known in advance I would not have bought the cameras.Other than that the picture quality is very good and setup is easy. I will be checking out the cheaper priced Wyze cameras next, although that company has issues of its own, regarding security it seems. Unfortunate about this product's live view fail, because otherwise seems like a great camera for the price.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2020"
28,Blonde Blooper,These cameras are junk if you don't pay the cloud extortion.,"  I really liked these cameras. They worked perfectly until the free cloud storage ran out. From the beginning, I planned to use a blink sync module 2 to record once the free cloud storage ended. From everything I read on amazon, this should have been a seamless process. It was the exact opposite.It took 2 weeks to get all the cameras to record. The blink minis only record when they feel like it. Amazon has removed most of the features in the app that worked with the cloud to try to force you to buy cloud storage.  All thumbnail images have been removed. Sorting events by camera has been removed. Etc. Etc. It's now a dumbed down version of the app, making it the worst and most basic of any home security app that I've ever seen. I would pay for a working app, if one existed. I would write my own, if an api existed. Amazon claims blink works with IFTTT but there are no functions for recording or accessing the files on the sync module.I can only access files for around 40 hours. After that they disappear from the app. I cannot save live views. I cannot just click record when I want to record with something. And they have purposely made this thing slow to try to get you to buy cloud storage. They say it's slower because it's usb. I call BS. If I'm in my house, on the same wifi network as the sync module, it should be way faster to access a local usb drive(I bought the fastest one made), than leaving the network, accessing amazons cloud, returning to my network and then having my network serve the file to my phone. I'm not stupid. I have shared usb drives connected to my router and other devices on my network. When I access them it's almost instant. I don't get a message that says ""please wait: USB drives are slow"". That is a timer that was put in by the coders to make it slow.I could go on and on but I have other things to do.DON'T buy these cameras unless you want to pay cloud storage for the life of the camera.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2021"

Technical issues forced me to return the camera; the technical support was useless. 1 star, can't recommend.PROS- Great picture quality.- Two-way voice communication worked well.- Motion detection was accurate and alerts were sent in a timely fashion.- Easy to set upCONS- Only records up to 30 seconds per ""motion event"" or manual trigger, and forces a 10-second cooldown before recording again.- No local storage option; network goes down? So does the camera. There's a new device ""coming soon"" according to Blink to handle local storage, but it isn't available as of this writing and there's no software options available to store or download videos with a PC.- Unreliable connectivity; the camera would work for 5-10 minutes at a time, then drop off the network. It'd reconnect eventually, but then drop off again a few minutes later. The reported signal strength was 85-90%. Tech support couldn't resolve this.- Ridiculously bad tech support; it's obviously outsourced (if I was really talking to ""Cherry,"" then I'm a Chinese jet pilot), there's a major language barrier, they don't pay attention to what you actually say, won't share diagnostic information with you (even when they record it with an app they ask you to download), and make useless suggestions (like ""contact your ISP and have them reconfigure your network"" with no details about *what* needs to be reconfigured). They also repeat steps that have already been tried and didn't help. Clearly they're following a (bad) script and aren't able to help beyond that.

It had nothing to do with my Internet and it sounded like thousands of other people on the website also had the same issue. When it did stay online it wouldn’t always connect for a live view. alerts/video recording when motion was detected was sporadic. The night vision was grainy and not always easy to make out. The final straw for me to write this review was when it stopped recording and told me I had to buy either a $3 a month membership or a $10 a month membership to save videos just to watch when any motion is detected. Apparently you only get a free trial for a few months. Just long enough to see how poorly the product works.  I can’t even get a live view on the camera anymore without paying the monthly fee. It’s literally worthless now. I’m not going to pay a monthly fee to record when the camera was unreliable to begin with.I’m not one to write poor product reviews.

34,Santokki,Almost perfect for my use... almost,"  I purchased the Blink Mini to use in our house to help us monitor our toddler. I bought the two pack because I wanted one in my son's room and one in the living room. Prior to this, we were using an old webcam in my son's room. My parents have the outdoor Blink cameras and they spoke highly of them, so I thought the indoor one would work great for my need. It's like a webcam, but with bonus features, right?Pros:• Easy to setup• Clean and small design• Picture quality night and day seems good - especially compared to our old webcam• Range you can see in the room is good• I like that you can select certain areas of the room to tell you if there's motion. So I have the area around my son's bed set to notify me when there's movement. That way when he moves around ON his bed it doesn't notify me but when he gets off his bed it does.Cons:• My biggest con is that the Live Feed only lasts for 30 seconds before you have to hit a button to ""continue"". I understand why this setting was created for the battery powered units, but this unit is always connected to power. Ideally, there would be setting letting you choose your preferred length. Even 5 minutes at a time before having to hit the refresh would be great. I like to be able to monitor my son when he goes down for his nap which can last anywhere from 5-30 minutes. I'm usually working during this time and having to hit the ""continue"" button every 30 seconds, or restart the camera every couple of minutes gets frustrating.• There's an echo when you talk through the microphone. Makes it harder to use and hear. For me, this isn't a big deal as I don't plan to use this feature.Overall, I like it and it's worth the money. If they fix the Live View feed length, this would make a great baby monitor too. And I'm REALLY hoping they do fix it.-- Why didn't I buy a baby monitor? I never found one that seemed worth the cost. Each one I researched always seemed to have a BIG flaw about it even at all price points. So I gave up until I saw the Blink Mini. If I had known there was the Live View restriction, I probably wouldn't have bought it in all honesty since it hinders the use of it. Here's to hoping it's a feature they fix in the future. --",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2020"

41,Our Tiny Feet,Night Vision Switching Problem - new firmware please,"  I am certain the auto night vision switching problem can be fixed with a firmware update to fix the light sensitivity threshold for turning on/off the night vision feature.Currently, it is not turning on/off at the right time for a given light condition.  For example, in the early morning, the it doesn't turn night vision off until 8 AM, when there is plenty of ambient light.  So for the 2 hours before 8 AM, it fails to detect any motion (even if a person is walking 5 feet in front of it).  I think it's because the night vision IR lamp, combined with an 8 AM ambient lighting condition, is over exposing the scene to the point where the whole scene is completely white - this prevents the camera from identifying movement and triggering a recording.  I have 2 of these cameras, and both have the same problem.  Perhaps the firmware and app should be updated to give you the option to enter a specific time for turning the night vision on/off.  Or it should turn off the night vision much sooner or at a darker condition.Everything else seems to work as advertised.  The video quality is great.

I love that I now have all of my cameras on a single app.  These do everything that I need them to.  They have a great wide field of view and when positioned right, they pick up nearly all of an average sized bedroom.  The night vision is good.  The audio is great and I was surprised how good the speaker is on the camera itself!  I can talk from my phone to the camera and it actually sounds good and intelligible from the camera.  The previous camera I was using as a baby monitor was 10x harder to set up, didn't work 25% of the time, and the audio from the camera's speaker made me sound like an unholy demon.  I am very happy with the Blink Mini cameras so far!At first I was a bit upset of the lack of free cloud video storage whereas my Blink XT2 cameras have free cloud storage.  But, for what I'm using them for, I don't need the cloud storage at all.  I need the storage for the Blink XT2 cameras that I use for security, but I don't see any need for cloud storage for a baby monitor.  I can peek in on my kids when I'm at work without any problem as well.The Blink Mini for me is the perfect solution for my situation.  It may not be great for everyone, but I think that the simplicity of this camera makes it a great fit for most people.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2020"

   I love my new Blink Mini. For $30, I think you get a lot for your money. The Blink Mini is doing the same thing my Amazon Cloud Cams do but for a lot less. I am using the camera to monitor one of my garage cats. I can tell she's ""tucked in"" for the night and when she goes out in the morning. Gives me piece of mind. I have not mounted the camera because in the winter there may be more of my cats in the location seeking warmth, and I may need to adjust the viewing area. This camera will make that easy. Quality is good when there is a light on nearby and in the dark. One night I talked to her through the app, and she looked up. That was also reassuring.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2020"

46,nebraska,"OMG Avoid, not worth it.","  Over a year of use and now . . . Not free, whether you have an existing acct or not. The HD picture quality day or night is way below any usefulness, yes you could see movement but nothing beyond that.  Detection of movement is hit and miss, as is the wifi connection.  Batteries do not last beyond 6 months, even on cameras that rarely record, it must be a weather thing they don't account for at all.  Ultimately, Not worth buying AT ALL. Wish I could return all Blink cameras. Stick with wired or other wireless cameras that actually deliver on what they claim. It was a great deal for the price until you realize the deal actually never delivered on what was claimed, advertised, promised.

47,Jeily,Amazing tiny camera,"  I just got the new blink mini x 2.  I have been using for a few days now.  I currently own 10 indoor and outdoor cameras from nest that i love and have never had issues with for several years.  I also had a few blink wireless cameras for areas where electric was and issue.  These blink mini camera work just like my Nest camera as far as quality of pic, night vision, alerts ect.  Why I say the blink mini is amazing ?

48,Jeily,Major Disappointment,"  UPDATE 9/13/20What I feared - and predicted - would  happen came to pass. Last Friday, 9/11/20, my landlord called me and asked me to review the footage on my cameras because another tenant had seen someone on the premises behaving suspiciously. I checked my Blink Mini app on my cell phone and sure enough.NOTHING.As usual, the cameras had STOPPED WORKING the night before sometime around midnight. As a result, there was nothing recorded during the day on Friday. Nothing.A few days earlier, I spoke to Amazon who said that, since the 30 day window had passed, there was nothing they could do. They suggested I deal directly with Blink, even though Bling is OWNED BY AMAZON, supposedly. I called Blink ""tech support"" (laughable) at the number the Amazon rep gave me.I wound up wasting 35 minutes with a woman who knew nothing about the Blink system, could barely speak English, and whose background sounded like she was rattling pots and pans in her kitchen. She asked me to hold a few times and, so help me, it sounded like all she was doing was rattling things around to give the appearance that she was actually doing something.As I've mentioned before, the Blink Mini cameras UTTERLY FAIL at their primary, stated, function: to provide you peace of mind relative to home security. Neither Amazon nor Blink will be of any help to you in getting your issue resolved and the only thing you will have accomplished it to waste your money.It's too late for me but if you are considering purchasing this system, I advise you in the strongest possible terms to look elsewhere. You may want to shop at Costco since they have a very liberal return policy.I hope people get to read this review since it appears Amazon has obscured many one-star reviews from site and only a few show up on the Blink Mini page. Do not waste your money on this camera.UPDATE 9/2/20I received an email on 7/28/20 from a Blink employee named Haitham. In part, he wrote:""I would like to clarify that we are fully aware of this issue where the camera will stay on the night mode and not fully recognize that it has to switch to the day mode, and that will mostly happen in the early morning once the sun rises. We are working one the fix and it should come automatically to your camera. In the meantime as a work around, you may need to schedule disarming the system in the early morning and arm it back right after.""As of today, ZERO has happened.I want to be clear that the Blink mini camera can be a genuine hazard to your well being because of this issue. It simply goes off a ledge around midnight and NEVER wakes up unless you remember to wake it. This means you could be away from home and be burglarized. You think you're covered because you have the Blink camera system only to discover that it has recorded absolutely nothing.The worst case scenario is you and your family go out to dinner. While you're out, intruders get into your home. Since the camera stopped working at midnight yesterday, you are completely unaware you have unwelcome guests until you return home and walk in on them.In short, this system poses a danger to your well being because it fails in its stated purpose. Since Blink has done nothing to correct this problem, which is purely software based, you will be taking your chances by purchasing this system.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I purchased a two-pack of the Blink Mini. What attracted me was the low cost of the item. They were $35 each or the two-pack for $65. Turns out I might just as well have taken $65 and thrown it out the window. Of a moving car.I only set up one camera by a window, looking out through the glass. I was very happy to see that the motion sensing worked and it should have since all it's doing is noting changing pixels. I was also happy to see that the microphone was sensitive enough to pick up what was being said on the other side of a dual-paned window.However, for some reason the camera decided to stop working or, more specifically, to stop sensing and recording motion. I first noticed this when I fired up the Blink app and noticed that all the clips were tagged ""Yesterday"" and none from ""Today"".It turns out that, for some reason, the camera seems to decide that its work is done sometime around midnight. Beyond that, it will NOT record ANY video UNLESS I proactively disarm and re-arm the motion sensing on the camera via the app. Alternatively, I can do a ""Live"" view to see what the camera is seeing, also through the app. Both of these actions have the effect of seeming to ""wake"" the camera up to a new day. From that point on, it will continue working as normal. Until midnight. At that point the whole process begins again.Another odd thing is that it records video - when it decides to actually work - only for a specified period of time, between 5 and 30 seconds. It OUGHT to work like motion sensing lights that turn on and remain on for a specified period of time BUT will stay lit if it continues to sense motion. These cameras should continue recording if the motion they detected continues or resumes within the designated video clip length. In other words, if you set a clip length of 15 seconds and 12 seconds into it the motion resumes, it should keep recording until there is no motion.The point of these cameras is to be able to set them up and forget about them until you are notified it senses motion. In this regard, the system is a complete failure. I tried power cycling the camera by physically disconnecting it from the power supply then reconnecting. Nothing. I tried deleting the camera from the app and re-installing it. Nothing. It's got nothing to do with the app because it has no physical connection to the camera. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and all the camera settings I had previously set were still intact, so it ain't the app.As a last resort I did the unthinkable: I called ""tech support"". What I got was a call center somewhere in the Philippines and one of those maddeningly persistently cordial persons who is anything BUT ""tech support"".  I finally just let him believe he actually helped me and ended the call.So here I am without a functional camera system and, of course, well past the return date. The bottom line here is that this system, ostensibly meant to alert you if there is an intrusion into your home, simply CANNOT be relied upon for that purpose. Your home could be broken into and you would be none the wiser. You would be much better off to do your research and purchase a system that, while potentially more expensive, will at least serve its stated purpose. This one does not.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2020"
49,Wayne,"Terrible problems with motion detection, and little help from customer service",  The overall picture quality is good.  I have no issue with that part of the system.  My issue is the fact that the motion detection was not working from the start.  It would send me notifications around 50% of the time.  I tested it myself several times and would not get a notification.  I had previously used a Dlink camera system and did not have any issues with the motion detection.  I emailed customer service at Blink for assistance in determining the root cause of the issue.  After 5 or 6 emails back and forth with them blaming my internet service to my capabilities of setting the camera up I decided to go back to my previous camera.  I test many things that they requested and found that none of the problems were stemming from anything but the camera itself.  I only switched because I wanted a bit better view from the camera but it does not have much of a purpose without motion detection.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2020"
50,Rabie Allowh,Changing to Thumbs DOWN,"  This camera came free with my Echo Show. It works great, No issues. Easy to setup and works flawlessly.My only complaint/observation is that I wish it was easier to save videos other than just live stream.  I noticed a few saved vids on my phone from this camera, but god knows how they got there. I can't figure out how to actually save them... they just seem to pop up. I've looked in the app-ware, but can't fine options... Kinda weird. Who knows may figure it out eventually.2 Mar 2021 - Updating this review and changing the rating. I put this camera in my garage to monitor the door. Then I started having issues opening and closing the garage door. The wall button worked (wired), but none of my remotes did. Not even the one in my car. I thought my Opener went buy buy and started looking to buy a new one. In the course of t-shooting, I disconnected the Blink CAM (sense it was the last thing I did in there) and all worked again. WTF. I finally figured out (with some Web help) that Cheap LEDs on cameras (or the cameras themselves) will emit stray RF/IF and disable some garage door devices. REALLY???? Wow  So I covered all 3 LEDs with dark tape. BAM!!!! Everything works as advertised. Seriously??? So this Camera is no good for me in the garage (which is where I wanted it.) Heads Up if this is why you are looking to but it.UPDATE: 25 Mar 2021 - Updating again because I want to make sure everyone knows NOT to buy this camera. First of all besides the issues I have had above, recently More issues have shown. Camera keeps cutting off. No reason I can find... just stops working. Unplug and re-plug in and it works again. ????? Besides that, Every time I'm away from my WiFi, I can not view the feed/camera from my phone. The app keeps telling me it can't connect to the internet and there is not connection. Hmmmm ALL my other camera work with NO issues. It's not my internet connection. As soon as I get home it connects with no issues. But what is the point if it's for monitoring my house/garage while I'm not there.  I'll be buying something to replace this. (hey it was free, but still...)Sorry Amazon this camera is not all it's built up to be.

51,Adam Fink,do not buy this product,"  This is by far the biggest piece of garbage I have ever purchased.  I cannot rate the picture quality because I can't get past the setup. You know the setup that the box says is only three easy steps, except they don't mention that the third step actually leads to 25 more steps and will eventually never connect so it is completely unusable.I have 1g internet service running on a mesh system in my home.  This ridiculous device frequently tells me it can't find my network and certainly never broadcasts its own little blink network its supposed to so you can connect it.  It might be the best camera in the world but ill never know because it apparently doesn't want to let me.  Let me list some of the problems I've had over the last two hours of frustration.The qr code on the box doesn't work.If you set things up on the order the box tells you, the app just makes you do it all again in a different order.Tells me it can't find my network.Clearly won't broadcast its network.Every time you almost have it set up thw stupid blue light goes out and you have to start over.Enough is enough.  Im sending this back and want a full refund.  Ill be buying another ring camera.  Thought I'd take a chance on something new branded by Amazon.

52,Maryann T. Miller,Save your money because cameras are useless if account after 2020,  camera is basically useless after the free trial is over with. Now I have to find a new way to keep my eyes on my home when not at home. I understand a subscription but when you want to self monitor they need an option that will record while you are viewing it live so in the event of something going on at the house I can continue to watch and call 911 and tell them what’s going on and have it all saved to go back over later on for training and teach my children what they could have done better and how to learn from a situation like that in the event I’m not able to help. Also I hate that while viewing I have to continue to push the continue button to keep watching as it is so annoying. If I didn’t want to view I wouldn’t be viewing. Please disable that and fix it to have continuous viewing along with continuous recording. Until then I will no longer recommend blink products. I have a useless paperweight that really isn’t going to hold a piece of paper down. People nowadays like the option to self monitor and record without having to pay a subscription. Only 10 cameras for the largest subscription offered and that’s the most stupidest thing. If I was gonna pay I would want to pay that one fee for everything on my account. I can pay $20 a month for someone else to monitor my home and have fire and carbon monoxide monitoring with it so when I decide to self monitor an you want me to pay for your services then I need to be able for all of my cameras to be included in your subscription fees. If you want to change that and keep it at the same price then maybe I might pay and buy more cameras so I can self monitor but until then thanks for nothing but wasting my time and money. I don’t want to buy extra products to make something work unless it is gonna do what I need it to do and that’s to record as I watch it live. I am beyond pissed at the service for these cameras. I thought I was buying something that was gonna work the way I wanted it to especially when buying a camera that’s way overpriced in the first place and shouldn’t be more than $10 to begin with since they constantly move on their own when sitting in an area no one goes near because the cord is heavier than the camera and double sided tape won’t stick good to it to help hold it and even when adding a rubber mat under it or hot glue dots to the bottom it doesn’t help to keep it from moving. All accounts should get the same up to so much storage to record and view and not just old accounts. I’m so disappointed in blink for this and wasting my time and money for something I can no longer use without paying a monthly fee when I bought this for self monitoring like they said I could do but NOPE you can’t.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2021"
53,Joseph William,Worst camera I have,  Of all of the cameras I have inside and outside my house this has got to be one of the worst. It's ridiculous what it chooses to record and what it chooses to just ignore. After checking the recordings from about a week ago I found it's insane how much it ignores actual motion but then picks up the trees blowing in the wind.I have it aiming out my front window since my doorbell camera is on the fritz. We were out on the deck for about 35 miniutes waiting for my friends vehicle to be dropped off so they could get to work. 2 people moving back and forth in front of it constantly. This was about 5:35-5:45 am  until around 6:20-6:30 am. I look back at the recordings so we could see what time exactly it was finally dropped off and there's nothing picked up from 5am until after 10am. This is one of the busiest times on the street I live on. It should have been constantly being set off and recording.  Since other times it picks up most of he cars that pass on the street.Bad enough it typically records then shuts off missing the things it should pick up. Or starts too late to pick up the important parts it should be recording. Part of the reason I can't use it for indoors when I'm selling items. It didn't pick up anything useful and only got useless parts of any interaction. It wasn't useful for watching for shoplifting when my back is turned or anything else. Now this.Then there's the lousy 20 to 30 second recording times. Will never understand how this is useful for any security cameras. What good is 30 seconds. So why bother.These don't have any type of decent live record or live watch on them unless you keep hitting continue. Half the time it takes about 2 miniutes to get the live view to even open. So that's no good for security at all.The only redeeming quality is the picture isn't horrible as long as the light is just right.I'm just hoping the wifi recieved on it is really good cuz only places left for it are upstairs where no one is much these days or the garage to keep an eye out for squirrels getting in there. After that it can go in the trash if it doesn't work there cuz I'll have no use for it at all.Unimpressed and rather unhappy with the blink cameras and won't buy another ever again.

After a week of back-n-forth emails to Blink customer service, received this email(this is where the Misleading Marketing came in to play unbeknownst to me):As your account was created on 10/17/20 and you have the Mini cameras, you do not have the 7200 seconds of free cloud storage.Accounts that were created on or before April 15, 2020 continue to have the original 7200 seconds per Sync Module of basic cloud storage.Local Storage is a free storage option that can be used with a Sync Module 2 and USB drive (up to 256 GB) to store recorded motion clips locally, without use of the Blink Cloud. Live view clips will not have the ability to be saved when using Local Storage only. Storage is limited by the size and amount of space available on the USB drive. Any clips recorded by your cameras attached to the Sync Module 2 will be written directly to the USB drive once they are recorded. These clips can also be viewed in the Blink application.If you chose not to purchase a Subscription or use Local Storage, the cameras will still have the ability to detect motion and send you notifications, but clips will not be stored in the Blink application.

56,Jess M,"Small, affordable, utilitarian.","  I've only had this product for a day and purchased it to use as a baby monitor of sorts. It has relieved a lot of my anxiety, as we try to work around the house while my baby is asleep and I've always been concerned that she will wake and I wont hear or if she's napped longer than usual I'm concerned something is wrong. I can zoom with this camera and watch closely and even see her breathe! I have motion areas to the edge of the crib where she stands when she wakes up and it works perfectly to alert me when she's gotten up. I can check on her from work while I'm working the night shift, or when I first get home. It's the best middle of the road for me short of spending 100s to get a fancy baby video monitor.Pros:-Excellent video resolution.-Easy to use app.-Ability to pinch zoom in app.-Push to talk 2way audio is clear.-Lag appears to be minimal (and I do not have ""reccomended"" upload speeds).Cons:-Live view is not continuous, it will time out after 5 minutes or so and you have to keep clicking ""continue"" about every minute.-There is no web viewer (official) it's app only, which is frustrating.-There is no way to locally view (when app and camera are on same network) so it has to process to the internet (I've not tested load because I want it and don't really care at this point, I have not noticed increased problems but I rarely upload and it is only one camera - without great upload speeds I think I would consider a different option for full house cameras unless they added the local viewing feature which may come somewhat with the sync²).Neutral:-Motion sensing seems to be a bit hit or miss. Need more time to tweak however.-When I have it disarmed it randomly records some of my live views (even though I have it ticked to discard).-I wish I could take a still shot and save it easily.-I wish while in live view I could start and stop a recording instead of just saving the whole live view session.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2020"
57,Amazon Customer,Frustrating & Unreliable - Not Reliable for Home Security or Critical Applications,"  Update Sept. 4, 2020================I was able to improve the night vision of my Blink Mini at the expense of decreased motion detection reliability during the day. However, I am lowering my rating from a 3 star to a 1 star due to reliability issues with the Blink ecosystem.Several days after further adjusting my settings in an attempt to improve the night vision, my Blink Mini stopped responding altogether. When I went to my APP I noticed that I had been logged out by the app for no apparent reason. I tried logging in several times, but each I was informed by the APP that my credentials were incorrect - they were not! I decided to go the simple route of resetting my password which I thought would resolve the problem - IT DID NOT! Blink sends you a pin that you need to enter to reset your password, it also pretty much wipes all your previous settings according to the notice I received. When I attempted to log into my account with the new password, the app again stated that my credentials were incorrect and would not allow me to log into my account. So I tried again, but still no luck. At this point I was becoming very frustrated that a device that was supposed to be providing security was actually making me less secure. I went to the BLINK website to try and contact technical support. It appears that the only way to do this is to fill out a ticket and wait for them to get back to you.At this point, I have to state that this is the worse security device that I have. It may be cheap, but without any reliability - it is completely worthless. While more costly, I would recommend a RING or ARLO camera instead. I have both RING and ARLO products and both have proven extremely reliable.Original Review============The Blink Mini has a lot of potential in my opinion and overall I like it, but it is not at all reliable in my current (and some would argue not intended for) application. Based on my experiences so far, I would not recommend as a primary source for Home Security. However, the Blink Mini might be a satisfactory or even a great fit in your particular application especially if you use it to augment a more reliable system you already have in place. My review is based on a specific application. It could be that I just need to find the right combination of settings to get it to work for my application. The BLINK APP does offer a fairly nice set of Camera Settings to allow you to customize your camera.I have had the Blink Mini operational for several weeks now. I have it placed inside a window observing activity on one of the entryways into my home. During the day it works really well. However, I find that I typically need to perform a soft reset each day as it seems to go into a sleep mode during the night effectivity becoming non-operational.  I have used a different security camera/motion detector alongside the Blink Mini and it doesn't exhibit the same issues. I may end up repurposing my BLINK MINI for garage duty and swap it with the camera I currently have installed there. I am sure garage duty would be much less demanding for the BLINK MINI’s capabilities.It will work really well in detection and recording during the day and then as it gets dark it seems it enter a state where I either get a completely black screen or a reflection from the window and it effectively puts itself into a USELESS mode until I activate some type of video activity using the BLINK APP.I have had the Blink Mini NIGHT VISION setting on AUTO (which is apparently the default). I tried setting the IR setting to ON to determine if there is any improvements. Having the NIGHT VISION set to ON during the day disables color and results in poor video quality due to window reflection. I have turned NIGHT VISION to OFF and IR Intensity to LOW to see if this results in any improvementNOTES: (1) Turning NIGHT VISION to OFF effectively turns motion detection and video recording off unless there's an external light source. (2) The APP doesn’t allow one to turn IR Intensity to OFF. You can only set to LOW - MED - HIGH. It would be nice if you could turn off completely.CONS:1 - Extremely poor or no night vision or motion detection in my application. It's possible that this can be improved by the right set of camera setting - I am experimenting and will update if things improve.2 - Consistently goes into a SLEEP/Non-operational mode at night requiring a soft RESET the next day to make it operational for day activity.3 - Sometimes unable to connect through the cloud to an Eco Show at a different location - this is random and can usually be cleared by activating the BLINK APP. While not ideal, it does seem to clear the problem.4 - Detection notification is noticeably delayed.5 - While new owners get a free cloud subscription until December 31st, 2020; post that date requires you to pay $3/month per camera or purchase a yet-to-be-released Sync Module.6 - Requires that you plug into an electrical outlet (I would say that this is a SOFT CON and possibly a PRO for some depending on your particular situation).7 - IR Intensity cannot be turned OFF.PROS:1 - Good day-time video quality for the price.2 - Good for non-critical monitoring and detection.3 - Nice low-cost augmentation to existing and primary security system.4 - Easy to setup.5 - BLINK APP offer a nice set of Camera Settings to allow you to customize your camera. One caveat is that you cannot turn IR Intensity to OFF which is an issue in some applications.6 - Good day-time motion detection quality.7 - Well made for the relatively low price.In summary, I would say that the BLINK MINI is a decent and even good product depending on your particular application. It’s especially good if you’re augmenting an existing security system for a non-critical application or area. However, I cannot recommend for primary Home Security or Critical Applications at this time.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2020"
58,Nonsha,Failure of a security camera,"  Well, it seemed great at first. I've stuck it on a windowsill to monitor my backyard and the picture is clear and the live view is great.The neighbor's dogs started going crazy (which is really every 5 minutes so can't rely on them) and I had video clips saved in the app, but no notification. I'm not sure what that's about. When I was testing the camera out and moving it around on the sill I was constantly getting notifications. When I went to click on the first clip, a notification popped up saying it failed to load and then deleted the clip. So there was movement outside and the camera picked up on it. Great! But then the clip didn't load correctly and the clip got deleted. Not great. I really want to like this product, but there's already some hiccups on day one. I'll test it for a week and see how it goes, otherwise I'm returning it.Update 12/26I left the camera in the living room to track front door traffic and it caught me leaving and then didn't catch me coming back in and moving about my living room. Not a great security camera if it doesn't even turn on when and record when there's motion right in front of it. Returning and I will look for a better security camera from another company.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2020"
59,Todd,Product is better than the app. What happened Amazon?! - Revised,"  Update:I currently have 6 mini's in use and Blink contacted me after reading my review and have been very responsive to my questions so I am updating.  The flip image was corrected by using different mounting holes on the Mini.  While not as easy I do believe the mounting is more versatile than Wyze and in my situations they worked.  They can't turn of the IR Filters b/c those are used for motion and they understand that consumers want the live feeds.  They also gave me a tip on how to fix scheduling.  There are still some shortcomings but if you have patience you can work around it but I think that is where the app still falls short of its main competitor Wyze.  Blink has more choices and options in their lineup which I do prefer at this time.  And the camera itself I feel is higher quality than Wyze.  If they can fix the live feeds and keep their products affordable to their competition this will go up to 5 stars.As others have written here I have used other security cameras with a much more versatile app.  The camera itself appears to be higher quality (i can see from the live feeds and audio quality) than the application can utilize and Blink definitely rushed this into production.  Its unforgivable that you would have a product launched and you are not able to view multiple live feeds from your cameras simultaneously.  I'm also disappointed you can't control the IR filters (turn off if shooting through an interior window facing outside), or rotate the images 180 if your mounting the camera upside down.  Also the scheduling for arming the cameras should allow you to select them individually rather than applying to your entire grouped system. I have a competitor camera that is lowered priced with magnetic mounts that I find more versatile in certain applications as well. I would also hope they add google home controls in the future.  Which comes down to my last point.  I have bought these with the faith that its Amazon owned and supported and expect these features to appear as they update and refine the app.  At that point I will revise the review.  Currently its difficult to give a higher review with competitors offering more for less.  Come on Amazon!!",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2020"
60,Charlene & Jerry,So close with a major flaw,"  Compared to our current Amcrest the standard image quality of this camera was good. Not as good as the Amcrest and it blows out the sunlight coming in windows but it’s definitely acceptable.As for the night mode it was garbage compared to the Amcrest. As you can see in the picture it has some sort of haze in the middle of the image (no, the protective label wasn’t still on it) and even ignoring the haze the image quality is poor. You definitely couldn’t use the picture to identify someone.But the biggest disappointment that they don’t mention is that you can’t unlimited live view these cameras. You can view it for 5-30 second increments but you need to keep selecting the camera to view again, and you can only view for five minutes per session. That’s worthless. I understand with the battery ones that you’d drain the batteries quickly live viewing but one should have the choice. With this flaw we’ll be sticking with the Amcrest where I can have it pulled up on a screen all day long without needing to refresh every 30 seconds.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 23, 2020"
61,Ms Tony T,"Extremely deceiving ""free cloud storage""","  When I purchased the first camera, it was free cloud storage which prompted me to order 4 more of these throughout 2020. I was mostly satisfied with the cameras other than cutting out for hours on end during the day. I am mostly concerned with night security so this did not stop me from using them. I waited patiently for the blink sync 2 module and after receiving it was thoroughly satisfied with my system. Picture quality and motion detection were good for the price point.Now after the ""new"" subscription policy I am completely disappointed with how they updated the free storage that I was promised.

62,K Ivey,"""Continue?"" - I'm sorry for Amazon...","  I was looking for a camera to monitor my 3D printer and naturally, because I enjoy my Echo devices, I was drawn to Blink as it is part of that ecosystem and so far I have really enjoyed Amazon products such as Alexa devices and AmazonBasics. The Blink camera is a massive disappointment, and I think I know exactly why it is the way that it is. The camera's feed can only be viewed for 30 seconds at a time, after which a popup button appears and asks you ""Continue?"" and in order to keep viewing the feed, you must press that otherwise the camera feed disconnects until you press the play button again. Amazon claims that it's to ""conserve bandwidth"" and I don't buy it. Right off the bat the app sets you up with a ""free"" 30 day trial. I say free in quotes because it's just another trial that must be canceled before it ends otherwise it just continues and charges you. Now, the app does tell you in very clear and easy to understand menus that you are going to be charged unless you cancel, but it is also a subscription that ends the moment you cancel it, as opposed to simply disabling automatic renewal but still letting you use the remainder of the trial. Here's the nail in the coffin, Amazon also states that ""Alexa enabled screen devices do not provide the Continue button and remain in Live View until the limit is reached."" The Blink camera isn't trying to be an affordable wifi camera. It's primary purpose is to sell you a subscription and convince you to buy an Alexa-enabled Echo Show, as that device doesn't ""provide the Continue button.""So, I'm writing this review as I am just now setting up my Wyze camera. I'm sending my Blink camera back to Amazon and I doubt they'll look at these reviews that expose their ulterior motives, but all I can say is that I'm sorry for them. They just lost another customer for their anti-consumer approach. You can't convince me that Amazon needs to save money by conserving bandwidth. Amazon is the 3rd richest company in the world. Amazon, you tell me why you have to save bandwidth by making an annoying popup that you can't disable, while Wyze, a company significantly smaller than you, is offering 14 DAY FREE cloud storage for both events and continuous recording, with the option to use an SD card for storage. That's the reality of this camera. One last time, Amazon, I am wholeheartedly disappointed in and sorry for you. Do better.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2021"
63,Bob,Disappointed For Sure and I Really Don't Need Another Subscription,"  I am a long time Amazon Cloud Cam user.  Cloud cams allow you to watch the feed live and keep it on as long as you want.  I wanted a cheap camera to point toward my driveway so when I am in my windowless basement working I could keep delivery drivers safe from my dogs.  This indoor Blink camera popped as a deal and I thought it would be a great replacement for a cheap no name brand camera I was using.  I was wrong, there is no way to keep the live feed up for longer than 30 seconds.  The cheap Teckin camera as well as my Amazon cloud cams allow this.I am also very disappointed that Blink does not provide some basic clip retention without a subscription.  I canceled the basic subscription because I do not need want another bill.  Now I receive alerts basically taunting me telling me something happened but there is no way to view the clips.  Again, Amazon Cloud Cam retains at least 24 hours worth of clips for free.  I'm not interested in yet another subscription.  So now I have this camera which is essentially useless unless I want to point it at maybe my kids play area and when I hear screaming I can check the live feed... for only 30 seconds at a time.

64,L.Johnson,TRASH!! Don’t Purchase... MINUS 5 Stars,"  Update... It seems that these cameras have gone from bed bad to horrible. Camera in one room kept hover off over and over for approximately 30 plus times yet NO ONE Ws in the room. Today there was HIGH ACTIVITY IN BOTH ROOMS WHERE MY TWO CAMERAS ARE LOCATED... not one camera detect any motion for hours. Last night it did not detect motion when there was motion yet went off when no motion. Return/ exchange time has passed a few days ago. So I am stuck with this trash. I waited thinking an update would be in place to repair bugs because I was not dealing with one camera so unless both are defective which is not probable, they are just TRASH. Returns during holidays need to be extended on ANY and EVERY PURCHASE. Got stuck with several things causing lost of hard earned money. It seems as if the camera(s) record when they want to.... not when they should or when you really need to go back and view to see what happened. Every time I want to watch something that has happened it’s not caught in camera. It records then stops to reset during what I need to look back on. Last night there was several hours of no motion detection during high activity time. One camera shows son walking toward camera yet second camera did not detect anything in the other room he entered. At one point when it did detect pictures are clear then suddenly you barely see video. Cameras firmware just updated so I will see how the motion recording goes today/this evening. If it’s better I will update if not I will look to replace. Both cameras use to make a loud noise (click) when they would start recording which they no longer do. Glad not to hear the clicking but I need these to record. I would keep because I purchased them both with a bundle deal. Good for live viewing from a different room but not when you need to know what HAS ALREADY HAPPENED or when you’re home. When it doesn’t capture a pet I was disappointed but when it fails to capture a person then something is definitely wrong. Keep in mind I have two cameras with exact issues, which lead me to believe it is the quality of the camera and not a defective camera. Will purchase something better for the two important rooms and move these to area I was only considering and use for live view. (BLINK THANKS FOR THE ECTRA EXPENSE) Extremely disappointed. I don’t like doing returns and hate doing exchanges because I find those more complicated but don’t have a choice at this point. Not worth having two useless cameras. Although I am sure I stated I use them for live viewing that also fails very often. When you hear a noise and need to see what is happening you need a reliable camera that will start fairly quickly. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Now I understand why they added them to a bundle deal only way to get rid of stock.

   I use this in my window (even though it doesn't recommend) I took off the night view and because I have light poles and buisness that leave lights on I can still view outside perfectly at night. If I have it set to enabled activity and even take a picture to set the boundaries when it detects. It will still detect every car or person who will walk by. I have also used it in my kitchen and the night vision was amazing! I love that I can view it on my newest Alexa smart device (newest 2021 release) and my echo show 5. This was very easy to set up and very easy to unplug and move to fit your needs. However you can only view one screen so if someone is viewing you can not.

Picture clarity:  Lorex 1st, Arlo Pro 2nd and Blink Mini in 3rd.  (Not much difference between Arlo Pro and Blink Mini) Motion Detection:  Arlo Pro 1st, Lorex 2nd, Blink Mini... Nothing! Does not function well at all.Smart Intergation:  Arlo 1st, Blink Mini 2nd and Lorex 3rd.  (Lorex constantly falls short here!)  Cost:  Blink Mini @ $35 per camera... Hands Down!When home, I prefer the quality of the Lorex system.  When remote or on Smart devises, Lorex falls short.Blink Mini is fabulous on your Smart Device with the exception of your PC.Arlo is also great... but Blink is much faster/quicker.I purchased this Blink Mini to monitor my mother who lives with me and has Dementia.The cost of this device coupled with the ease of use is Fantastic.  Still, I wish it would detect motion reasonably and this camera falls way short of that.  That being said, I may purchase one more Blink Mini to use to monitor my mother is one additional room.  I could purchase an additional Arlo Pro camera to do both rooms, but the expense is just too much.Update: 8/3/2020Blink reached out to me several times via email. After providing them with more details they reached back out and conveyed that the product should be working and that I likely have it positioned wrong. I had to politely ask them to stop bullying me on this subject. Setting up these cameras is not rocket science.

These are easy to implement now there's no battery life concern.And finally, why no 24/7 recording? I realize there are 'workarounds' for this, but now that again, there's no battery to worry about I would like a continuous recording option.

71,Steven,Take it from a owner of two different camera systems,"  So i now have had the pleasure with working with Amazon's Blink system (both XT2 and Mini) and the Zosi camera system.Motion detection range: I found the Mini camera to be about 15ft, in daytime in the house, which is not bad for a typical size room in a house. Some, may desire more distance to cover a length including a hallway, but this camera is not really intended for that. Furthermore, an issue with DVR system's motion detection, I found, is that it won't start recording until about 1-4 seconds AFTER the motion came into camera view. This reason, I speculate, is for the HDD to spin up. Possible SSD to remedy? Then it gets expensive for a high cap SSD. Whereas the Mini will begin recording about 1-2 sec BEFORE the motion comes into view. That's awesome.  (Of course I can turn Zosi to record 24/7.)Quality of video:  It's comparative, really, depending on setting. Both cameras are up to 1080p. Some other camera system may let you adjust based on FPS (10-30); Blink lets you simply choose from Best, Standard, and Saver. So video quality is dependant.Sound: Mini has great sound recording. And it speaks out! The speaking out part is not common with 24/7 DVR camera systems. I have dogs. This is a feature I never utilized but I quickly miss--I gave this system to my tenant in my rental property to install and use.For me, I needed longer range--compared to Blink XT2 outdoor camera--outside to cover my property, and 24/7 recording works for that.Value: I think this single Mini camera is a great value. I got two of them, for $34.99 and later $29.99 on sale. This camera does not include the actual Blink hub unit for it to work.Ease of install: Very easy. The app has straightforward instructions. All you do is plug it in and scan the QR code to install. I would recommend this for many, mostly due to ease of install.

My biggest problem with these camera's as with all the indoor camera's I bought is the local storage. In the description it says ""local storage with Sync Module 2 and USB"". I don't have an issue with having to buy their USB to use instead of just a regular USB but the statement is really deceptive. You can only local store if you have a subscription plan, so why have the USB? And it's $3 dollars a month per camera!! But the outdoor camera's do not have to have the subscription plan to locally store video?!? Why have one camera that can store video without a subscription plan and another, that uses the exact same sync module by the way, needing a subscription to store video.Also setting up the local storage is mystifying at best. You can read that all you need is a USB and you can set it up but when you put the USB into the sync device nothing happens, it does not see the USB so you still do not have any kind of storage.Very disappointed with the whole video storage on this product and with Blink also!!",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2021"
77,Mark P Dahmer,Just not a good design.  How are there so many good reviews?,"  I am not sure if people reviewing these have never used a functional security camera or they just got a better product than me.  But I have four Blink cams.  Two outdoor, and two indoor.  The outdoor are somewhat useful, for things like seeing the delivery drivers and probably depending on angle could catch an intruder.  But as noted in MANY reviews, the fact that it only catches a maximum of 30 seconds is completely not useful for almost anything, and the live steam doesn't stay live unless you push the continue button.  So for me, trying to see my cat's activities or even for many deliveries, it really isn't useful.  I have fioptic internet w/ extremely high speed router, it's not my network.  Most of the outdoor activity is ""OK"" but there is definitely a lag with live views, and I have had it completely fail to catch motion as well (a delivery was made, but there is no video of it).  It's set on high sensitivity, but that doesn't seem to matter.  The indoor is almost useless, because of the 30 second limitation, I can't really monitor much.  I wanted to be able to check on my cat's eating and the pet sitter, etc, but it 1) doesn't catch it at the beginning and 2) doesn't have a long enough clip.  It's just pretty much wasted money for the inside ones.  The outside I think are probably somewhat useful, but I would not be at all surprised if I had something happened and Blink either missed it entirely or just caught the end of it.  And, it can only apparently record one camera at a time, so if something is happening in back and front of house, I'm out of luck.  Overall just a disappointment.  Will be replacing soon.  I've used the YI cameras and they are much better at recording and catching things from start to finish, but they have other drawbacks.

The night vision works really well. My only issue...I am unsure why/how the camera stopped working. When I log into the app and try for the camera or live recording view, the app would display the loading icon for a WHILE before informing me the action failed. I submitted a ticket on 02/06/2021 with no luck. I called 03/23/2021 after a month of trying to troubleshoot on my own and was left with p*ss poor customer service.

I was unsure of how that would be when there ZERO issues before the camera defects. I still contacted my internet provider who told me the information I was given was incorrect and would not solve the issue of the CAMERA ITSELF. I called back to relay this information now to Ryan who wanted to me 1. reset my router (already done), 2. move my camera (already done), 3. reset the camera (already done multiple times), 4. delete the camera from the app and reinstall (done multiple times), 5. delete the app itself AND 6. check the speed of the internet on a website.

Hardware wise, they are almost the exact same size, and have about the same capabilities. Unfortunately, the blink software is not as nice as the cloud camera software. With the discontinued cloud camera you could set the camera to turn on automatically when your were away from home (sensed by your phone location) and turn off when you got home. With blink it looks like you can only use a predefined schedule. Hopefully they will add this feature in the future. Both systems can only be accessed with a phone app (no way to connect via a computer). I'm confused why they have this limitation.With the mini, like other Blink Cameras, you are limited to short clips, with mandatory breaks between consecutive clips. This can be extremely frustrating, but apparently is par the course in low end security camera systems.With this camera so cheap, I feel it is hard to complain too much (it is an amazing bang for the buck), but it still feels like a bit of a downgrade after using the similarly priced cloud camera system.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2020"
80,S. J. Jensen,Not a good product without the subscription.,"  Bought the Sync Module 2 so that I wouldn't have to pay for a subscription. It will record only 30 seconds maximum at a time and the only way it saves video is if it detects motion. After the video is recorded, it will send a notification to your phone (I haven't been able to find a way that I can easily access my cameras via my computer, only the app on my phone. It may be accessable via PC but if so, it's not easy to find). If you select the notification and open the app, it will show you a Live Video. You cannot save Live Video without a subscription.  So let's say that someone breaks into my house and is there for a half hour. In order to have a recording of the crime, I have to watch 60 separate video clips that have been saved to my phone. Instead of getting a notification that someone is currently in my house and logging into the app and watching/recording it happen, I have to pray that nothing happens within the minimum 10 seconds that this system takes between clip recordings. Think about that, someone walks in and gets recorded for 30 seconds MAXIMUM and then does not get recorded for 10 seconds MINIMUM before getting recorded for another 30 seconds. There's no reason to give this system that handicap, all they want to do is screw the customer and keep you paying for the holy grail that is subscriptions. Furthermore; they of course outsourced customer support which results in choppy phone calls where the line cuts out for 5-10 seconds randomly.  Why give the video clips a time limit at all if I'm OK with filling up my storage with potentially useless footage? Why have a cap on the USB storage size I plug into the Sync Module? Why isn't there a program I can run on my PC to access and edit video? Why does my system get kneecapped if I shell out for the expensive ""storage"" system instead of paying for a subscription?  I have attached two screeshots from the app that highlight my complaints.  I'm sending my cameras and Sync Module 2 back immediately.

83,Eli D. Lee,Not for security,"  I wanted to add security cameras to my apartment, but I didn't want to spend a big buck and also pay for cloud storage, so Blink backed up by Amazon seemed a good option.  I bought the two wireless camera bundle first, and I had a break in, and the cameras never detected anything, and I live in a 600 sqft apartment (1 bdr, 1 Bath), so I thought maybe the motion detectors only go this far, and my apartment, even tiny, was too large, so I bought this wireless camera, pointing right to the front door (12 ft away), and I did some test. This camera never detects motions, only after you are more than 30 seconds moving into its coverage area, it is not like right away will detect something moving, and even the wireless cameras will pick movement, before this camera even notices.  Blink overall is a cheap option to watch on demand what is happening in your house, if you want security, spend more money",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2021"
84,KUJayhawk,Updated Review: Problem with Motion Detect Remedied (From 2 Stars to 4 Stars),"                    The media could not be loaded.
                




   Updated (4 Star) Review (Original Review Below):After posting my dissatisfaction with the motion detection regarding these cameras, a Blink tech support representative reached out to me to help me resolve the issues. First off, part of the problem was user error, in that I set these Blink Minis up right after I setup the Ring doorbell camera and spotlight camera. The UI within the Blink app is designed in a way, in terms of motion detect zones, is opposite to Ring's app in that the shaded portions in Blink are inactive zones (not to trigger an alert & record), whereas in Ring, anything you draw as shaded is to be detected as a zone. I made the mistake in not reading the instructions carefully within the Blink app as the text just blends right in to everything else. I partially blame the developers for not making that piece of information standout or for making it the opposite to their sister company, Ring's app. I feel that this should be updated to be the same as Ring or make the instructions pop out and highlighted so it's easy to see! I attached a screenshot of the Blink motion zones versus the Ring's motion zone screen. Quite the opposite if you're like me and speed through the setup thinking they're the same. Anyways, I removed the shaded squares and the motion triggers started working again!As for the other issue. These Blink mini cams are not made to be placed behind a window, the IR light which renders these useless as the glare reflection on the glass window makes these useless. Fortunately there's some workarounds that make it work to an acceptable degree in my opinion. Besides, I use the Ring cams as my main security cams, and these Blink minis are supplemental to them. Anyways, there's an option in the app to turn off the IR. It's important to note that they are somewhat capable of motion detection through glass, since they use pixel difference analysis instead of IR heat signature. This can only work under very limited conditions such as when daylight is present, with the camera positioned as close as possible to a window, and with the recording LED and IR LED disabled to reduce reflection. I did all of those things and I added a Mr. Beams motion activated spotlight over the top. So during the day no problems, but at night it's complete pitch black until the spotlight is activated which in turns triggers the alert and subsequent recording on Blink. I uploaded a video demonstrating that. It was completely dark and the only illumination on the night recording footage is from the Mr. Beams. The solution and workaround worked in my case.With all that said, for the price point, these Blink Mini Cams are a good value with decent picture quality. I still find my Ring cameras to be superior in every way, but they are also significantly more expensive. I wish that these Blink mini cams would just record to the Ring Protect Plus subscription, which includes unlimited cameras and cloud storage. But since they don't, the best solution instead of spending per device with Blink's cloud storage (which should be one flat rate like Ring) is to get the Sync Module 2, which will allow you to record on a flash storage device for the footage to be reviewed within the app. Overall, after fixing my motion detection issues with the Blink, I'm now happy with them and would recommend them for the price. If you have the extra money, go for something more refined and advance such as the Ring cameras.Original (2 Star) Review:Both my blink minis are hit or miss (mostly miss) when it comes to motion alerts and recordings. Just got them a month ago and if they weren't so cheap bundled with the echo shows I bought, I'd send them back. My ring cameras are on point, but these blink cams are disappointing to say the least. And yes, I've armed and disarmed them several times, and still the same. I could be jumping right in front of them, day or night, and they still don't detect motion. They need a firmware update or something because they're not that good. The video is not bad for the price of these, but not stellar by any means. The app looks like it can use an update in the UI department, it looks and operates significantly interior to the ring app I use, can't believe Amazon owns both companies and can't allocate a little more resources to polish up the app and the firmware to get this system functioning somewhat on par to their ring products.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2020"

86,JPDillon,Echo compatible?  Not 100% true. UPDATED: No Notifications & Blink now charging $$$,"  ****** UPDATE PLEASE READ:  After having the Echo Show 5 and Blink Mini camera working perfectly as a puppy monitor, it basically quit working. Let me explain. I used the Show/Blink setup to notify me when my puppy would wake up at night so we could let her out to do her business.  It worked well (almost too well) by sending Alexa notifications to both my iPhone and the Echo Show.  I eventually turned the notifications off on my phone because I didn't need two things waking me up at 3am.  Again it worked for a while, then just out of the blue, it stopped notifying me through Echo Show.  I tried everything to  get it working again, but I was forced to start using my iPhone notifications instead.  Echo Show would still let me view the camera ""Echo show me Bella"", but no notifications when she would move.  Echo Show became almost useless since I can also  view the camera from my phone (and also speak to my pup which Show never could do).  Mind you, it has been taking 30 second video clips and storing them on my phone.  I got a couple that were YT worthy for their entertainment value (search Bella the Corgi).I put up with the notification issue until BLINK PULLED A FAST ONE ON ME!!!  A little over a month ago, I got a notification on my phone that my ""30 Day Premium Blink Trial"" had begun.  I did not sign up for the trial, so I thought nothing of it.  The other day my trial expired.  I went into my phone to look at the stored videos and now they all are LOCKED!!!  When I click on them Blink app tells me I need to subscribe to their service!!!! WHAT??!!!!??Now the Echo Show and Blink Mini are all but USELESS to me except to notify me on my phone when my puppy moves at night.  Echo Show's notifications are gone, and NOW Blink will not record.  The whole point of the security camera is to record!!  If I were to point my camera at my mail box to catch mail thieves, it would be absolutely WORTHLESS now since I'd have to be at the ready to view it live.  Anything not live is locked up and held for ransom by Blink.Amazon (who also owns Blink) is getting greedier by the day.  Shame on you for taking away the basic functionalities that I bought it for in the first place!******************Using the blink app on iOS you can use the ""Talk"" button to talk through the camera, however, this is NOT possible when using Echo show (5"" latest version) that is bundled together with this camera.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 14, 2021"
87,Michael DeSilva,Known Issue Causes Camera to Become Unresponsive and Not Sense Motion with IR,"  I was excited about this camera and it worked as advertised for about a week. Then one morning I came into my office and it didn't alert upon me entering. I couldn't get it to trigger with motion no matter what I did. This continued more days than not. If I opened the app and did a live view, it would ""wake up"" and work, but any time the IR turned on in the dark, it would subsequently not turn off as it should, so once there was light again, the screen could not sense motion because the IR was stuck on (IR + light = white screen).Upon contacting support (after many other unrelated troubleshooting steps), they informed me ""the issue you are experiencing is the known issue about blink mini where it doesn't detect motion and displays red"" and ""we are still working to get this fixed because the way this camera is designed is the reason why this known issue is created. Basically, this happens when there are rapid light changes in front of the camera, especially in the garage, when you open the door or turn on the light, these can cause the IR filter to get stuck, and the motion won't work unless you issue a command.""I can say from my experience that the issue is not limited to rapid light changes. I have a window in my office, and every night when it gets dark, the IR comes on. Then, when the sun rises, the IR refuses to turn off and the camera gets stuck. I can ""issue a command"" (basically interact with the camera in any way through the app) to get the camera to work again, but I wanted reliable notifications of motion without having to remember to open the app every day and do a live view some time after sunrise.Support did offer that I could do a scheduled disarm/arm command so this interaction would happen automatically, but scheduling it to arm when it was already armed didn't work, and disarming then arming it would require 15 minutes of downtime between the two commands. While the likelihood of anything being missed during those 15 minutes was very low, I purchased a camera based on the promise of uninterrupted monitoring, which this does not provide. I also have no good way of knowing when to schedule a command like that since I don't know at what point it becomes ""stuck"" as the sun comes up, and that time would change throughout the year and based on weather. Amazon kindly returned it for me outside of the return window (since the return window closed before we got to the ""known issue"" in troubleshooting).If you don't need IR or automatic motion detection after the IR has been triggered and before you interact with the camera, this would probably be a good camera for you. I essentially wanted a security camera in an office during the day and night, and while this was advertised as that, it isn't until they fix this issue.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2021"
88,Ehfaafzv,Awesome Video Camera; But Set-Up?,"  The Blink Mini video camera is awesome for what it does, once you set it up.  The common issue is that it takes slightly more effort to establish an account with Blink and activate the camera.  However, once set-up, the camera can be used with either available light or with night vision.Either way, the Blink Mini can detect motion within the scope of the camera's range.  The Blink Mini is useful for monitoring home interiors, or areas which might require protection against unauthorized access.The Blink Mini can capture about 10 seconds of video, enough to identify intruders.  The Blink Mini will also send push notifications to your mobile device to alert you to unauthorized access.Not only will this save your cherished goods, money, and insurance replacement costs, it will help law enforcement do its job against thieves.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 12, 2021"
89,Ehfaafzv,Camera becomes useless after 2 months,"  The camera goes to sleep and disarms itself every night.The blink camera won't integrate with the echoshow seemlessly at all.

So you go to use it, and it could be an emergency!!! You might really need that camera to be there, but it's more important for Amazon to extort a phone number from you and they make it impossible for to sign into the app without giving them a phone number.So two months, and i have a useless device....

They promise you privacy, the promise from a bad person or company is worth exactly zero.When they extort a phone number by locking you out of the app... They are capable of anything.

   The major issues are the annoying loud clicking sound it makes when the camera records. I turned off the IR function as people have suggested (which I shouldn’t have to) and it doesn’t help. The software is also very glitchy at times. You also can’t watch any of the Blink camera live without constantly clicking the continue button or they time out. The picture quality is decent and I like that you can talk through the camera but that doesn’t make up for the other annoyances.

91,DesignCinci,It works well for my needs.,"  First, I did not need the security camera for anything other than being an inside device that would motion trigger if a burglar gained access to the inside of the house while I was away. It seems to serve that purpose well.  I especially like the ease of Arming and Disarming thru the app.  Basically, the first page that pops up. The set-up is pretty much plug and play with the exception that it took a bit longer to recognize my Wi-Fi than I would have thought.  I needed to do that step a couple of times. I found the motion sensing sensitivity to be good. Out of the box, and set out on my deck as a test, it alerted to wind moved trees at about 50 ft. The sensitivity and field of vision is adjustable with the app. Despite some negative review comments about the picture quality, I have to say I was impressed with mine. I did not expect that quality for a $35 camera.In deciding to buy or not, I would suggest reading the 3 star reviews and get all of the info, pro and con, that is needed to make a decision as to this being the right camera for your particular need.There was one absurdly frustrating negative.  The instructions say to scan the QR Code. Guess what?  The flap of the box it came in has a QR code, but that is not the one that works. The one that works is on the back of the camera and is about the size of a pencil eraser which lead to a couple attempts to steady my cell long enough for it to register the code. Ultimately not a big deal, but I do not like to be told to go left when I should go right. That cost Blink one star.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2020"

   These are the first ""security cameras"" I've had that does not have long recording. Actually you have to sit there in live feed and record and hit continue every 10-20 seconds if you want to capture something. Otherwise you have to hope whoever breaks into your house shows their face on your camera in the first 10 seconds of movement, if the camera catches the movement at all. The programming is weird. It will pick up tiny bugs flying around ornmoving shadows more often then it picks up my cats and I have 3 and a large tortoise. The picture quality is nice, but without continuous recording it's worthless for me.

They explained that the motion technology is different from the XT2 vs the Mini and that my issue was either with firmware or hardware.  The support tech pushed a firmware update and I tested again. Still the same issue. They are now sending a replacement blink mini. Fingers crossed I had a defective device.  I am adding a star for the great customer service in trying to fix my issue.

Great customizable features such as motion sensitivity, scheduling, IR levels, indicator lights on/off etc.  Very easy to set up and sync with your WIFI. Nice looking with a great small form factor.  No need for batteries because it plugs into power.  Some complain that you can't just monitor the image 24/7...well that is not what this camera is for people.  This is a system that is used for motion detection and to check in on a room/location on occasion when you want to see it.Now for the bad!  #1 is major, and the main reason I cannot recommend this system. When going from dark to light, as in going from a dark garage at night time to turning the lights on, the infrared system cannot adapt and remains on thereby preventing the motion detector from activating.  Major, major flaw - Blink is aware of the problem and is supposedly working on a fix.  #2 is that there is no internal SD card storage, and the free cloud storage goes away starting in 2021.  We will be forced to either buy a stand-alone Sync module with a SD card, or purchase a cloud subscription...no bueno!  #3 This is minor, but a pain in the butt none-the-less. The base looks to be magnetic, but is not. The nickel-sized metal object in the base is either not magnetic, or just doesn't stick because it is raised up a bit too high inside the base.  I have mine sitting on a metal cabinet in my garage, and a magnetic base would have been perfect.  I will eventually pickup a small round magnet to stick on my cabinet that the Blink will adhere too just for some extra security/stabilization.

I contacted support through the app they take forever sometimes a whole day to get back to you not only that the phone number they have listed rings and rings and rings and Rings no one ever answers so that is useless. After a lot of back and forth which took a lot of days they had me download an app I sent them the Code this app checks the device, they told me in that conversation but that camera was defected and said they would send me a new one. They never said anything about returning that camera and after thinking I am not going to try to connect with support again I'll just call Amazon because I'm honest and did not want to keep it plus it I told them I wanted to find out how to return it and the woman I spoke with was absolutely wonderful with me. So after having UPS print a label for me she said they would pick it up as long as I had the Box taped up and we could put the label on it and they would take it and bring it back to Amazon I got a receipt to check the tracking it has been returned. Now after all of that support sends me any mail which is how they have been conversing with me to say like a print the label they sent me in the email so I could return it to the support center, I could not print it because my printer is broken and I proceeded to tell them I called Amazon and it was being returned back there. Now mind you blink is connected to Amazon. After a lot of stress from dealing with this I hope I never ever ever have to deal with blink again.

I am really pretty smart when it comes to electronics and I could be wrong but I don't think so I believe it is there app that was the problem because, once more wait for it when the new camera came I thought for the heck of it I'm going to try to connect it just to see if it does the same thing even though I ordered another camera from another company and guess what it will not take the number to connect that device it kept giving me a message that said ""not found and manufacturers table"" meaning it would not take the serial number so it couldn't even be set up , so as they say I'm done.

I want to be able to monitor a live video feed continuously for an indefinite period of time. You cannot do that with this camera and its app. Here is what you will find in the Blink knowledge base if you dig around:""To conserve bandwidth, a Continue? button appears, asking if you want to keep watching the live View. The button appears a few times until your viewing limit of five minutes is reached.Alexa enabled screen devices do not provide the Continue button and remain in Live View until the limit is reached.If the Live View ends before you are finished, merely re-enter Live View by pressing the icon again.""Best case is using an Alexa device where you MERELY have to restart the Live View every 5 minutes, making the Blink camera useless.Worst case is using any other device where you have press Continue every 45 seconds to get 5 minutes of Live View, making the Blink camera ANNOYING and useless.Apparently these cameras were named Blink because if you Blink you'll miss it.

What I liked about the Yi was that I could mount it upside down on my ceiling and then rotate the image in the app. No such luck with Blink. How could they have not thought of that?When I asked their service team they said that it wasn’t something they considered but the camera was designed to swivel to get more angles. That doesn’t help me.Since my problem wasn’t going to be resolved anytime soon I just designed and 3D printed a ceiling mount. I posted the design for free on Thingiverse.

   We adopted a hedgehog in poor condition and we are working on getting him back to normal, so I bought this camera to monitor his activity on his wheel, eating habits, and drinking habits. I bought this camera because it has motion detection and I wanted to get alerts while at work if he got up to eat or drink. As you can see in the video, it has good night vision, but it doesn’t detect him running on his wheel as “motion”. I have it set at the highest sensitivity. I feel like any quality camera would be able to pick that up, even if it is behind the bars of the cage.

Out of three other camera brands, including the cheaper Wyze cam, this had the muddiest picture quality. All in all an unreliable security solution.Update: now that my subscription is ending, I will be buying another security camera with local storage instead of dishing out cash monthly for the Blink. After a year of using this I can confidently say that this camera is not worth the higher cost over the Wyze cam, and it is certainly not worth the monthly premium. Wyze has proved to be more efficient, reliable, and better in picture quality in both day and night modes while also being cheaper and not forcing you to pay for a monthly subscription for video access. The Blink cam as well as the Ring doorbells, all operate under this scam-like premise.

109,Jeff Gardner,What a piece of junk,"  I purchased two of these, thinking that a wired camera would be perfect for monitoring two rooms. Not so much. I finally returned one, and should have returned both, but the second one seemed to work just long enough for the return window to close.Problem 1. Both cameras would often simply disconnect for no reason. I would have to go to the camera, delete it from the app, reset it, and reconnect it in the app. Useless and impossible when I am traveling.Problem 2. The second camera finally simply disconnected one last time, and I was unable to reconnect it at all in the app. I tried at least 15 times. The camera would scan, connect to the app, ask for my Wi-Fi password, and then respond with unable to connect. So now I have a $30 piece of junk, electronic recycling.Problem 3. When the cameras did work, they would often not activate on motion. I could walk up to the camera, wave my hands around, and nothing. Motion alerts useless.Problem 4.

110,Msmojo,The software is lacking to the point these are pretty well worthless,"  Sadly, for the price, the picture quality is excellent.  I was VERY happy with the image quality.  The motion detection, while a nice feature for a budget camera, just doesn't work well.  The problem is in the software.  Either it is WAY too over sensitive, or just doesn't do anything.  I am still trying to get that tweaked to be usable in some way.  The larger issue with the software for me, it just doesn't work well.  Either it won't access the camera, or the ""system is busy"".  Then there is the timeout issue.  Like other reviewers have said, it times out very quickly.  There is a ""continue"" button you can hit, but in my experience so far you hit the button, almost immediately lose the sound, and then a few seconds later you lose the feed entirely anyway.  This has been so frustrating that I can't ever seem to access the feed when I need to that I am just done with these cameras.  I have only had them up a few days, I am hoping I can still find the box to return these useless pieces of junk.  Perhaps a future update will make them useable.  Oh, one last thing, you cannot access the feed, from this time at least, from a PC of any kind unless you want to setup an Android emulator.  That is just idiotic.  I expect that from the questionable cameras/companies with various weird names from China, but not from an Amazon company.  That last fact they proudly make sure you know when you run the software.

113,BrewCityRider,You HAVE to have the subscription plan,"  I wanted this camera and it's the first one I've ever owned for one very simple silly reason. One of my cats has taken to pooping on our carpeted basement floor and I haven't been able to catch the culprit so I thought I'd order this inexpensive camera so I could figure it out. I saw that there was a subscription plan when I ordered, but I just assumed that was for people who wanted to do fancy things and keep their videos for the long term and stuff like that. Little did I know you HAVE to have it. In the app, without understanding this, I said to cancel the 30 day trial thinking I don't need to store videos of my cat pooping. Once I did that, the camera still recorded I guess but it would no longer let me look at the video. If I can't see the video, the camera is of no use whatsoever. Granted the basic plan is only three dollars a month and perhaps I would pay that for security reasons, but I can't see paying $3 month to get a video of my cat pooping.  So if you want to actually use this camera, you HAVE to have at least the basic plan. That wasn't clear when I purchased it.Edit:  I forgot to mention also that before I discovered that the camera is unusable without the subscription plan, I was having constant problems with it dropping my Internet. I just kept seeing that red light and sometimes it would record and sometimes it wouldn't. In two days of owning this I was beyond frustrated. The ironic thing is that the cat did its business at that point in time when the camera had the red light and wasn't recording, so I don't know who did it even now. Thanks Blink.

116,Richard Rost,Pretty Disappointing,"  I bought one Blink camera to try out before replacing all of my Zmodo/Meshare cameras. I'm glad I didn't replace all of them right off the bat. The hardware is elegantly designed and seems well built but the user experience is terrible.For starters the Live View, where you can watch and/or record a real time feed from your camera is really hit or miss. I find it works better when I'm away from home but even then I often get one of an assortment of error messages instead of a feed.Worse, it seems that ""Live View"" is unavailable when the camera is recording based on a motion event. So, you get a motion alert on your phone, open the app to quickly see what's going on but instead it just tells you ""Live View in Progress"" and refuses to give you a live feed. The one moment you really want a live feed you're not *allowed* to have it? There's also a delay before the recordings become available in the app so it's really a frustrating experience.When the Live View does work you have to constantly reply to a ""Continue?"" prompt or the feed will stop after about 30 seconds, so if you wanted to use this to keep an eye on something it's totally useless. Even if you keep pressing the Continue button it will eventually stop the feed after a few minutes at most.Recording of motion events is strictly time-based. You can set the time up to 30 seconds and it will re-trigger afterwards but I much prefer the way most other motion-activated cameras work where they record continuously as long as there's motion. With the Blink you get gaps in the footage that you don't get with other cameras.The picture quality is at best adequate but I was surprised that it's not better. In particular it does poorly if there's a bright light source in the room. It tends to focus on the center of the viewing area so if there's something like a lamp on the edge of the field of view that area is a total, unviewable white out. There's zero adjustment for the video settings other than resolution so there's nothing you can do about this.On the whole based on it being a newer product, a major brand and associated with Amazon I was expecting something far superior to my aging, Chinese brand Zmodo/MeShare cameras but in the end what this product did was make me realize how much I was taking for granted.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2020"
117,Jim Henry,Great camera; missing key features.,"  No continuous live view which is what I purchased the cameras for. Add that and it would be perfect. Returning.Previous review below.Set-Up:Took me a total of 15 minutes to mount and set up both mini cameras. A quick 1 minute YouTube video also showed me how to setup my camera through my echo show which was great. Simplicity gives this an overall 5/5 in my opinion.Camera Video/Audio Quality:For the money these cameras look great. Although not as wide as my previous security camera they do catch the entirety of a bedroom when placed in a corner (using these for my infant and toddler as nighttime cams).  They have around a two second delay to the live feed on the app which isn’t horrible and I haven’t noticed any buffering as of yet. 1080p looks great on my phone and echo show 5. No issues with video quality or clarity with night time view either.  The sound coming from the camera is great as well with no noticeable feedback. 5/5 in my opinion again.Blink App:I was skeptical of the app after seeing the reviews but I have to say I am pleasantly surprised. Setting up through my phone was easy through the app. My only gripe would be that I wish they would come out with an application for computers. The application only works with mobile devices and amazon devices which I was not aware of at my time of purchase. However, they work seamlessly with my phone, tablet, and echo show and I have read that computer support is a feature that is in the works. 4.5/5 in my opinion for not having pc/Mac support.App Security:This is something that I will update frequently as I want my cameras to have some form of security. First impressions are great though, every login from a device sends a verification email to me with whether or not I want that device to have access to my cameras.  As I am sure there has to be some vulnerability with these, I have not seen it yet or read about it yet. They do update the application frequently though with security updates as the most recent one was the day I got my devices. My first impression is a tentative 5/5, which is sure to change.Overall TLDR: 5/5. Setup great, Video/Audio great, Application good, security great first impression but time will tell.

The camera makes a horrible click on noise when viewing live so you’re unable to view quietly on babysitter or dog sitter.There is no stealth mode. Blacking out all noise and light indicators and live viewing is limited.I’m frustrated blink and Amazon think they can sell a device then subject me to their programming that you’re unable to change. Because it was on sale for $20, I’ll keep it until I find an alternative, if you need continuous live viewing and to privately view dogs or sitters, this is not for us.Settings allows you to supposedly turn off all indicator lights yet a red light still comes on. I love love this little cam, I’d love to have one in all black, silicone black skins cost $10-$12, I bought this to monitor my dog and needed it to not be visible but in white it sticks out like a sore thumb.

The night vision is abysmal, everything is just a light gray blur when it is dark; it only works in dim light or when the light is on so, completely useless. It's not pointing to or through a window or anything, just down into my garage (it's on a cabinet.) We're in the garage numerous times a day in various light conditions. There is nothing between the camera and us, and it is 10-15ft away. No light pollution going on around it, no smoke, the lens isn't dirty, it's no shining through a window or ANYTHING, I have no idea what the problem in. There is no reason at all it shouldn't see us.

123,Amazon Customer,Not the best value of available choices.,"  I have (or have had) Arlo, Blink, EZViz and Wyze cameras, and I have settled on Wyze for my indoor and outdoor system. The addition of the v3 Wyze Cams tipped the scale finally in their favor for all indoor and outdoor purposes. The Blink Mini is a decent camera, but the unacceptable flaw for me is the inability to watch SD card video (from the Sync Module2) through the app. Incredibly, it seems you have to remove the SD card from the sync module to view video stored on it from a device. Each of my Wyze v3 Cams has its own SD card, and I am able to see alert footage stored in the Wyze cloud and/or extended continuous footage from each camera's SD card through the Wyze app. If I see a Wyze alert video clip that ends before I want it to, or if I need to see events immediately preceding the alert clip, I can switch to PLAYBACK view and watch what is recorded continuously on the SD card for whatever length of time I want through the app. Also, the Blink Minis randomly stop recording events, and require power cycling before they will restart. The Arlo cameras had this same issue, and I junked them as a result. If you're away from home, as on vacation, and one of the cameras stops recording, you're out of luck until someone can power cycle the individual camera that has stopped recording motion. Not acceptable. The 7 Wyze v3 Cams have been extremely stable over a period of five months. The Wyze v3 Cams are priced about the same as the Blink Minis at this writing. I see no reason to accept the deficiencies of the Blink Minis when the Wyze V3 Cams are so much better.

125,Tom.M,Can't handle transition from daytime to nighttime and back again,"  I have run into an extremely annoying technical issue with this camera that severely limits it's usefulness.  It's a little hard to describe but I'll try to explain:First off, I use this camera in a front window next to my front door overlooking my porch.  I've noticed over time that I've missed some notifications of movement for actions that should have been caught (for example, a very large package being delivered to my front door which should have caught movement).  Some times I can go an entire day w/o notifications even though there is activity that should have triggered it.I have tested my theory and the issue is as follows:  The camera doesn't do a good job of transitioning from daytime to night time and sometimes gets ""stuck"" in one mode or the other.  If I notice I haven't received notifications in awhile I will go into ""LIVE"" mode to view a current stream and one of two things will happen:1) The screen will either be super bright and washed out (think almost completely white) and 'adjust down' into a normal picture.  If in this state the camera won't pick up movement because it is seeing almost all white until it adjusts2) The screen will be all black and 'adjust up' to a normal picture.  If in  this state it won't pick up movement at all as it is seeing almost all black screen.  SOMETIMES something very bright will make the system see it and adjust at that point.  For instance. If it is seeing all black something like very bright car lights will be seen and make it adjust.  Something like someone walking right up to the camera and waving will not be seen as the camera hasn't adjusted.It's a very unusual problem where the only fix that I can find is to manually pull up a live view in the morning and at night and making the camera adjust automatically.  I can tell this works bc the screen is either all black or white depending on whatever mode it got stuck in. I don't have confidence in the system as I have to manually intervene up to twice a day to make sure the camera can see things properly.  If I were to leave my home for a few days and forget to pull up a live view a few times a day I could potentially have someone force entry into my front door and or vandalize something and the system would be completely blind to that.My attached photo shows what the camera sees before it adjusts back down to normal levels during a live view.  In this instance it is using night time sensitivity during the daytime causing it to see hardly anything at all.  It can't see movement in the state and will not trigger motion notifications nor will it record anything.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2021"

It is easily better than the Wyze system which half of the time won't even turn on or connect to your WiFi. My biggest complaint is that there is no home and away feature. The Cloud cam had it, but these do not. If you are fine with your cameras being on all the time, then you won't care about this feature. I would prefer they not be on, which means you have to get on your app and turn them off when you get home. Your other option is to try to use IFTTT, which only works half of the time, or set up a voice command to Alexa to turn the cameras off. This is where I'm the most disappointed. Setting these things up with Alexa should be a breeze, however, it is not. You have very little control of the cameras from an Echo device, which is very disappointing.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2020"
127,Shawn,I have recommended this camera to friends and family. It is AMAZING!,"  UPDATED REVIEW: 6/18/20I am updating this review to add some pictures. I now have 4 blink mini cameras, I use three indoor and one outdoor. For the outdoor camera I purchased a 3rd party enclosure that is made specifically for the blink mini, I included a photo of this camera as well (it's the black one).So far I have had nearly zero problems with these cameras, there was one day that I noticed the camera LEDs blinking, and I was unable to access them, I assume this may have been an update.I have been waiting for blink to come out with an outdoor camera that could be wired, as I have no interest in changing batteries every week/month. I decided to test the mini with a 3rd party enclosure, so far so good!These cameras have a ton of settings, Ill add a pic of the software UI.Bottom line: I have 4 cameras, with excellent picture and night vision, for only around $120, an absolute steal! BUY THEM! :)ORIGINAL REVIEW:Great price, great app! Hopefully they make an outdoor wired camera soon! Crisp HD video and night vision. Perfect audio.You can mount this to stand, or to a wall, 2 screws provided.I just purchased 2 more! ^^",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2020"
128,AloysiusSF,If you mute mic then you cannot use. Making it worthless.,  Don’t waste your money on this camera unless you want it to pipe sound through all your Alexa devices all the time.  If you disable the microphone through the Blink app then you will not be able to view the video of the camera on your Alexa device. Unfortunately the microphone picks up all sounds and echos throughout the house on all Alexa devices. The only way to stop that is the turn down the volume on your Alexa device to mute. Who wants their Alexa device on mute. Making this device completely worthless unless you want to hear everything that’s coming through your camera.  The company could easily fix the solution but it’s clear they do not. They want to be able to listen in and spy on you apparently. Why else would they make it to where you cannot have the microphone on mute all the time if you want. I am looking for a camera with no microphone. I do not need sound I just want video. If you’re like me then do not buy this product. Or if you were just like the option of muting the microphone on the camera but still have video then buy a different camera.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2021"
129,Olivia,"Network Connection Issues, poor Blink support, & obnoxious clicking sound when motion detected","  Update: After weeks of attempting to trouble shoot reconnecting my Blink mini in a new apartment, I finally figured out the issue connecting to the wifi, no thanks to Blink Support whatsoever which suggested my wifi was not fast enough or that my firewall was blocking it. Neither was the real issue, I just needed to modify my network settings to enable special characters in the SSID. Only my 5GHz network name had a special character (being “@“) which somehow was not allowing my Blink to connect even though the Blink mini connects to the 2.4GHz network. Minor fluke that Blink support was unable to help me with after weeks of emails and a 30 minute useless phone call. Still unhappy with this product as it is making a clicking sound when it detects motion which is loud enough to wake me up when my cat walks around or if I roll over in bed. Flat out annoying.—————————I thought this was a great camera for the price but I moved to a new apartment and can’t get my Blink Mini connected to the new wifi network installed. All of my other smart devices work just fine with the new network. I’m a pretty tech savvy person and read through every possible reason why this device won’t connect to a new network and tested them all. I changed my network settings and even tried a wifi extender to improve the signal strength where I am setting up my new camera after the RouteThis app Blink Support sends you to told me I had poor connection. The wifi extender still didn’t work so I wired my wifi extender into the network so there shouldn’t be any issues with distance or slow wifi and it still won’t connect. Blink support has been the slowest and most useless support and I now have a useless device I’m likely going to have to toss.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2020"
130,BTown Cats,Do yourself a favor look for a different camera!,"  Pros:* Good Picture Quality* Easy to setupCons:* Needs new app* Only View one device at a time* Only View about a minute before video cuts out* Unstable ConnectionI got this for $5 with my Echo Show 8, and if I knew the overall poor experience with it I honestly wouldn't of even bothered. Don't get me wrong it has good picture quality, but that isn't everything. I also have a victure camera I use these in Concurrently with my baby monitor. That victure is almost as good quality with way more features, and a way better app. On the victure you can share and I can watch the feed on my device and my gf can see on her device at the same time. This Blink you can not do this. Victure you can watch the feed for a while before it goes to camera selection screen, this it cuts out roughly in a minute, maybe 2 minutes. Victure can pan and rotate, not this (Mention this for price points). See in my image uploads on the night vision quality of this over my victure camera, victure so much clearer. Granted this has the edge over normal daytime usage. This constantly dropping connection to camera, or get unauthorized access errors. So much where the Echo Show 8 can't even connect to it 90% of the time, and as I mentioned Amazon offered the bundle deal with this camera. It was very easy to setup. All you have to do is scan the QR Code on the camera, then connect to your Wi-Fi. Do yourself a favor and look into another camera, at least until amazon developers do a TOTALLY REWRITE of the software at least. Even for the price you can find a better camera with more features. I gave it 3 stars because of the picture quality and the ease of setup.

132,Verified Purchaser,"Not a security system, just a monitor system, a mediocre one at that","  I purchased multiple Blink items overall review-A real security system gives you at least 4 zones that can be adjusted and armed separately. It has an audible alarm, it may also have a cell phone connection. I have owned several such systems and had good service from them.Blink has none of these qualities.You can have ""zones"" but each will cost you $35 to $40 for a sync module so, 4 zones min $140 and you have nothing else. The cameras are not real motion detectors, as illumination does not set off motion detector like the blink cameras and doorbell do; hence multiple false alarms. If you use lights on timers  in the room with blink cameras they false alert each time a light turns on or off. Light control is a big part of security. Blink IR is very poor by today's standards.The Blink door bell has a sensitivity adjustment, but set to lowest setting it still alerts when a car goes down the street. It is 80' from my Blink doorbell to the edge of the road and it false alerts every time a vehicle goes in either direction.r I have mine on battery; you can hard wire it in place of your existing doorbell). Amazingly it alerts to cars but not to Amazon delivery people right in front of it. Yes it recorded 9 cars today (I live in a Cul-de-sac or I would have smashed the doorbell by now) but not the ghost that placed my Amazon package on the porch right in front of it.The Mini Cameras alert every time a light is turned on or off, but sometimes doesn't when I walk by.To use local storage instead of cloud you have to have at least one Sync module and an SD card. So if you have four zones as above example you add $10 to $20 per SD for each module which adds another $40 to $80 to your cost. Now all of your ""security recordings"" are on 4 different devices and totally separate. Does this sound like a security problem?The outdoor cameras are all three still in the box so I cannot tell what problems they will add. Too disappointed with Blink so far to waste time adding to my disappointment.The Echo Dot and Echo Show which Amazon recommended to go with the blink system are also still in the box so no info on problems they might have.I purchased all of this prior to Christmas in order to update and improve my 8 to 10 year old small security system. I do not use the Cloud for any security purpose so local storage was a must. Due to life in general, I did not have time to open and set everything up. When I finally got around to it, I became aware that the Mini's would work, but I had to purchase a Sync module to have local storage. Later found out that local only transfers videos to SD once a day and will NOT record Live View (yeah this is a security system LOL). You may notice that Blink does not tell you a lot of this in their description. For way less money I could have purchased a legitimate, real security system with 4, 6 or 8 zones and cameras with wifi and had something that I would trust and not hate. A friend suggested that I sell Blink on Craigslist. I told him the Blink system is bad: I would feel like a criminal asking money for it. It would make a good baby monitor using the Mini cameras, I guess.Amazon refuses to stand behind the Blink system since it is past their return date. I spoke with customer service and she transferred me to someone else for assistance with the Blink and they just hung up on me when I told them it was totally unsatisfactory.Buyer Beware. Just because Blink is owned by Amazon does not mean you will be pleased or they will stand behind it.I bought it, I didn't use it before return date so my fault for not doing my research. Now cut my loss and go to Costco and purchase a real functional security system.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2022"

But then one day it started clicking on and off by itself (the lens was opening and closing and brief recordings were listed in the blink app).None of us were using the camera at the time.This was very suspicions, and having someone else looking at our child in bed is terrifying.I am quite tech savvy, and take security seriously.  We have at-the-network security to help with all of the internet-of-things devices that tend to be less secure than a PC with a firewall.

135,Em,Works for me...,"  My apartment was recently broken into, so... I bought a three-pack of cameras and a Blink controller.  Got a controller and ONE camera - was told other two were back ordered, would arrive in a couple of weeks.  OK - if you follow all instructions on PC version of web site, in order, setup goes pretty smoothly.  One thing they DON'T tell you while they're trying to sell these to you, is that your Android phone has to be on version 5.0 or higher of Android OS, or it won't work.  You have to download an app to your phone, then configure a controller they haven't told you you have to buy yet to use the camera.  Then you configure the camera - have your WiFi password handy for both of these.  Amazon tries to convince you to buy cloud storage, tells you you can use the camera without it, then they tell you you need the cloud storage...  Confusing, but you can eventually figure out that you don't need it, which is what I wanted; a local storage option you can easily access if you need toSo far, the camera is working fine using the local storage option.  Very nice picture (for a security camera) on standard quality setting.  I cancelled the trial subscription to make sure that the stand-alone local storage option (on a USB drive plugged in to the Blink controller - I'm using a 16 Gb drive, but you can go much larger if desired) worked without one.  I plan on hiding the controller after I receive and install the other 2 cameras.  Only issues?  The night vision does not appear to be working on the camera (it is turned on in the setup), and my 2 cats set it off multiple times every night.

137,Scottleew,Very handy in the house - everyone should use something like this.,"  I work from home now and really didn't need these as we're homebodies, but decided to try a couple of them last year just so that if I heard a weird bump in the night in another part of the house I could look via the app and see if anything was going on.  So far no bumps.  However, recently had some water damage in the house and had to have a nationally known repair service come over (will remain unnamed but you can guess) to do the repairs.  They seemed professional when they came, got set up, and I told them we'd be in the back working if they needed anything.  Instincts told me to turn on my cameras.Cameras caught one of them going into a room they shouldn't have been in, snooping through drawers, picking up personal items to look at them (including a checkbook ?!?), etc.  Was alerted via the app of the motion, confronted them, he admitted it, kicked him out, and took it up with their superiors along with copies of the video that had been saved to the cloud, which I could download to my phone, etc.  If I didn't have these and was as trusting as many would be, who knows what might have happened from his snooping that I wouldn't have been aware of.So while these are good for home security when you are not home, they are also very good to have around if you have people working on/in your home as well.  The 1080p video isn't the absolute best on the market, and the night vision is so-so, but they're reasonably priced and the video is good enough for what the intended purpose is, in my opinion.

I have also found that occasionally the cameras switch to a black and white mode, which I have seen this in their camera snapshot and in some recordings - not sure how/why this happens.  Also, the camera, on a few occasions, said that it detected motion when there was none.  I'll have to play with sensitivity to see if maybe just a dust particle triggered it.I have not found out what happens when USB flash drive is full - does recording fail or does it start writing over oldest clips.Saying it has Alexa compatible interface is quite a stretch.  The only thing you get is audible notification of motion detected by a given camera.  There is no way to turn video recording on remotely via their App.  Hence one cannot do so via Alexa either.I have noticed that ""Live View Streaming seems delayed by about 2.5 seconds as compared to its less than 1 second when I had the 30 day trial of their basic plan.As to reliability, I wonder about the longevity of the cameras.  Of my initial order of 2 cameras, one was defective.  I had no trouble with replacement as Amazon interceded and shipped me new ones without waiting to receive defective ones.  This brings up an issue for all customers that purchase a combined multiple item shipment.  If one or more items is defective (less than total number of items in bundle) there is no way  of just getting the defective item replaced.  I've read reviews where others have had this situation and have to return all items before replacement is sent out.  This is a shortcoming of online purchasing.I am upping rating to 2 stars (I give  it a 2.5 which you cannot pick).

It doesn't detect motion until someone is directly under it and even then it only gets the back of them entering the front door.

The clarity on day and night mode are great, and I love the feature of being able to have a two-way talk system. The downside/fault of this product for me is the motion detection. I came home yesterday, walked in plain view of the camera (about 20’ away) and there was no motion detection. I walked closer and waved my arms around, still no motion detection. It took me walking across the entire field of view of the camera for it to pick me up and I received a notification on my phone about 20 seconds later, which isn’t too great in my opinion.

It's just fun just waiting to see what the cameras will pick up next. Even had a delivery person throw a package on my front porch which was dealt with later. So you never know what you will get. My son bought a condo and he now has cameras and enjoys the wildlife in his little back area. The picture of the deer laying down is from his back area. She comes regularly and lays out his back door.We both bought the blink doorbell and I'm very pleased with that especially where he lives he can see all of the delivery persons come to his door. It's nice you can even talk to who is ever at the door or scare animal off if need be. These cameras would be great Christmas or birthday presents especially if you have an elderly parent family member or just live in a questionable neighborhood.

How they’ve managed to keep such good ratings with all the negative reviews is a mystery to me!The cameras do not have the capability to arm or disarm each one individually. This is problematic for me. In addition, the cameras stop recording arbitrarily, often for hours at a time. In order to make these cameras work properly, one must check them every hour to see if they’re still working! If they’re not still working one must disarm and then re-arm the system. Not at all what a person wants to do when they’re  sleeping and hope that the cameras are filming as they’re supposed to. And certainly not what someone wants to deal with when they’re  away from home. This is not as the product was advertised. The  worst problem is that it doesn’t record everything, in that there are often white squares instead of films, and white squares with a line drawn through them instead of films. I tried contacting customer service via email and they sent me a boiler plate reply, which doesn’t help at all. And their only help phone line is only available two days a week from 5 PM till two in the morning! Not nearly the quality that I expected with this product. Don’t waste your money buy something else until and unless Blink gets their act togetherAddendum: Because it’s a month or two past an allowed return date, Amazon will not issue a refund or even a partial refund or even a credit towards a better product. Blink will not refund my money either, and their solution is  just “a workaround”, and for nearly $100 worth of cameras you would think they could do better.

148,Nancy,"High quality video and audio, good mount, no batteries to change, but the ""Talk"" feature is useless","  I have several of both the Minis and the outdoor models, and this Mini is almost identical to the outdoor and indoor models in terms of quality and features. The only real difference between them is the Mini isn't weather-proof, cannot handle the extreme temperatures of the outdoor models (-4 to 113 F), has a better mount, can be image-flipped, and runs solely on a power adapter instead of batteries.* Not Weather-proof: DO NOT use this mini camera outdoors or in an uninsulated building. It is not water-proof and will likely be damaged by humidity and high or low temperatures.* Mount & Image Flipping: this mount is great and allows easier installation locations than the indoor and outdoor cameras, because it's mounted from the bottom/top instead of the back.  Since this Mini can be mounted from the bottom or top, this means it can be turned at many more angles on all 3 axes than the Indoor/Outdoor. If you have to mount it upside-down, such as from a ceiling, the app simply allows you to flip the image vertically. The problem with the indoor/outdoor models is the mounting is on the back, which means you can't ""hang"" it from a ceiling and point it in any direction. Instead, if you want to mount the Indoor/Outdoor on a ceiling or near the ceiling, you have a very small angle to point it. This makes the Indoor/Outdoor cameras inconvenient to install from above in most situations because you'll end up having to point the camera directly outward from your mounting surface. If from a ceiling, it'll face down. If from the top of a wall, it'll face outward along the ceiling. The Mini's mount is much better.CONS:* The ""Talk"" feature is totally useless. Regardless of bandwidth or proximity to the router or a sync module (purchased separately), the Talk feature produces broken sound that is impossible to understand. Plus there's a long delay of 3-6 seconds, making this feature useless for conversations, even if the other person understood anything you were saying. Over several tests with all of our different Blink cameras, none of them produce clear enough speech that someone can understand you, no matter where the cameras are located.* No wired Ethernet option. This camera can only be used with a wireless router and Internet connection. There are no other options.* Cannot be used as a USB web cam* Cannot be used for continuous live feeds. The live feed only allows up to 30 seconds of viewing, and you must hit a Continue button every 30 seconds to keep it going. So if need a camera to leave running for frequent live video, Blink isn't what you're looking for.* Cloud Storage Subscription semi-requirement: the Blink Home Monitor App's features become limited if you don't purchase a cloud storage subscription. If you stick with the Sync Module for local storage and do not purchase any of the cloud storage plans, VIDEO CLIPS CANNOT BE VIEWED THROUGH THE APP. The app will only allow you to view the live feed, adjust camera settings, and use the Talk feature. Without a cloud storage subscription, the only way to view your camera's video clips is by physically taking your USB storage device (purchased separately) out of the Sync Module (purchased separately) and placed in a USB port on a computer (purchased separately).To be very clear here, if you do not purchase a cloud storage subscription, you will not be able to view any of the stored video clips (including motion-activated clips) from your phone. Period. This point has not been made clearly anywhere in the advertisements, support screens, Amazon product pages, or Blink Web site, but it's a crucial piece of information that the company is being very ambiguous about.To repeat, IF YOU DON'T PURCHASE A CLOUD STORAGE SUBSCRIPTION, YOU CANNOT VIEW YOUR VIDEO CLIPS THROUGH YOUR PHONE. I have seen some reviewers assert that this isn't technically possible, but as a software engineer I know this isn't true. The Blink developers clearly focused on developing the cloud storage and subscriptions, using the mobile app as the user's ""portal"" app to access and view the cloud-stored video clips, and have simply decided not to develop a mechanism for the mobile app to access the video clips stored in your Sync Module. I want to be very clear here....this IS POSSIBLE and would require a lot of development to accomplish, but Blink just doesn't provide this functionality (yet). Whether they are working on this feature and plan to add it in the future is unknown. But the lack of direct integration between the mobile app and the Sync Module's local storage (over the local network, especially) is a significant shortcoming in the entire Blink system. This also means that if your camera loses its internet connection, it will not capture video, you can't view the live feed, the Talk feature won't work, and you can't change the camera's settings.. The Blink system simply does not allow the mobile app to connect directly to a camera or Sync Module on your local network. It is designed to use the Internet only. This is a very important point that customers must understand. Both the camera and the Sync Module require an active Internet connection to function. They will not work independently or with just a wifi router. Internet is required.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2021"
149,Thomas E. Swantek Jr.,This device is a pain in the rear to hook up to Amazon cloud,"  We purchased this blink to put in our garage, at first we were real happy with the device until about a week ago when we were trying to hook up to Amazon cloud. We went through all the steps and then thought we had it until we received an e-mail telling us not to forget to connect it. SEVERAL e-mails later and we still haven't gotten it hook up.  In doing a google search it seems to be a constant complaint. Until Blink's customer service gets this issue taken care I am giving this blink camera a 1 star.Update. I am going to increase the stars only because the issue we were having has been taken care of. We purchased these back in November of 2020 somewhat knowing that they were fazing out the ""free"" cloud storage. We started receiving the e-mails and started getting everything taken care of to move to the Amazon cloud, well we thought we did. Fast forward to the end of May when my first e-mail was sent with a response few days later telling me how connect the account. This went on for over 2 weeks until finally someone was able to help me. We ended up having to unlink the blink to our Amazon account then reconnect and problem fixed.  We will now give it a 4 star and not a 5 because of having to pay extra  for the cloud service since the blink is now owned by Amazon",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2021"
150,Thomas E. Swantek Jr.,Ok camera for the price,"  So this camera requires a subscription to continue being able to see video captured while armed. I did not know this upon buying the camera and now it is limited to only doing live view which is pointless.Not a great security camera it is basically now useless without the additional cost of a subscription. Please advertise this up front and make it obvious to the consumer!!!!!***Original review:I purchased this to use as a baby monitor but didn’t realize it does not have a continuous live view feed, I should have read the reviews. It is a motion sensor camera and does not have a option to just always be on even though it is corded. The picture is clear and sound is clear, very little delay. The app is just ok, the clips don’t record very long. I currently have it in my front window to view the hallway outside my apartment.**update: so after having this for awhile I’ve noticed the camera doesn’t always pick up movement when armed. It will pick up activity for awhile and then there are gaps or it just doesn’t pick up at all. If I remember to I unarm it for a period of time and rearm it but it’s frustrating that I have to do that it should just pick up the activity.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2021"
151,Camilo Navarro,Unusable with night vision in garage,"  Update: I figured the issue is the camera being terrible at switching between IR and regular mode. My garage is dark when the door is closed. But when the door starts to open, a light turns on, which messes up the camera and it gets stuck in IR mode, even when there's a lot of light. It stops detecting motion after that and needs restarting. So, this camera is essentially useless with the IR mode if you have other light source that turns on and off. I'm changing my 2 starts to 1. I will still keep using it without the IR but this is very disappointing. I hope they will release an update, speeding up the response time to turn the IR light off when there's enough light in the view.Original review: I love Blink cameras. I have 8 of the older indoor cameras and 3 of the new outdoor ones. I didn't want to waste one of the outdoor ones in my garage just because I need a night vision, so I got a Mini. It is very stylish and super easy to set up. But the motion detection stops working after a few hours. I unplug it, plug it back in and it works for a few hours and then stops. The light comes on but nothing shows up in the app. This is the only camera out of 9 that does this.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2021"
152,Pictureman,Perfect for a family household.,"  This is absolutely perfect for a family that wants an extra layer of Security. I bought one as an add on with my echo and after seeing how it worked - I immediately ordered two more. Picture quality, night vision is perfect. The motion detector surpassed my expectation but there is a couple second delay ... so just know that. What I also like is it’s not continuously recording... you can’t go back to a Tuesday at 3pm and see what was going on... for a home I think that’s perfect I don’t want our entire household saved to the cloud lol - but you can view live and each time you click to view it automatically saves the clip (can be easily deleted in the app). You can also arm/disarm for motion detection which gives me peace of mind while sleeping or when you leave the house. The sensitivity is good - overall I absolutely recommend to anyone. The app is simple and has all that you need.  I work with camera systems and this is incredibly simple to install and use with your phone or the echo products.

153,B Rich,Hampered by One Flaw--No Local Saving,"  Edit 6/22/2021: Blink Customer Service contacted me and proved extremely helpful in resolving my issue with the lack of local storage. Although I still believe a local option should be built into the Blink software, I'm raising my review from 2 to 3 stars. In short: just be sure you know what you're buying here before plunking down the cash!At first, I thought this little camera was a true jewel--cheap, easy-to-use, and of (relatively) high quality. But like most things, there's a catch. All video recording is sent to the cloud via a subscription service that, although free at first, will eventually require a monthly payment. I didn't mind initially, as I naturally assumed I'd be able to save my videos to the phone itself.Well....you can't! People who want to record video for later viewing are out of luck unless they fork out the monthly bill. Of course, there's ABSOLUTELY no reason why local recording can't be offered; this is just the company forcing every user into becoming a monthly money dispenser. Obviously, the camera is almost useless without the ability to save what it records, and demanding everyone use the Cloud for such a crucial function is both shady and shameless.So, yeah...if you don't mind the essentially required subscription, this is a neat device. Otherwise, invest your money elsewhere.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2021"
154,R. Glaza,So disappointed in the customer service!,"  Beside the fact the camera goes offline/unarmed all on its own, I no longer can record unless I buy storage. I bought the mini cameras because the description indicated I did NOT need to buy cloud storage. They were okay enough for a few months (with cloud storage), so I decided to get 3 outdoor cameras. 2 of those are great and 1 has a terrible night vision picture. I knew I needed cloud or local storage for those and bought the USB storage. All is well and I get notified that I get a free 30 day trial of the cloud storage. I didn’t sign up for it because I didn’t need it for the mini cameras (I thought) and I have local storage for my outdoor cameras. Guess what!? Now that the 30 day trial is up for my outdoor cameras is up, I can no longer use my mini cameras. I contacted customer service and they basically said to bad. I want to return all 5 cameras, echo dot & echo show but of course it’s to late.

155,Vincent R. Singer,Pet parent entertainment & affordable security,"  Great addition to my blink system. Fantastic for the price. I actually got it to watch my dogs when I leave town and have people watching them. It’s compact and wired so I have it just sitting on the entertainment center to not deal with the wire being in the way. You can mount it ya surface or wall if you chose. I only have one indoor and multiple outdoor. It can see a wide area, you can choose what sections of the screen set it off if you are trying to avoid having a pert set it off. I like being able to talk through it, my dogs not so much. I am not a fan of how loud the app is, I thought it was just mine but it seems to be a common background noise for blink. I personally opted to not save to the cloud and got the memory stick instead of the monthly fee, I have no complaints, plenty of storage room. It is a basic system but if you are just looking for some peace of mind security, or a way to harass your dogs, this is a very functional and affordable option.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2021"
156,Mike K,Very unreliable cameras for surveillance,"  I bought these for security, wanted to see who was around the house when I was not home. Motion detection with recording worked perfect for first two days. No I have to disarm and arm the cameras Two or three times a day just so motion detection and recording work. Totally not reliable for protecting and theft from your home because motion detection with recording Doesn’t work more often than not.Update:I was contacted by Blink support today and they informed me that the blink mini cameras motion detection quits working randomly. They are aware of the problem and don’t know when it’s going to be fixed so in the meantime you have to disarm and then rearm The cameras several times a day to make sure they are armed and ready to record motion. Hopefully they get a software  update soon because this is totally not acceptable.

157,Gregory H.,Good competitor to Wyze,"  I have three of these. Set up is quick and I can view the cameras on my tablet and phone within a. couple of minutes.The only real problem I have with the Blink mini is the integration with the SHOW.  Alexa, on the SHOW, couldn't display the camera view. Every time I asked Alexa to show me ""camera name"" she responded that she couldn't. The reasons varied. She even tried to sell me more minis! I called Amazon Blink support and spent an hour on a wild goose chase. You know the drill; delete the camera, try a different name, reset the camera, unplug and replug, etc.,etc.. Nothing worked. The next day (yesterday) I called BLINK support and got a better trained technician who opined that it might take some time to sync. So I waited another day.Now (today) it all seems to work. So the  lesson I learned is to wait a couple of days before trying to get Alexa and SHOW to recognize the mini and to work the way it is advertised.When it is working the Mini is a good competitor to the Wize cam at 25 bucks. Daylight video quality is fair to good. Nighttime video is poor to fair. Response time, while a bit slow, is comparable to the Wyze. Controls are good and intuitional.

158,Ghost Leader,So Important for a Home Hospice Loved One,"  I've been caring for mom w/dementia for over 4 years. The last year has been rough as only family of this awful disease know. Most especially heartbreaking were the last 2 weeks. Mom had stopped drinking first and then a few days later, stopped eating. This little $20 camera was literally a God-send. It allowed me to constantly have access to her from my phone when I was somewhere else in the house - helping my dad, making him dinner, out with the dog etc. I set the motion detector so at night I would receive notification of her movements. It was so easy to 1)plug the cord into the camera and 2)download the app and then follow the directions to have a constant stream of my mom. Sadly mom passed yesterday, but I'm relieved she's at peace after watching her stop taking liquids and foods - so worried she was suffering and such an upsetting end of life to watch. This little, inexpensive camera gave me a little peace and rest during an awful period of our lives and as my dad is nearly 85 and wheelchair-ridden I know we will continue to use it.

159,Big Al MD,Audio 2-Way is horrible + camera viewing duration also horrible,"  I really want to like these cameras but there's a couple things that really suck, but hopefully can be corrected with software updates. I own 7 of them and use them multiple times a day.1. The latency and inability to talk and listen at the same time is the worst. If I've known that at the start I'd have looked elsewhere for cameras.2. The inability to continually watch a camera as a monitor and not have to click continue is the absolute worst. Again if I'd have known before hand I'd have not bought these.3. The bricks for the usb power outlet should absolutely have the usb port on the side at a 90 degree angle instead of coming straight out making wore routing on the wall much cleaner and nicerlooking. I went and bought some and would be very nice to see with future models.Please fix those other software / firmware issues.

160,Sarah ,Blink misses the mark on some obvious features.,"  This is an easy system to set up, but seriously misses the mark in some practical ways.The Blink system allows for no multiple streams at once.  So no checking on multiple kids on a single app pane.It does not allow for continuous monitoring - even on USB cameras plugged into AC.  You have to push a little ""continue"" button to keep the feed going.There is an audible ""click"" when a camera's night vision is activated.  This is not desirable when checking on sleeping kids.I'd recommend this for a vacation camera to be alerted to activity while you're away.

161,Heather,Mostly works,"  I bought this as a prime day special - so I've had it roughly 2-3 weeks.  I figured for $25 what did I have to lose? I set it up inside my garage for security.  Most of the time it works really well and sends a notification for each and every clip to my phone for review.  Sometimes it records the clip, but doesn't notify me and it isn't until later that I manually go in and look that I see the clip is saved in the app.  Just now I went to the garage and nothing happened.  I waved my arms in front of the camera and zero recording.  I unplugged it, waited 30 seconds, and plugged it back in. The camera reset and worked perfectly - recorded the image and sent a notification to my phone.  I can't figure out why it only mostly works, but there you are. If you are looking for something that is 100% reliable I don't think this is for you.

162,LUIS SUMAN,Good camera for certain uses,"  I like it and I’ll keep it but it’s not quite what I was looking for.  It is definitely useful for what it is made for (home security)Positives: nice quality, very easy to set up, picture and sound quality is good, you can speak into it, love there I can control everything on my phone.  It’s also small, compact and can be wall mounted.  You can set it to automatically alert you to movement and sound in your home and it’s pretty accurate. You can record and save video clips.Negatives: ( I’m using this as a monitor for my puppy but the same would likely apply to a baby monitor.  These negatives are mainly pertaining to this specific use, which is really not what this is meant for)You can’t continuously stream footage. You get a few seconds and then it asks if you want to continue. You can keep hitting continue but you couldn’t run this all night like a traditional baby monitor.  Also, my dog moving in her crate and even barking does not set off the motion/sound detector, even in the most sensitive setting. If a person walks by, it will give me an immediate alert on my phone. Since it’s just for the dog I’m not that concerned.  This is really meant for home security and NOT to be used as a monitor. So keep that in mind if that is your intention.Overall it’s a well made product that is easy to use and set up so I would recommend for home security or checking on your dog while you are out, but probably not as a baby monitor.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2020"
163,B Gator,Not Good Anymore Get Something Else 😕,  FINAL UPDATE: We live in a world of greed. People wanting to get rich. Not just make a living. Certain aspects of technology allows certain people to throttle performance. It worked great at first but a combination of internet providers and this manufacturer taking away features unless you pay them is a cop out against advancement. Why offer a better product capable of more at the same price when you can charge more for nothing... I really liked this system and hoped they would improve. Instead they chose to cheat the consumer. 😔 I have 8 of these mini cameras and 1 failed. Wouldn't connect back up. Worked for a year then went out. I invested so much money purchasing the minis and outdoor cameras for its ease of use and battery for easy connection and small footprint only to have them swindle people by taking options away and charging for it when previously it was an incentive to buy these. 👎 Looking back I should have purchased a more reliable security system. This is now just an expensive baby monitor that is not reliable. The minis are plugged in yet it only records in 30 sec slips with a minimum 10sec delay. If it is plugged in with constant power it should be able to record all day long or as long as your thumbdrive will let you. Its cloud service so they don't want you to cloud up their cloud. Bottom line this entire system is not recommended anymore. With some tweaks it would be THE system to get but with the quirks unreliability and paying extra for options that use to be included ... this is not a system worth spending money on for a real security system.UPDATE 4/28/21: I put up with all the flaws and problems and cloud storage was not a problem as you can save to a thumbdrive. But now they took away the ability to save live clips. You have to sign up for a monthly plan. I no longer recommend this system. You might as well pay for ADT or something.picture quality is good just as good as the all new Blink. Maybe a hair less maybe but overall clear image quality. The contrast colors dynamic range sharpness all pretty good and i don't even have it on the highest quality setting. 😮 Night vision is also just as good and you have some adjustments with the app. Audio is good doesn't have the humming and hissing as much as the battery powered ones. Speaker is ok you can clearly hear and speak but at close range like within 6ft. Volume could be louder. Motion detection works good. You can't be 50ft away and expect it to pick up motion consistently. You can adjust the sensitivity but you risk it picking up the slightest bit of movement. Its pretty good turning on slightly before entering frame especially with the beta option on the app at a normal reasonable range.I have 2 of them one in the garage and one in the back porch. I know these are indoor cameras but will see how they hold up. They are not going to get wet and we'll see how they handle hotter and colder temperatures than being indoors.The weather is nice right now so I hooked up an external battery and hid one in a flower pot. Makes for a nice spy cam sorta the white color sticks out. If you have the Blink system I don't see how you can pass these up. I got a 2 pack at $65 and they were also on sale for $25 each. At that price get some whether you plug it in to a wall socket or use an external battery this makes for a great addition to the Blink system. 😎👍I like the size of this camera. Too bad its not waterproof or battery powered. I hope they plan on a zoom feature in the future. 😉UPDATE: I'm about 5 months in and about a month ago there is a steady increase in the amount of failed views and failed thumbnails. It will also all of a sudden drop from the 30sec recording setting I have to a sec or two or even just a screen shot with blur. I can't get it to record back to normal. Frustrating and unreliable. I'm dropping the stars.UPDATE: After some troubleshooting I found that resetting the router and modem got everything back working again. So I'm raising the stars. Lets hope it doesn't need a reset frequently. 😉👍 Next version should be HD with zoom.UPDATE: It seems I'm having to reset the router and modem again and again more frequently now.

169,"B. Williams, Software Engineer",So-so if you're not willing to pay...,"  Let me start off by saying this was a really good camera,  at first.  During the 30 day free trial, I loved getting pictures and video clips once the motion sensor went off. The picture was clear and it I was happy with my buy. The longer I had it there were a few things I didn't like. One thing is all the lights that are on the camera. I'm sure they serve a purpose but I didn't try to figure it out,  I just covered them with black electrical tape. Still worked great. The other thing I didn't like was that you hear a small clicking noise sometimes when the camera kicks on to record.  I wish it was silent.  Then, the last thing I didn't like was after the 30 day trial.  If you don't pay for a subscription,  all you have access to is a notification of movement, no picture and no video. Then you can  manually go check out the live feed but if you don't see the notification right away, you miss everything. You can't save the live feed either.  I bought a Merkury camera at Walmart and I like it much better. The picture quality isnt as good as the Blink but it serves its purpose.  Without paying for a subscription it still takes a picture that you can view so you can see what set the camera off and you can record your live feed. It also is silent,  no wierd clicking noises. It also had  lights but that seems to be common with these types of cameras.

173,IA,Limited use for my purpose,"  My blink mini was an add on to an echo show on prime day.  I added my mini to a sync2 module which was included in my blink indoor camera kit.  The addition of the mini went smooth, it updated the firmware and added it to my system.  The firmware was updated.Plus -  Plug in camera with no batteries.  A different system of motion detection which works through windows at night.  Alexa integration lets you see live view on your echo show or your TV via Firestick with alexa  Scheduled arming seems to work, it can follow an entered schedule.Minus -  If you currently have a schedule in the system and turn off scheduled arm slider from the system settings page on the fire app and try to arm from the main page, the mini doesn't arm.  It is like the sync2 module never sent the command to the mini, in fact the date didn't even change at the end of the camera parameter page.  The date and time changed on my indoor and outdoor, just not the mini.  I found the only way to fix this was to delete the entire schedule, then hit arm from the main page and the mini started capturing motion again.  So the pause function for the schedule didn't work.  If you turn off the microphone on the mini, the echo show could no longer show you a live view of the mini via alexa,  turn it back on and everything works.  The motion detection through a window doesn't work in the daytime, but seems to work at night with night vision turned off, based on car headlights coming up the drive,  but during the daytime it isn't even triggered  by a mail truck coming up the driveway or a person carrying a package up the driveway.Overall – it has decent resolution.  While using through a window, I was disappointed it could not detect motion in the daytime but happy it can detect headlights at night with the night vision off.  You should note I am using the mini via the sync2 hub, and I think most people will use this directly without the sync2.  I used the sync2 in hopes of local storage which seems to just consist of a daily backup from the cloud to the USB drive.  Also note the app was running on a Fire tablet.  I plan to retest on a phone to see if the glitch is due to the application or the camera.  Anyways since it couldn't see a delivery truck driving up my driveway, I replaced it with a camera that could.  So if you are trying to catch deliveries during the pandemic, forget this one.  My other camera by someone else, in the same position through a window, triggers an alert if the poodle across the street comes out of their house, and of course a giant mail delivery truck.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2020"
174,Sammy Swartz,It's a nice camera; so now where's the Blink Doorbell camera to go with it?,"  I am pretty much OK with the Echo Show and Blink camera bundle, and the Blink Android app that integrates them.  In fact I like them so much that I now want to expand my system to include a video doorbell, and the obvious choice is to stick with Blink (and it if it's NOT obvious, I don't want to have multiple apps and interfaces and skills for my security system and I don't want to have to pay a monthly fee to store the motion-activated videos in a cloud when I have plenty of room for storage on my phone).  I want 180 degree video both horizontally and vertically.In doing my research, I find that Amazon, which owns both Blink and Ring, has been promising to offer a Blink doorbell since they acquired Blink in 2017 (-ish), but so far they have not followed through.  I'm beginning to think that they are stripping Blink of its assets (patents, etc.) and funneling them into Ring, which requires a monthly fee to work properly (and provides a never-ending income stream for Amazon).So - I think it's time to put up or shut up, Amazon.  Either produce the Blink doorbell and integrate it with the existing Blink app, or quit teasing us with unfulfilled promises.  Or come up with an app that works with both Blink and Ring, and doesn't require a subscription to function properly.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2021"

177,rod,Don't pay more than $5 for this,"  I have a bunch of IP cameras of different brands. You get what you pay for. Foscam seems to be the most consistent, and other off brands work well for about 6-9 months before the wireless chips or the motor on PTZ cameras start having problems.  This camera is no exception.It's pretty well known that this camera will not let you view it continuously in the app or with an echo show. Beyond that, they lost me a while ago when they forced an app update and required my phone number. Forced app updates are fine, but there is absolutely no reason they need my phone number. Ok fine, you can have my google number.That doesn't change the fact that when I try to view the camera on the echo show (as a baby monitor) the wifi gets more inconsistent as time goes on. Often you can unplug the camera and plug it back in to rectify the problem, but there's no reason you should have to do that. What's more, since it's being used as a baby monitor, the outlet is protected by a baby proof, and me-proof, contraption, so it's a pain to unplug and plug in again. There is constant buffering, which I'm not sure is due to the echo show or the camera itself. Both have excellent wifi signal. Either way, it does not work as intended/advertised for more than a few months.If you can get with a bundle for $5 like I did, go for it.

181,DJ Z,9.63 firmware Auto-Nightvision latchup bug,"  These were a great deal. Plug-in mini-cams that would sync with my existing Blink XT Outdoor setup and that didn't break the bank. It was especially compelling since previous users of Blink had free cloud storage.The good:- Picture quality for the same money, these are MUCH better than the Wyze Cam v2.- Small and unobtrusive.- Audio in/out is better than Wyze (although still not great)- Motion notifications are very fast.- Motion detection trigger is available for Alexa routines for other use (i.e. motion detect, turn on lights, make an announcement)The bad:- Critically, at least at firmware version 9.63, there is a bug where if the NightVision is left on Auto for a while, the camera will lock up and not detect motion when transitioning from Night to Day mode. It is a known bug that is acknowledged by Blink. Currently the only way to reset it is to perform a Disarm/Arm. However, this is very bad for non-light controlled areas, say a garage. A Garage would typically be in Night mode with the doors close, but if the light turns on, the camera crashes. This renders the camera unfit for purpose.- Live streaming is limited on time. So use as a monitor is unavailable.- No geofencing. For an outdoor camera, geofencing generally isn't useful as you'd want the cameras to still be on while you're at home. But for an indoor camera, this is important without having to manually arm/disarm the camera. The older Amazon Cloud Cams had this as an option and was great.- Integration with Alexa is extremely limited. There is no support for Routines. There is no support for Alexa Guard. Disabling cameras by voice is tedious (must say, ""Alexa, ask Blink to Disarm my Outside Front cameras, my pin is X X X X"". Alexa usually doesn't get it done.

But the moment I signed up for the monthly subscription, things immediately went downhill. The camera stopped detecting motion less than an hour of the payment processing. It catches and records movement whenever it wants to now. Sometimes it goes 1 or more full days without detecting anything. I've tried several times to sync it with my Echo device or other devices it claims to be compatible with but it never worked. It always gives a connection error message.Also, the app is always force closing at the most inconvenient times.I really wanted to love this product but its just not living up to its self proclaimed hype.

After about 30 seconds, it will ask if you want to continue, and if you don't hit yes, it will return to an old static shot. Secondly, and this is actually the bigger problem in my opinion, it clicks ENDLESSLY. Is there a way to make the clicking stop? The shutter clicks open, the red light turns on, the blue light turns on, the shutter clicks shut. It does this constantly.

If lights are on, it's sometimes works, but the night vision isn't good enough to capture movement. Even with sensitivity on highest setting, the camera doesn't capture motion at night unless you're right in front of the camera. If you're looking for daytime use, this is an okay camera, but if you're needing it for night time security, I suggest looking elsewhere. The only things that consistently trigger it are bugs flying directly in front of the camera, our cats walking nearby, or a light shadow on the wall from a neighbor's outside lights being turned on. People are never picked up at night, even if they walk directly in front of the camera. Blink was really great about sending us replacements, but the replacements do the exact same thing.

NO CONTINUOUS MONITORING- You won't be able to watch the stream continuously without having to click the continue button every 30 seconds. (They say it's designed to save battery but hey that's my issue to keep it charged. I prefer keeping it plugged in port rather than to click the button every 30 minutes.) I found a trick though but it isn't effective. You can watch uninterrupted for around 10 minutes through echo show but not everyone will have one and if in case someone has one than video on it is always slacking by 5-7 seconds.2.)NO SD  CARD SUPPORT-Only option to save your videos to cloud by subscribing to their cloud storage (limited storage)  otherwise forget to record anything on this.3.)MONITORING ONLY WORKS FOR SINGLE DEVICE AT A TIME: Feed will load only on a single device at a time so let's say if you are watching your child through it, your partner will not be able to see him/her.4.)MOBILE APPLICATION IS FULL OF BUGS: Their phone app has some major bugs. If motion video is being recorded by the system, you will not see the live feed. The app keeps getting freeze regularly no matter how powerful your smartphone is because it's not a phone issue, it's a software issue.This thing has major technical flaws which I guess they left intentionally in order to rip off customers later through the subscription model. Most of these flaws can be resolved by simple software updates but I doubt they will roll it out anytime soon. Only buy this if you don't have any other job to do and want to keep taping ""CONTINUE' every 30 seconds or have too much money to spend on their useless camera and subscription.

   After having many packages stolen off our porch, I decided I needed to get some cameras. The blink cameras are pretty small and very simple to set up using the app. I did have trouble setting one up because the app wasn’t able to sync with it. I ended up having to reset it several times. FYI, the reset button is on the bottom of the camera and you’ll have to use a pin needle to reset it.The quality of the cameras are decent. If pointing to a window you’ll have to adjust the night vision because you’ll see the glare of your window and you won’t be able to see what’s outside. The picture quality is decent, it’s no HD, but it’s really good.I’m able to check in on the cameras from my phone, iPad and even Echo. You can name your cameras so you can ask Alexa to show you a particular camera. You do have to pay for storage videos once your free month trial is over with.

I don't want/need cloud storage but I've lost the ability to have recorded clips.  What a scam to sell the device and change the rules after a year.  Not happy!!I now have my cameras installed in the care facility where we moved my mom.  I'm no longer able to monitor her without paying for a subscription.-----------------Got this along with an echo show when we brought my non ambulatory mom home from a care facility during covid.  We wanted the ability to check on her at night to make sure she wasn't trying to get out of bed into her wheelchair on her own.I've never had another camera to compare, but I've been very happy with this one. The picture is good even on night vision.  The motion sensor sensitivity can be set so we don't get a lot of false alarms.  It can also be disabled.

206,Topher Ray,"Buy the more expensive cameras, they work a lot better","  I have a small cabin up in the mountains and have owned blink cameras to monitor that cabin when I'm away from it since shortly after they came out.Those original, battery-operated cameras are a great choice for areas that see little traffic and movement, because they run off long-life batteries and are super easy to install.  They used to include free cloud storage of your clips as well.  For monitoring a second home or your primary residence when away, they are great.  Critically, they use a motion sensor to detect movement and then kick on the camera, much like a motion sensing floodlight.These new, mini cameras are very different, plugged into power all the time, and they connect directly to wifi, bypassing the low-power, wireless control system the battery cameras needed .  But they don't have any kind of motion sensor.  Instead they use algorithms to detect motion within the video image.  That is the root of the problem.Frankly, the algorithms suck.  Do you have leaves on your trees?  Do cars drive NEAR your area of intended detection at night?  If so you will get tons of false positives.I get false positives when the wind blows and so the patterns of light filtering through the trees changes.  I get false positives when a car drives down the street in front of my house at night because the headlights reflect off things and the camera interprets that as motion.Nobody wants a camera system that sends you 100 motion alerts a day, with 99 of them not detecting anything, and #100 being the mailman.These mini cameras are a poor substitute for the more expensive Blink cameras which I've had very good experiences with.  You can put these cheaper cameras somewhere where (1) you are not trying to detect motion and just want to be able to look at something, like maybe your basement sump or (2) interior areas with few windows.But forget about sticking these in your window and observing outside with them, they cannot handle any kind of environment with dynamic, natural light.  Also forget about places inside your house with a lot of windows, unless you have no trees, no clouds, no wind etc. because mottled sunlight filtering through the windows will routinely set them off.  You can maybe get away with a room with the blinds drawn but that's about it.So there is a viable use case for these, but it is a lot more narrow than most people expect.The camera image itself is fine, and setting them up is easy assuming you have a nearby place to plug them in.  They also perform very well in low light, with a good infrared system that lights up a pretty wide area.  Again, that system will only work indoors so you cannot point these out the window and have good results after dark.Would I buy these again?  Probably not.  They were cheap and I can find some places to use them, but they are a bit more limited in function than I had expected them to be.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2020"
207,NormaJean,Dont buy,"  So I bought this product to look in on our rabbits during the day. When we go into the blink app on different devices it constantly kicks you out so this is an app issue not a phone issue. So not only that but it does not actually record very much stuff. As you can see with the picture I included It had one video from Friday, no videos Saturday,Three videos on Sunday, then to on Monday then literally no recordings whatsoever for a full week. So if you’re trying to use this for any security purposes or actually need recordings don’t buy. I’m going to return and purchase another indoor ring product.

209,Ed,"VERY VERY BASIC. When it does record, it's a good clear picture, on your phone..","  I bought 3. The one I use pointed at the entryway works very well. But they do NOT work for anything past 15'. I have hummingbirds like you can't believe, and the camera is 3' away from the feeder. Even with 6 birds fighting, it will not trigger a clip. I have MOOSE in my back yard, along with Deer, right up against the window, every single day, but the camera will not pick up their activity, they move too slow, something as massive as a full blown bull moose eating willows by tearing into them, will not trigger the camera. 25 feet away max. But it will record shadows all day long, $3 a month to record is fair for the cloud. If it were any more than that I would give it 1 star and tell everyone to stay away. There's no data card slot. And it DOESN'T work with the fire stick on my TV. It tries. Alexa says to be patient, but all it does is spin and spin. My thoughts were to have live video of the hummingbirds in full HD on my TV as a background. None of it worked after messing with it all day trying everything, after awhile I just sent them all back.  This is good ONLY if you want to record inside a 12 x 12' room, the fact that it doesn't have a data card option is horrible,  seeing on the news how many people are being hacked these days, I would buy a camera that holds clips on a card on not their cloud. I don't want to worry people are watching me in my own bedroom and I feel like I have no control without the data card option. They're worthless for watching animals/birds. I tried everything to get them to work. Also a REALLY big no for me is that they have no options for setting the camera at a permanent zoomed setting. You can zoom a recorded clip, but you can't set the camera up as permanently zoomed in on anything..Still can't believe it will catch a moth flying by but not hummingbirds feeding 2,3,4,5,6 feet away. I tried 2 cameras and every thing I could think of.It would be good for a baby room, the mic is good. If I had a child. I would use this product. But I'm not going to record myself in my bed and only send all of it to their cloud. I'm not modest. But they're weirdos out in the world that could use it without my control. Night vision is so so. Unfortunately I can sit in my bed and see bats drinking out of the feeders but the night vision will not pick them up.Never did get to see anything on the TV.

210,Ed,Freezes and is not helping if actually trying to catch something going on.,"  UPDATE: It’s now freezing in the middle of me trying to catch the motion going on it’s ridiculous at this point. In the middle of me trying to see what was going on and what was all the noise, this thing just started freezing up causing me to miss what ever happened. So I exited the app and brought it back up and then it relayed this message as you see in the photo. That was really annoying because I was literally in the middle of trying to catch what that noise was and even my dog heard it and ran but I was too late to see what it was she was chasing and this thing didn’t catch anything on camera either because it was too busy freezing 🙄it’s ridiculous. This is literally what I brought the camera for. This thing has been annoying and it’s been defeating the purpose. Basically what this thing does is, it allows you to play live view for only 5mins at a time with an interpretation every 40 seconds asking you if you’d like to continue. If you don’t hurry up and click continue your live view will automatically end before the five mins is up and this ISNT HELPFUL AT ALL!! I feel like the time should have been longer. And the freezing doesn’t help how are we actually suppose to catch anything? I just don’t understand. It’s like you don’t know what can happen and when it can happen so I feel like the live should have been aloud to play all day or at least enough hours for you to actually catch anything unexpected because I’m literally still not catching anything and this camera is far from helpful. It doesn’t record anything either so I’m not able to know what’s going on unless I’m going back and forth to the app. This was originally brought for my basement being that I can’t always see everything there depending on where I am in the moment. My dog also goes in there a lot and I like to check on her as well. It’s really annoying trying to go back and forth every min to see what’s going on I’m literally still missing everything this way and can’t see what’s actually happening because it’s too many interruptions. I wish the live was able to sit on my device for just a longer period of time, doesn’t even have to be all day could at least be a hour or two. And the fact that it doesn’t record? I’d appreciate it if they’d at least allow this thing to record any motion or something. These are the reasons I brought the device and now I feel it’s not helping. The only good thing about it is that the view is good.ORIGINAL: I just set up my camera today and so far I’m able to view live views for a few mins at a time, but it isn’t letting me talk, I’m trying to click the talk button it says hold to talk, but when I hold it or click the button it isn’t doing anything. I been waiting for it to detect any motions as well being that my dog is all near the camera, but it didn’t detect anything. I’m giving this item a 3 star for now , and will change this review IF Amazon solve these issues for me.

It will pick up motion sometimes, then wont.Also, a little annoyed that the return window closes before the free trial ends. I didn't get to use it without the free trial but it says it will only work for Live views and Motion alerts if you don't sign up. I guess this means it wont record the motion? Not sure.Cannot use as a baby monitor - it will pause often and ask if you're still watching.I couldn't figure out how to get rid of the red notification bubble other than deleting all the saved motion videos or watching them.The picture quality is good.

212,Andre Hopkins,Works well inside.  But does not sense motion through windows.  Faster than other Blink models.,"  Initially I had it set up to look outside through a window.  When it worked, it worked pretty well.  But it missed at least half of the real events I want to capture, like cars coming in and out of my driveway, and people walking.  And then it captured shadows from clouds moving overhead, which I didn't want.  Sometimes it detected nothing for many hours at a time, and other times it was overly sensitive, picking up shadows, leaves moving, etc.  Additionally, the Android version of the app crashed all of the time.  The iOS version was better.My initial review was 2 stars:  Intermittent motion detection makes this nearly useless for security.To their credit, Blink's customer service reached out to me proactively after seeing this review and worked with me to resolve issues.  They explained that it would not be reliable through windows, and told me that weak WiFi signals were the cause of the app crashing.  I have subsequently moved the camera to look inside the house only, and it works fine.  And the android app does seem to behave better now that the WiFi link is stronger.  I guess it was crashing when the app couldn't connect to the camera.  Customer service also explained that deleting videos on the android version is totally different than on the iOS version.  You have to hold your finger on the video for a couple of seconds to select it, then you get the option to select all, or select others, for deletion.And best of all, customer service provided me a free new indoor blink unit, with their All-new Blink Indoor unit with the new Blink Sync module 2.  This unit runs on batteries, and talks to the sync unit which then talks to your WiFi.  I mounted it outside, under an overhang, and it works fine for picking up motion.  Hope it survives the elements.  I ended up then purchasing an All-new Blink outdoor unit, which works great at capturing outdoor motion.  As far as I can tell, the only difference between the indoor and outdoor units is the temperature range, but perhaps the outdoor unit has better moisture resistance?  We'll see.Only downside to the wireless, battery powered units that rely on the sync modules is that they are slower than the wired/WiFi Mini, since their wireless link is designed to be lower power than WiFi to conserve battery life.Bottom line:  These cameras all are fine at detecting motion, as long as there is no glass in between.  if you want to detect outdoor motion, buy the outdoor unit and mount it outside.  If you are only detecting indoor motion and can plug in the unit, this Blink mini is a great deal, is smaller and faster than the more expensive, battery-powered units.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2020"
213,Kev,Extreamly Dissapointed,"  I rarely take the time to wright a bad review but I will make exception in this case so read on...Started out in Nov- Dec 2018 with 6 XT Cameras. The first attempt was a fail because batteries only lasted 2 months and the signal does not work reliably with cellular data. When I asked Blink cust. service why such a short life compared to the claimed 2year battery life they said ""it depends on your usage"" and maybe ""its too cold"". So I explained the camera installed in my heated shop that does get at least 12-24 activation's per day and is within 20 ft of my WiFi router. It was recommended to keep the video clips short so I did program the camera to take short 10sec clips. Even still the batteries lasted only 2 months. At that point although disappointing, I abandoned the system without even trying any of the other 5 cameras which I assumed would not work well here in the Northest cold months. Fast forward to today. I had read about a Blink camera that could be plugged in to always be powered. I thought, problem solved but this was another failure. When installing the new, always powered white camera, it didn't register with the sync module. Of course I called Blink Cust. Service only to now learn that my 450.00 Orbi WiFi system is not truly compatable with Blink because according to the Blink Rep. Orbi, although a fantastic system, works on ""mesh"" and the Blink system doesn't play well with any ""mesh"" WiFi system. Now I""m pissed.Here's the problem. The Blink system claim of ""Two Year"" battery life is a wild exaggeration that only could work under the most optimistic conditions, always warm, not a ""mesh"" WiFi system and always a perfect 5bar cellular signal but Blink doesn't tell you about this until you have a problem. I suppose they figure for those situations, they would rather apologize after you buy the system, in the hope that by the time you figure this all out, the return window will be closed and they have your money. I guess the plan to have some people who will wright a bad review but that people may not read these before buying?If your reading this, I hope you will think about not buying the Blink camera system.

215,Dr. Candy,Stay away!!,"  This camera has zero features as far as ”security camera.” what you needed to know before your purchase this toy:1) no memory card capability, meaning you have to have a subscription to the cloud service otherwise you won't able to record anything2) without cloud service deception, you can use only in ”live view.” which requires you to tap the screen every 30 seconds. It has no constant view option. So it is useless if you want to use it to monitor anything.3) you basically have an option to mute or have the volume on when live view. There is a volume adjust button with very little sensibility. So, you either have it very loud where your whole environment can hear what is going on, or you have to set it mute.4) not user friendly at all. The app that you have to use in order to access the camera is not user friendly at all. It has very small letters, hard to read. Even if you are able to read it, the Icons doesn't make any sense and has no explanation.5) The night vision is a joke. Through the camera view, you won't able to see a difference between a cat and a raccoon from 4 feet distance6) the software and the operating system is not ready to use. Most of the time when you are trying to access the camera view, it says ""system is busy please wait."" What does it mean, I have no idea.7) considering all of the major issues that comes with this camera, I would never trust to purchase a cloud service from a company who poorly designed and taught through the whole idea of a ""security camera"".8) price!

217,Sutaru,It's Not Worth It,"  REVISED REVIEW:  Don't bother. Its useless without a subscription and it's just not very reliable. There's a delay on the devices after it detects something so you're always behind a good 7 seconds after you get warning a motion was detected.  Its pretty much useless if you want to stick it in a window pointing outside because the blue sensor light bounces off the window and it simply won't give you an image unless you like staring at a giant white orb. The app is faulty and doesn't always work and frankly the monthly subscription isn't worth it. I wouldn't bother with the blink at all. Amazon needs to get their sh!t together.Here is my FIRST REVIEW: I have two hooked up. One in my main Kitchen area in front of the entrance to my very tiny apartment and another in the window facing the entire outside entrance to where I live. The one facing the window really only works during the daytime. As one reviewer pointed out there is a reflection that mirrors off the device and basically creates a giant, white orb that's impossible to view or detect anything at night. The one in my kitchen area works well and the night vision is impressive but the camera as a whole misses the point. First, it's wired and you're limited as to where you can put it. Second, it's obviously not weather proof and you can't hide it somewhere outdoors. If you're trying to detect intruders coming from outdoors at night you're basically screwed because of that stupid sensor. It's also constantly buffering despite the fact that I have a reasonable high speed internet connection. It's also got some sort of delay that takes a little getting used too. For example, when it detects motion you basically have to remember that it's a recorded clip you're given warning about and have to wait for the damn thing to present it to you BEFORE you can watch it in live mode which is also REALLY annoying. I'm on day two of my free trial subscription (which is really sneaky price wise when the free trial ends) and I'm on the fence about it.  It also has an issue when hooked up to your Alexa devices. I have three different generations of Echos. The most current is the 3rd with motion detection...For some odd reason Alexa doesn't always acknowledge the names you give your blink device instead it announces the full model numbers when it detects something and that is super annoying.  I'm going to try to give these things a chance and see what happens if I reposition the one in my window so I don't get that weird orb but for the time being I have to give it a ""meh"" rating. In terms of picture quality it's great but other than that it's not really all that impressive and I would NOT recommend this particular model as a baby monitor it's too clumsy for that sort of thing.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2021"

I own various Wyze cams and thought this Blink Mini may be good to own as well.Picture:The Blink Mini has amazing picture quality in my opinion and it has pretty responsive load times when asking an Echo Show to show you the camera.Audio:The audio is amazing. It's clear and also pics up even the slightest details. We used it as a baby monitor for a couple of days and it picked up every little sound, even the ambient noise playing in the background.Motion detection:When camera is set to active, it definitely responds well to motion and notifies you faithfully.Why 3 stars?While the hardware is pretty good, for one, it doesn't have a screw mount, something standard on many security cameras.The software is trash.If an echo show is displaying the camera, you can't open the live stream on the app.There is a live stream limit on echo devices. After a few minutes, our Echo Show would say ""the camera isn't responding"" and it would disconnect. To which we'd then have to repeatedly ask it to show the camera again. We've never had this issue with our Wyze cams. Also, on a regular basis the camera would not load the live view on our Echo Show the first couple of times we'd ask.The software is clunky. For being in the 2020s, the software interface looks dated. I'd expect a much more elegant finish. Prettier buttons, smoother interface, etc.Overall, if you just want something you can connect to just to see what's happening in the moment, go for it.

219,Auriolette,"Good for Live Views, Motion Detection Doesn't Work","  I'll start of by saying I've been a Blink user since the first generation and I love their products and have convinced several friends and family to buy a system. I have all Blink XT cameras and they work wonderfully but I wanted something to put in the garage and leave on all the time to record motion without killing batteries. This product seemed to fit the bill as it was a cheap add one with all the features I wanted such as night vision, motion detection, 2-way talk, and plug in power. However, after almost a year of use, I've not been able to successfully figure out a reliable way to get the motion detection to work automatically like the rest of my Blink XT cameras. The Blink Mini seems to have a hardware or software bug that won't allow it to record motion unless you manually disarm, then rearm the system. If you do this, it will record motion until it switches to IR (night mode) and then it stops recording motion. The same happens if it is armed/dearmed from night to day mode. It seems like it can't transition automatically from night to day on its own. I thought they would push an update to fix this error but 9 months later, I'm still waiting...... I've tried numerous workarounds such as leaving it in IR mode, day mode, turning off status indicator, etc with no luck. I guess I should chalk it up to only costing $25 so you get what you pay for. If you just want a plug-in camera to check periodically via live views, this camera works great! if you want it for part of your security system and home monitoring, stick with the regular blink cameras. If you really want to nerd out you can read about how (allegedly) the mini cameras use some sort of pixel difference technology versus infrared heat on regular wireless cameras. I found the Blink Mini to be a nuisance when motion detection actually does work, especially at night. The camera would pick up moving dust particles floating by the camera reflecting the IR light. I suppose its better to pick up more motion rather than less and since it's plugged in, it's not killing the battery, just flooding my free storage (yay for free cloud storage as legacy customer!). Bottom line, stick to regular Blink wireless cameras for motion detection, but this for live views indoors.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 21, 2021"

On these box it says go to www.blink. blah blah blah for mounting instructions. After looking through the website, that works for crap, o finally found mounting instructions and it literally says to mount it using the provided screws lol.I have several Ring products that are so vastly superior they make the blink look like something from Android v.1.

221,Fan,Had higher expectations,"  Blink is a camera we've all heard of dozens of times so I expected it to be a good camera and it's just ok. The picture/video from the camera is almost like a fish bowl lense filter is on it, motion detection is slow and the video has at the very least a 5 second delay. I tried to use this in a window to watch the deer that come to the feeder in the back yard but it didn't catch the motion through the window or maybe it's the distance. I also had to turn off all night vision for it as it would reflect back through the window and only give you a white light of a screen when trying to view night vision. Turned on a porch light and that seemed to work enough to see at night but it didn't pick up the motion. I now use it with the free trial to keep an eye on the dogs when they are home alone and out which is rare. I usually put them in the bedroom with a baby gate up so they can still see and hear what's going on inside the house so I don't even really use the camera. I'd send it back but it's not worth the cost of gas to drive to a drop off location at this point. Maybe I'll just give it to a family member who doesn't mind the delay, the poor night vision and the poor motion detection. Idt I'd trust it as a baby monitor or even to get live updates on pets bc of the delay. The audio is also very poor. The charging cable is very long. It actually came with a charging brick as well which my phone didn't even come with now a days and it is very small and could easily be concealed if it needed to be so I'll go half way and give 3 stars.

We had saved for quite a while, and the first thing we did was add the mini to our 2 camera system, and shortly after, we went out of town. We were treated to the view of our Yorkie in the window howling!!  We were able to talk to him for the first time, and calm him down, and that was worth the price of the mini alone!But later when we started setting up the remaining cameras to watch various wildlife from our patio we found the 4th camera worked, (the first of our 5 pack of XT-2s), but when we went to add the next one we hit the wall. The camera could not connect in Live view—so I tried setting up a different one and it wouldnt work either.  Tried downgrading all the settings, the resolution, recording length, nothing worked. Our internet connection is only 45mps, but that should be sufficient for standard resolution. Nothing I read before ordering indicated that multiple cameras would require extra robust bandwidth.On reading more suggestions through the very limited support pages, I tried the suggestion to reboot the sync module, but after rebooting it wouldn’t go into set up mode—just one lone blue light. Next suggestion, try hard a reset of the sync module. It still wouldn’t go into set-up mode. I also tried a bunch of other things suggested, including removing and reinstalling the cameras, then removing the whole system and setting up the system on the newer sync module, which was an extra at this point. I could never get either sync module to go into the set-up mode again, and couldnt connect any cameras to it otherwise. I can’t believe I have two defective sync modules, but darned if I know how to reset everything, nor do I know if it would help with adding my additional cameras.After eagerly looking forward to expanding our system, we are so disappointed. I still am not sure I can even get my original system back up and working any longer now, since even my original sync module is stuck. But I am returning it today, because its my last day to do so. Very disappointed.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2020"

   the camera works amazing, BUT, it is not in any way secure. i work with tech, and typically i actually wouldn’t use a cheap camera like this (i received it for $5 with my echo show but it still is cheap regularly nonetheless). i got two since they sent the first with a missing part (the usb wall plug), and i used one to monitor the driveway from my bedroom window in case my cat got out and the other for my bedroom as my cat has seizures.i went on a vacation to meet my brother and the bedroom camera kept crashing, at this point i was not aware of any breaches though nor do i know now if the crashing was from the breach, and i was unable to watch my cat and make sure she was alright when i was on the other side of the state.when i came home a couple of days later i unarmed the camera so motion activation would no longer be on, but i still didn’t take it down because only a couple days had passed since i had returned. i was working on a iphone at my desk to repair, then i look in the corner of my eye and notice that my camera’s LED light was on (the one that shows someone is actively viewing the live feed). i immediately unplugged it then went into the app and checked the driveway camera in my room that hears sounds from my room and tried to view it and it said that it was already being viewed and that i could not view it. immediately unplugged that one too. i would only use these in emergency to plug in then  plug out if you absolutely need to. they do have good night vision and record good motion activated videos. but they do also make you pay for cloud.i reccomend a wansview. i had one a year or more ago. whenever someone outside tries to access your camera you get notified and there is a log. you can also insert an SD card into them and review past footage, and it records offline. i got a small one about the size of this back then and it was black and i believe it was around $35",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2021"
224,Angel,"Good camera, easy set up.","  I think this is a great addition to my outdoor camera. I don't have the need for extremely high definition video quality, I just like knowing the basics of what is going on around my house. That being said, the picture quality could definitely be improved. If this video captured someone in my home and I had to submit it to authorities to hunt the person down, it would probably be one of those videos where you swear the person looks like someone you know, but you just can't be sure. LOL. But I can definitely see which one of my kids leaves the milk on the counter overnight, sneaks downstairs at 1:00am during quarantine and drinks the last of the My Dew.The camera (outdoor XT2 as well) has very bad audio unfortunately. Sounds as if a quiet motor is running constantly in every clip. The outdoor one was so bad that I had a neighbor stop over my house to check my pool because I thought maybe something was wrong with the pump/motor. I've learned to deal with the noise and just disregard it. I did want to point out that it is an issue for sure but for the price, can't really complain. As for adding this to your current system, you are essentially grandfathered in to free cloud storage. It's important to know this as it is a major selling point for lots of people. Other reviewers complained about this but the free cloud storage was confirmed to me by email from Blink. I can't speak for new customers, but current folks just adding a new camera, there won't be any charge. Camera sets up super easy. There is plenty of wiring to reach your electrical socket. All in all, I'd recommend it to a friend.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2020"
225,D JOHNSON,"Nice camera, power adapter sticks out too far","  This thing works great. But so did the other battery powered versions and you could place them literally anywhere.  Picture is great. Setup is super easy. Don’t care so much about the 2way talk since I only use it to watch the cat, but it’s a nice feature when I wanna scream at the cat remotely.What’s not so great and where it looses a star is the power adapter. This camera uses a mini-USB to to full-size USB cord that plugs into a 5V wall adapter outlet plug. Problem is that adapter is long and sticks out quite far from the wall and the USB port is right on the end of it. So when you plug in the cord which also has the end on it which sticks out also, together it stIcks out 3-4 inches from the wall.Given where you’ll likely put this, near an outlet around furniture or shelves where you’ll want to route and hide the cord and plug behind stuff or furniture, it seems a poor design. The plug adapter should have been made flatter and the USB port mounted on the side. That way at least you can push the furniture up against the plug and cord snugly without worry of damaging the cord. As it is the furniture I have against it sticks out quite far.Your only work around here is a power strip with a flat wall plug and just plug into that.I realize there are trade offs with design and others might find a flatter side ported adapter irritating since it might crowd adjacent plugs on a power strip. But powers strips have way more placement flexibility than a wall socket does.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2020"
226,Stephanie O,"An Okay Set-up, Handy and inexpensive.","  So one of the things that Blink does really well is make it easy to set-up everything. I mean it's an app, you follow along, and they're online and just working. The battery thing is convenient but in the house, there are plugs everywhere which is really convenient for something that likes to send you pictures and notices but also warns you when it's too active about batteries. I mean that's the real benefit right, constant power here for those of us who are not as handy with wiring battery ones to a power supply.The minis struggle a bit more with night vision, and I think the reason why is there's just more stuff close up to an internal camera than what I have with my external ones. For instance, one has access or view of a window. Every night it ""detects"" motion or something and shift t night vision. There is nothing there. There is never anything there so I assume it's just the shifting of the light when the sun goes down.  The other one has a hard time of getting a clear enough picture of the door with a chain, even though it's not that far. I think it's because that camera is trying to focus on the table instead of the entryway it's ""guarding"". I've tried to shift things a bit with only minor success.Aside from those focusing issues, the only other problem is I just want to turn cameras on and off or schedule them. When they're in the house and people are here... no need to have it notifying all the time. Also the app is too slow. In theory you can get a motion detection and then just go live and speak to them... well if takes 20 seconds for the dang app to load the person has gotten board and left already. It sounds short, it's a long time to just stand there. I use an s10. I know it's not the most fancy phone now, but I don't really experience much issues with other apps.I have yet to find the Blink talk to the person feature to be useful due to how long it takes to get the notification, load the app and finally have it ready to talk. People don't stand there that long. And with the rest of blink, if your internet goes down... it just doesn't work. It seems like we need something to accommodate for when the internet goes down but the intranet is still up.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2020"
227,Kevin,awesome camera!,"  10/10 starts for this product.Set up: 2 cameras took less than 10 minutes to get online and going, including downloading the app.Day detection: great! Picture is awesome!Night vision: very good for these little tiny cameras.Motion sense - does a great job with recording, so far has caught everything we have thrown at it.Downsides: I have fat fingers and accidently deleted all my clips stored. I have terrible neighbors (one parties all the time and the other is a drunk who recently tried to break into my apartment- hence the security cameras) so I was trying to save the video clips of the things that go on here. There is a way to save the video clips to your phone and I know how to do this now, so thats what I do.overall the downside is just my fault, not the apps fault. Easy to overcome.

228,Cathie,Mediocre night vision and motion detection,"  I've got 3 of these throughout the house to monitor my pets when I'm out during the day and when traveling and am using a dog sitter.  The day performance is acceptable, but at night, the picture quality is fairly poor.  The built in IR light will reflect off whatever surface you place the camera, and reflects back into the lense causing a ghosting effect.  I've had to push the cameras right up to the very edge of the shelf to eliminate this reflection issue.At night, the motion detection is poor unless its mainly in front of the camera.  It does not reliably pick up motion off to the sides if more than 5 or 6 feet away.The provided power cord is also fairly short, so figure out where you're going to locate the cameras, and measure to see how far it is to the closest outlet.  Longer USB cables are available, or you can use an extension cord as necessary... but Amazon could have provided an extra few feet on the cord and it would have saved me a lot of hassle.The audio pickup is ok when you're listening on a phone, but when trying to talk to someone on the camera end, the volume is a bit low unless in a quiet room.In the end, these camera's work, and I've not had any reliability issues.  The Amazon Blink service is extremely reliable and I've not had any cameras drop offline.  IMHO, If you buy these when there's a good sale, they are ""ok"", but I wouldn't pay full price for them.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2022"
229,team W,Mixed Feelings,"  I have mixed feelings on this camera setup. I obviously didn't have super high expectations because of the price but needed something within my budget to keep my family and my home safe.Pros:Budget friendly, ease of use, picture quality, settings.I do think the cameras are easy to use and I really like the quality of the pictures during daylight and that you can zoom in on them. I also enjoy the set alarm feature where I can activate the cameras automatically for times I am routinely not home. It's really nice to have that option so I'm not forgetting to activate the cameras every time I leave.Cons:Camera not activating upon activity, clip lengths, cord concerns, subscription plan.I do not like the fact that on multiple occasions during ""dark mode"" my camera has not picked up activity until it after a minute or two, which is way too long when you have someone breaking into your home at 1 am. I had someone come into my home at 1:08 am and even coughed loudly but my camera did not active until 1:10.I really wish the clip lengths were longer and or no downtime in between clips during activity. I understand there is a live view feature but that's not helpful if you are unable to click on that in the app during such events as stated above.I also had someone use one of my camera cords as a phone charger and it has not worked to charge my camera since. I don't know if that was intentional of the person using it but I have purchased a replacement cord and will update if it works when I receive the cord. With that being said, what will happen if someone doesn't have a subscription plan and tries to view occurances on USB? Is that going to ruin their cord?I really wish we only had to pay for clips we keep. I really enjoy the updates I get when I'm not home but if I don't need to keep the clips than I delete them. I feel it's expensive for multiple camera subscription plan to be able to see what's going on while it's happening.Ultimately, If you need something on a budget this is a great option for you.

230,Terri M,NOT  a CCTV system replacement,"  I was in the CCTV/Security industry for several years.This product works as a basic network camera with some security features, BUT This is NOT a CCTV replacement product !Main Differences:1. This product does NOT support real-time multi-view of multiple cameras. NO ""continuous"" multi-channel (and single channel) videos. ONLY on-demand single-channel view with time limitation. You can only see one channel at any given time and need to hit ""continue"" to keep on viewing live video after certain time.2. It does NOT support any alternative viewing options by using conventional security camera viewing protocols (such as DVRs or direct viewing via web interface or internal/external IP address links). You can only use the manufacture's app with VERY LIMITED customization and functionality.3. IF you trust the manufacture, it MIGHT be more secure by going through their platforms/servers (assuming encrypted) to view your private videos. Traditional CCTV system does not go through 3rd party system other than the ISP (therefore you need to consider security by yourself by setting up firewalls or using advanced routing techniques).Conclusion:If you are looking for a traditional CCTV/Security Camera functionalities/experiences, go for REAL CCTV systems/IP cameras. They are also available on Amazon. The learning curve will be more steep and it is more challenging to setup, but it will be well worth it if you find a good system.If you only would like to have a simple and trouble-free setting up experience, and  are willing to sacrifice some powerful features a true network/IP camera system can offer, you can consider this kind of cameras.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2021"

233,rsl,Thus far overall not bad considering the price.,"  Not bad for the price - but it could be done even better with probably little effort if the vendor would implement it.The (daylight) picture is pretty good for an inexpensive camera like this. I bought this for use with my Show for remote viewing and monitoring. Some people complained about the Blink app Life View time restriction of 30 seconds on the app and you have to frequently press a button to continue or the viewing will time out. True, but on the Blink skill on the show you don't have to do that - works for me and if you primarily use the Show and the app as on-the-road stop-gap, it is pretty good i.e. considering the small pricepoint.I also bought a Blink Outdoor camera kit, primarily for getting the Sync Module which I appearently can't purchase separately. Being able to record locally sounds pretty awesome, but I haven't set that up yet. For me that is the killer feature of the Blink line.Now the ""bad"": Night vision: It seems to me that like in any other camera at this price point (including 2-3 times it's price), it is not really night vision. It is probably more IR sensitive than daylight, but/and the camera has an IR light build in, so it lights up the environment for the camera to see. The problem now is that if you place this camera at a window and point it outside - the IR light reflects at the window and blinds the camera. Now you can't see anything other than a bright light. (the Ring Doorbells do that as well - if you mount them behind a storm door and if you put the glass in when it get's colder - you can't see anything anymore at night for the same reason - many people complained about that). Now, this could get helped if the manufacturer would allow a way to disable that light - if I had to, I could use an external IR light, that would be perfectly satisfactory for me. But it appears right now one can't do that. Also attempting to masking/tape-off the diode where unsuccessful - too much light reflects on my tapes and bleeds through the acrylic cover and I am thinking about opening the case and cut the wire to the diode, I will let you know. So please Mr. & Mrs. Manufacturer please allow for soft disabling the IR illumination feature.

236,David,Could be adequate in some cases,"  Hardware wise: the Blink camera is certainly adequate. The picture and audio quality is decent, especially for the price, and if judging solely by that my rating would probably be 4 stars.Software wise: The Blink security monitoring app might be okay if you live alone or otherwise going to be the only person monitoring the system. Even then, there's the annoyance of the live feed asking you every 30 seconds if you want to continue. I imagine this was leftover from the models that run off of batteries, but there should be an option in the settings to allow for continuous non-interrupted viewing.If however, you have a spouse/significant other and/or kids (or whoever) that also need access that is where this system falls apart. You are expected to have everyone sign in to the same Blink account, with same username and password, with everyone having complete control of the system. Also, (from what I understand) if someone is monitoring the live feed then everyone else is locked out. Even if it's just a spouse and you don't mind using the same account, then whenever the secondary person signs in, it will send the 2 factor authorization code to the primary account holder's phone. So you as primary will have to send the code to them every time they log on.I unfortunately did not know any of this when I got the Blink camera. From my research, these same issues have been directed toward Blink in the discussion boards but nothing has ever been fixed.

239,Walker,"Seems great at first, but it gets really annoying over time","  The installation process seemed smooth, and the initial impression was great. However, it slowly turned out to be a mess.I've been using the cameras (3 minis, on top of 4 XT2). XT2 aren't ideal too, but at least I can forgive them since they are battery-powered and require some limitations. I don't see a reason for all the problems below for Minis though.The worst part is reliability: random ""System is busy"", ""Camera is offline"", show up in the worst moments. It seems that I can make it crash almost every time if I use live view for longer than a minute or two. This camera has two main features, Live view and motion detection - how can you screw up your primary feature that badly?Other stuff:- it randomly records videos from live view, even though I have the ""discard"" setting selected, and never even tried to save live views.- motion detection is sub-par, sometimes it will catch a fly, the other time it won't catch my daughter struggling to get to the toilet for over 10 seconds.- recording has a delay, so often the motion is not caught on the camera, as well as it cuts out after a certain time. I understand the limitations for a camera like XT2 which is powered by batteries, but why have the same limitations on mini? It's wired after all. Record it the moment you detect the movement (ok, give it a second or two to ignore a fly or similar thing), and record as long as the motion is detected or the disk is filled up - easy.- if you sent me a notification about movement, why do you send another 30 seconds later? Like, I already know something was moving, I will switch to live view or watch the recordings! Make a reasonable break between notifications, like 5 minutes (or make it configurable).- it makes a clicky noise every time I switch to live view - why?I gave it 2 stars because it has potential: the form factor is good, installation is nice, and when it works, it's kinda ok.

We still have people coming in and out all night. I have tried manually setting it to night mode to see if that would help. I have tried upping the sensitivity all the way. For whatever reason, it doesn't like the hallway where it's placed unless light is coming in from outside. And as you can see from the photos, there should be enough light to at least catch movement.

   Caught the guy tossing my very expensive package. Its a great thought. But it doesnt really work. It records everything that doesnt matter and hasnt yet recorded anything important. I wait for the notification the mail man arrives. I dont get it but i get every other car that goes by. It is ONLY motion sensor. No way to just record non stop. The motion sensors have a way to cut out what part of the camera to ignore the motions. But it doesnt. It stills records everything but what you want it to. Its cool. But thats it. I have five of them. Two in my house recording my dogs and i still cant get it to discover which pup is jumping on the counters. But it can show each time they scratch their ass.

244,Honest Reviews,AMAZON Blink Camers do NOT work with AMAZON KEY,"  This would be 5 stars if the AMAZON Blink mini worked with AMAZON Key.  I assumed both being AMAZON I would have no problem, you know what they say about assuming...so if you're getting one of these for Amazon Key, don't... the camera itself is great, it is a plug in cam so it needs to go close to a plug obviously but the quality is awesome...perfect for the garage...I'm just saying.  The 1 star is because Amazon needs to make all of their products compatible with each other, that is asinine, get it togeter!Edit - Nov 2021 - so even if they get it to work together this is JUNK!  It's more of a headache than it's worth because the damn settings change themselves and now I can't even turn on the night vision, the camera turns it back to off, no matter what I do.

245,Alex,"I have mixed feelings about this...the camera is a 5, the app is a 1","  The camera has really good picture quality, and the motion detection is better than I've seen on other camera.  You can block out sections of the room and only watch for motion exactly where you need to.About the app, I am very disappointed in it.  Not only is it difficult to use because it is not well organized, but there is no way to share the app with someone else.  I am using this for my elderly mother, who has 24 hour caregivers.  I just wanted the person that is working at the time to be able to leave the room when my mother is in bed, and get a notification if she starts moving or gets out of bed.  I put the app on one of the caregivers phones, then logged her in using my account (since there no way to share).  Then I turned the notifications off on my phone, because I didn't want to receive notifications when someone else was with my mother.  When I made that change on my phone, it made the same change on the caregiver's phone - it turned off notifications.The only solution was to put the app on an old smart phone and leave that phone at my mother's house.  It solved the issues, but there still is no way that I  can turn off my phone, then turn it back on if I need to watch her.  I have to uninstall the app on my phone so I don't receive notifications all the time.  They really need to fix this.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2020"
246,Jay Sampson,Great cameras for the price.  Lacking important capabilities.,"  THE GOOD:Let me start by saying these are great little cameras for the price!  I was very happy with how easy setup was.  I bought 4 wired indoor cameras & 2 outdoor wireless cameras.  After the first camera setup,  which took about 20 minutes (my lack of experience),  the next 5 took about 10 minutes each (the better part of that time was the connection process to the network).  The video and audio quality far exceeded my expectations! The motion detection is good,  but not consistent. The night-vision is better than expected.  The zoom feature is the same as taking a picture on your phone & zooming in.  You are limited to the extent of the picture and it becomes grainy. The audio is very clear and decent range.  The talk feature is also clear and decent range. These little cameras def impress and offer a very affordable option,  allbeit a limited capabilities option.THE NOT SO GOOD:I am disappointed in the fact that other than a cloud subscription,  I am only able to view or save my videos for up to 60 days.  The two outdoor cameras can also be saved to a separately purchased usb drive that plugs into the module.  Beyond those options,  I have no way to view or save my videos from my indoor/outdoor cameras.  I am also disappointed that the app only let's you view live view for 30 seconds at  a time & not a continuous stream.  Also disappointing is that the app only let's you view streams one at a time,  rather than having a multi-panel view.  Unfortunately,  these issues are big shortcomings  in what I feel are important and fundamental functions & purpose of any camera system.Although these issues are big disappointments to me,  I am still happy with the overall capabilities and functions of these cameras at this price point.  Had I paid more than I did (thanks to Prime Days,  I got the whole lot,  6 cameras,  for about $160), I would have returned them,  due to their limited capabilities.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2021"
247,Tbird,There are no good cameras,"  I'm at a loss. We've had two different ""pet"" cameras for a similar cost, and while they've had their issues leading to me looking else where after a bit of use, Blink is just as bad in its own way.This one was for indoor use, and doorbell was for outdoor (less about the doorbell, more about finally having a camera that works at night) plus needing the sync module that came with it. I didn't want to get trapped in their subscription so I cancelled the trial immediately to know what it would look like with the sync module and local storage. It's kind of weird that it's a USB when, again, cheaper pet cameras have better SD card options but I'll take what I can get here to try. Plenty of people have covered how it's a ploy to get you to have their subscription that you can't record live view (ie, you get a notification about motion, watch it, someone's breaking into your house, but because you're watching it live it doesn't save) but I didn't get my cameras for notifications. We have too much street traffic for motion detection to matter.That being said, I do WANT motion detection. But the doorbell doesn't do this consistently for humans in the least, and the Mini won't stay connected to the internet long enough to watch even me walk inside. All the cars when I had the doorbell out front? Totally. The raccoon that walked two feet in front of it? Super delayed on when it started to record, but sure. When I walk in my own drive way? Nah. I have to be moving the camera to be recorded. I drove ALL THE WAY up my driveway (it's long) and it didn't start recording until my car was halfway in the garage. I get that some of the issue may have to do with ""battery saving"", but I feel like I'm asking for the bare minimum when it comes to proper recordings.The Wi-Fi connection also almost makes no sense to me, specifically for the Mini. The doorbell has worked on the front door, and on the garage which again is looong and quite a ways from the house. But the Mini? Works in one place in the house. And not even at the halfway point of what the doorbell works with. Even the cheapo pet cameras I mentioned had better Wi-fi connectivity in ALL the positions I tried in the house.I think the Mini probably has a chance of recording more consistently than the Doorbell, but the Doorbell is the one that stays connected to the Wi-fi. Like I'm considering using the doorbell inside when we go places (I literally haven't bothered mounting it with how much inconsistency there's been). But I really finally wanted something for outside, too.I'm tired. I'm not even someone totally needing this for feeling like our house is safe and yet it IS supposed to be a security system. For me it's more to keep an eye on neighbors who keep using our yard for stuff but I would really, really love something that works for peace of mind for the unknown, too. I just don't think that with all our technology, it exists for a reasonable cost.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2022"
248,KML,Very good for the price -  a few caveats,"  This camera will function well for me.  I do like the cloud service, but I don't think I will continue with it after the trial period is up.  I don't have high expectations for this camera, so keep in mind my ratings are me specific.  If you have higher expectations do more research to ensure these will work as you need.  I just wanted a cheap way to ensure if someone lurks around/breaks in, I have a chance at catching an image of who they are.A few things to think about:1. You must have working Wi-Fi with an Internet connection.  This sounds stupid, but my modem went out the other day, so I still had a working Wi-Fi network, but that is not good enough.  While my Hue lights still worked without working Internet, my Blink cameras did not.If you want hard core security cameras, these aren't going to be your best option. Someone could very easily kill your cameras without even having to go inside your house/business.2. While I haven't tried it yet, I believe your recordings go to the Blink servers even when you don't have a subscription.  They mention you can backup the clips set off by movement, but given it ""backs those clips up once daily by default"" to the thumb drive attached to the Sync Module 2, it must be temporarily storing those clips on their server (which is why you would need the Internet - See point 1 above).  So if it bothers you that Amazon will still have access to those clips, you may want to investigate other options.3.  Think about how where to install the cameras.  It actually does better when someone/something moves across the field of vision as per their instructions.  They are correct.  What I mean by this is imagine you are looking at a device screen.  It works best if the image moves across the screen from left to right or right to left.  Coming straight at the camera doesn't set it off as quickly as I would expect.  While the camera I have can see the sidewalk out by the street, I was practically at the door before it started recording.  So you have to think about how to get the motion detection to get the camera to start recording while at the same time having a good angle to get a good picture of a person's face.  -- I haven't tried to see if there are some sensitivity options to try to get the camera to go off sooner.4. They need to provide a longer cord.  I was going to install it to the ceiling to get the ""right"" angle to cover two doors close to one another.  Even if I went straight from the outlet to the ceiling, the cord isn't long enough to then mount to the ceiling.  Trying to get it to move into the corner was impossible.Again, I am going for low cost security.  I really just wanted to make sure no one is coming up to the door when we aren't around.  If I had great security concerns, I would keep exploring other options.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2021"
249,Salem,Room for improvement,"  I was under the impression I would be able to do a continuous viewing without having to press a button every 30 seconds. I want to be able to monitor my mother (who has Alzheimer’s) during the times of day when she is most active and more prone to falling but you have to keep hitting a “continue” button to keep the live feed going.  I was also unaware that there was a subscription, a paid subscription, after the trial. I don’t want to keep all of the videos necessarily but I would like to be able to save an occasional video to my phone or locally rather than in a cloud.  Mom says the darndest things sometimes and those would be videos that I would want to share with the family and have indefinitely.  The video quality is quite good as is the audio quality. And it was very easy to set it up. I was able to share the app with my daughter so she can also monitor her Nana even though she is in another state.  My daughter cried for joy knowing she could look in on Nana from time to time. So that’s wonderful! The notifications for the motion detector don’t always come through so one night my mom was yelling for me to come and help her and I got no notification that she was moving about and had no idea she had gotten herself up and was in the bathroom.  I purchase this security camera so that I would be secure in the knowledge that I would be notified when motion was detected in her room and that did not happen so I was quite disappointed with that.  So, yes, there is room for improvement.  I do hope there are some changes before the trial period is over or I am afraid I will have to find another solution to being able to monitor my mothers shenanigans.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2021"

It's only 3$ a month but still my wyze camera cost me less up front.  It is also more compatible with my other devices.  Wyze doesn't charge me a fee either and I can record and do live views.

252,Tanya McHenry,Only works when you have cell reception,"  Don’t waste your money on this. Garbage and I’m returning it.Bottom line, if someone knows you’re going to be away from your home and say, in airplane mode on a long flight, they can come into your home during that time and you’d be none the wiser because the Blink app will not record and store their movement while your cell phone is off line - and, won’t alert you when you’re back online/out of airplane mode. See below for more details.Wife and I bought it to secure our house while away on a hiking trip. We armed the camera when we left for our trip and pointed it directly at our door where all family/visitors always enter. Before leaving for our trip we did a few test runs with the camera in “armed” mode. It picked up our motion and recorded our movements each time without missing a beat.Fast forward, we leave for our trip out west with the camera armed. We were hiking in remote areas with no cell reception. When we returned into cell range, there were no alerts that any motion had been detected nor that anyone had been in our home. Wife then gets a text from her in laws that they’re at our house and have been there for a few hours. I check the Blink app and it says our camera is armed, yet no alerts re anyone entering our home - and, no videos of them entering our home. Then, about 5 mins after being in cell range the alerts on my Blink app start blowing up, but it’s all from current movement in my home not past movements when my family first came over and came through the door at which the camera is pointed.What good is a security camera when you have to have cell reception for it to actually record and send you alerts?! It should record and store even when you’re not in cell range and then save the videos and alert you when you come back in range. It doesn’t do that. Even the Canary (which we used to have and was marginal at best) would record videos and keep them stored and immediately alert you once you’re back in range that someone had been in your home.Again, don’t waste your money. Get a real alarm system from a legit company if you want something that works like it should and spend the $$$.

I can literally walk right up to the camera and it does not turn on smh but on some rare occasions it will turn on when walking from the kitchen to the livingroom before you can even see anything on the camera, so I know it can detect both movements and noise so it's just frustrating that it does not fully work to the best of its capabilities.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2020"

First is that there is a delay of about 5 seconds before the camera activates. By the time a burger sets off the camera they probably would not get a video of them. Second is the monthly fee. You get a free 31 day trial but, to actually store videos you will have to pay. Now, they DO NOT make clear what that fee is. I saw $79 but is that pere year or month. We looked at the Blink iutddor cameras. At $99 a piece with so many bad reviews, basically the same as the Blink indoor camera we passed. Without paying, you can sée a live stream but no recording.

I am currently on the free trial of the unlimited plan which I plan on purchasing. It includes unlimited cloud storage and saves the clips for 60 days.If the storage is unlimited, why is my clip length restricted to 30 seconds?! Why can't it just record until the detected motion stops? I have the reset time set as low as it goes but that is not helpful at all, as 10 seconds is more than enough time to miss something important happening.I googled and the clip length is apparently tied to the device, max for this unit being 30 seconds and 60 seconds for the larger models. I would gladly use my own storage space or clear out unneeded clips if there were no restriction on length. Crime and theft do not only happen in 30/60 second intervals, and they definitely do not take time to pause for 10 seconds to wait for this thing to reset and start recording again.I am happy with every other aspect of this purchase, but the 30 second clip restriction and 10 second reset time are ridiculous.

259,D. H. Lloyd,"OK daytime camera, 2nd morning, no detection","  I continue to be amazed at how bad this product really is. My friend bought one on sale. I warned her she should return it but it's just $20 so small loss. Amazing bad ui. Get a motion alert (many moths, etc) tap it a few hours later and it brings you to locked live view. Useless. Have to close the app, find it and Launch it to see the non events. Wyze on the other hand let's you get alerts only for people, if that's what you choose. Wyze will be pretty bad without service so plan on 15 to 20/yr per camera, but way less than blink for up to 5 cameras and their AI is actually good. Week 4. After spending hours corresponding with tech support and trying all kinds of stupid steps because their device simply doesn't work, I ordered a Wyze V3 to test it out. Set it up so it sees the same area. Turned off night mode so it uses its high gain color sensor and wow. What a difference. I'm not sure everything works correctly, but even if it doesn't, what does is better than this junk.Based on all camera reviews, I purchased $3 2 year warranty just in case.Camera quality - wyze, sound and speaker - blink, notification actual - wyze, notification sound - blink (probably setting for wyze), night camera - definitely wyze. Cost / yr for service - wyze @15 per vs blink at 36 per or 120 for bunch. Onboard recording - wyze.No service option. Neither. It seems like with both while the camera works without annual service, with blink you need sync module which probably also has technical problems since they seem incompetent, and with wyze, they clearly disclose many limitations on alerts, recording options, review options, etc. For the effort 1.50 to $2 / mo will be worth having full feature set.Region marking for detection wyze. Mounting and pointing - blink. I'll have to buy better mount for wyze to put it in a good location. Probably would have with blink to.Return - BLINK IS HORRIBLE. Wyze, I don't know and hope not to. With blink, because the product didn't work so I was returning it as defective, my choices were print a label. My printer stopped working. Or stay home from work to hand the $20 junk to ups. Amazon rep had difficulty with the detail, but when I typed in all caps that no one would be home for ups, is this OK? He went away for 5 min and just gave me my money back. OK, but I really would rather return it. Of course what's the point. It doesn't work, but it probably works as well as any other new part of this item because the problems are firmware/software.Night Vision horrible compared to Wyze V3, motion detection good when it works but non existent on transition from night to day. Picture quality OK but nowhere near wyze V3 quality.Week one.. We'll this is a bust. Tech support says. Check the early notification box. Nitwit. Is not that I don't get an early notification, it's that I get no notification, recording, etc.Basically, the camera ceases to function until I access it with the app. Seems to only happen overnight. I'll bet it has something to do with night to day transition or update check, but it's basically worthless without a Reliable detection function.Also getting late night recordings where the first 5 seconds have audio but no video. I suspect it's a prerecord feature where the light is not on until motion is detected. I like that it prerecords.Day3: tested yesterday evening and night before bed, picked up motion no problem. Walked out front door this am and nothing again. Gave it a minute. Checked app, test again nothing. Live view, lock phone, test and it picks up.Seems like you have to live view to reset which is DEFINITELY not acceptable.Day2;I have it set up so it catches my front door. Worked great first day, second morning I walked past 3 times and it occurred to me I didn't get notified. Checked, everything correct. Searched problem, apparently app is still crap.

Setting them up was fairly simple although one camera gave me some grief and i had to have my phone connect directly to the camera to get it to connect to the wifi network.  The app was somewhat helpful in guiding me through that.  The only improvement I would want is that the maximum video clip recording time is only 30 seconds and I wish it could be up to 90 seconds.

261,Z.,It is NOT a security camera !,"  1- Motion Detection:Forget about night vision; objects (human/etc) have to move too close (2-5 ft) to the camera, then MAYBE a motion detection alert gets triggered! It turned out that the motion detection capability is totally unreliable in darkness. It is better in daylight, however, it still suffers from detection objects that are small (or far in the frame).2- Image and Sound Quality:Push-to-talk option works nice with minimal delay. Camera speaker plays human voice with an acceptable quality. The other direction, however, doesn't seem pleasant. Camera's microphone grabs all background noises (cars/refrigerator/machines/etc), amplifies them and delivers all horrible noises when you are watching the live view on your phone app. If someone is speaking next to the camera, then, you might have issues hearing them. Image quality would be fine if you don't expect you project the app screen on a 40"" display!App and subscription:App is user friendly. One-time perspective setup and all is set!

262,SFG,I wasted my money on a Blink camera system,"  Over the course of five weeks - June to July, 2021 - I bought 13 Blink cameras - 7 wired Blink Mini cameras, 6 outdoor wireless, and two sync modules, all connected to the same router, 8 cameras on one Sync module and 5 on the other Sync module.First, the good: Installation was easy, set-up was relatively easy, picture quality and audio are decent, and it is helpful to be able to block out certain ""Activity zones"" on individual cameras. It's also helpful to be able to set a schedule for arming and disarming either system, and to be able to disable individual cameras while the rest of that system is armed. The app is fairly intuitive and provides a fair amount of control of individual cameras.Here's the not-so-good: All cameras except two outdoor wireless are between 15 and 40 feet of a high-quality router with a great signal, the other two are about 50' and 75' away. All cameras, even the one 75' away, show excellent Wi-Fi signal strength and excellent Sync Module strength. It often takes several tries to get a live view and more often than not I get ""Live view failed"" on random cameras. I also occasionally get ""Camera off line"" on any of the plug-in Mini cameras, though they almost always come back on line by themselves - sometimes within a few minutes, sometimes after a day or so off line. I have ""Early Notification"" enabled, but when I get notified of a camera detecting motion, it always takes several seconds before I can get a live view, and more often than not, I get ""Live view unavailable"". When I switch from one camera view to another, it takes several tries  before the ""Live view in progress - Please wait"" message goes away and I can get to the other camera - ten seconds or more. The minimum ten second re-trigger time could mean that that camera misses something important. I'm also disappointed that the battery level on the outdoor cameras only says ""Ok"", but doesn't actually give any indication of actual battery level.I'm really sorry I went with Blink. I'm considering just taking a loss on the $600 I've spent so far and switching to a more reliable system.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2021"
263,whitebirch,Good camera but some issues,"  I bought this for a small one bedroom apartment. It’s facing the front door in the living room. When inside the apartment, it does a good job of tracking movement. My issue is that it doesn’t detect motion when the door opens. It doesn’t detect motion when I come inside my apartment. I have to be in my apartment for 5-10 seconds before it picks up the movement. I think this is a major flaw. If someone were to enter my apartment, the camera wouldn’t catch them actually coming in. It will only show them as if they were already inside. I can stand in front of the door and move around, and the camera will detect that motion, so I’m not sure why the problem is.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2021"
264,Miggy,"Only detects light, not movement. Subscription is expensive.","  If you have motion-detecting lights and point this camera at that area, it could work very well. I live on a busy road with a sidewalk and this camera had a very hard time picking up people walking by at night under a street lamp, but any tiny change in shadows or light it picked up right away. During the day, it worked fine. I would not recommend this if you plan on pointing it somewhere darker or anywhere with cars/light changes. If you have a driveway with a motion-detecting light or plan on only using this during the day I think it would work very well.Be aware, once the free trial period ends, you will not be able to use this at all. It will not work without a subscription. It won't turn on the camera at all.

265,Lady D,DO NOT BUY,"  Amazon sold me blink cameras in May 2020. Now, over a year later, Amazon and Blink are trying to strong arm their customers into paying a subscription fee when that was not disclosed at time of purchase. Unless I pay the fee that was never agreed to, the system, over a $200 value, is now useless to me. I find it borderline criminal that a company would initiate a new policy for existing customers and force payment to use the previously purchased equipment.

TRUE STORY: I had this in my garage to record Amazon zkey deliveries. A paint chip (probably paint and seam tape) came off of my ceiling at 3am in my pitch black garage.

267,Karol,WiFi Keeps Dropping g,"  Update: Amazon contacted me shortly after the posting of this review and guided me on how to fix the issue. I updated the firmware, unplugged and plugged the camera, then reset the camera. That did the job. After the issue was resolved, I updated from 1 star to 4 stars. I think it should be more 3.5 stars but I’ll round up. I do wish the videos can be longer than 30 secs. I do experience connection issues while viewing lives. Audio and video quality can be better. But considering the price, I think it is acceptable.I got this for a remote location. I’ve had it for few weeks now. In the last week, the mini kept disconnecting from the WiFi and in order to reconnect I need to reset the camera in person to pair with the WiFi. So this disconnection issue renders the camera unless. It’s not a power issue because the camera is on when I get to the location and the other blink 2 camera and sync at the same location never stopped working.I really wished to like this camera because it’s located in a high traffic area and battery operated blinks were draining batteries in a week or two. The mini was supposed to be a solution. Hopefully, there is a firmware fix SOON but, otherwise, I will return this product.If this product doesn’t disconnect, there are things that I like about it.ProsNot powered by outletTwo way speakerfree storage with my existing accountLocal storage w/micro cardhalf decent imageReasonable priceConsNo continuous live view (I can watch it for about 5 mins and it’ll kick me off and I will need to wait seconds before I can jump back on)Disconnecting from WIFIBOTTOM LINE: This product is useless and unable to provide security because it disconnects frequently.

268,SugeS,Great value at a low price,  Excellent picture quality. I bought this camera specifically to use inside and point it outside through the window. There are several things you’ll need to Using it to point out the window. First you will need to turn off the blue light that comes on when motion is detected because it will cause a glare in the window at night that you won’t be able to see through. And second you’ll need to turn off the night vision control because this will make the blue light come on causing a severe glare that you won’t be able to see through. I also set the IR intensity to high to help detect motion at night. So far so good.

(That was before I knew that I had to pay a monthly fee for it to work well.) What they don't make clear until I called to ask,  is that you must pay a monthly fee for cloud space in order for this camera to work well. It was fantastic while on the cloud but once I started to use the thumb drive it was awful. Sometimes it recorder and some times nothing shows up at all with no reason. Someone walking up to my front door should set it off easily, but it doesn't seem too. .Very disappointing.

If you want continuous monitoring or recording I would suggest to look elsewhere as you have to continue pressing ""continue?"" button after a minute or so.

Not sure what happened but camera itself crashed flashing series of green and 1 red pulses on the cam.

273,Kelly,Not quite ready for duty,"  Last update 1/6/2022The basic job of this camera is to detect motion 24 x 7.When it works, it works well.(I wish the Blink outdoor ones are like that capturing motion a few seconds before it starts (at least when plugged in).)Video is clear.Microphone seems to pick up sound pretty well.I would have given this camera at least a 4 stars if not because of a day one bug that is still hauntingthe users despite support said they are working on a fix with no ETA.My camera firmware version is 9.74.Still no fix in sight as of this review revision.It seems like the camera just failed to match the exposure to the environment at all times.When the camera experience a transition from dark to bright, it failed to adjust its exposure (thus over exposed) and missed most motion until it gets dark again.If you wave your hand very close to the camera, you may get the camera to work again as the camera will adjust its exposure to the environment once motion is detected.The suggested workaround by Blink is to disable/enable the camera daily after dawn.  That adds another 15 mins of uncertainty.This workaround doesn't really solve scenarios at night though.If I keep a light on for the camera at night so that it doesn't adjust its exposure too much, that seems to help.If the camera experience more motions during the night to day transition, it seems to help.If I am using the camera in an always dark environment so that IR mode is always on, that seems to work too.Need to test these workarounds for a longer period of time to know for sure.BLINK, PLEASE FIX THIS ASAP!No reason customer has to waste their time to figure out how to work around a day one defect.The Activity Zones setting is pretty coarse like the XT instead of XT2.Each motion video can be recorded between 5 and 30 seconds.Live view on phone app will pause every 60 seconds.I also ran into random minor issues once in a while:1) Camera setting is not in sync with the app settings.2) Recorded clip is not the specified length without changing anything.3) Playback progress bar is out of sync with the video.4) First playback seems to take quite some time before it can start.5) Notification of motion can be a min or two behind.  Typically it only takes 2-3 seconds if early notification is on.Some of the above can be related to the day one bug.Would be useful to have the following:1) Allow retrigger time to be set to zero so there is no additional uncertainty.2) Time stamp on the video.2) Report number of times a camera failed to notify motion due to intermittent communication issues.3) Continuous live view as an option even in the Blink outdoor case (at the expense of battery life).4) Skip notification for individual camera but continue to detect and record motion.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2020"

The night vision is very clear, it even detects dust.  The audio is very nice, we have startled a few people.  The lights on the devices are not bothersome.  It is nice to see when the cameras are armed and when they pick something up. Being able to have the living room camera on and the bedroom camera off is a plus or visa versa.  The camera controls work decently with alexa.  We have had a couple of issues with Alexa not understanding the alarm command, however, it is very easy to arm and disarm through the aps on the phones.  Being able to control the settings of the cameras is great through the ap.  The video record time is perfect for our needs.  Instillation was quick and painless.  Only down fall is if the power goes out, because these cameras are directly plugged into an outlet.  We have not experienced that yet.

276,B. Sands,Product is Junk; Service is horrendous,"  Initially, I stated that the product is fairly intuitive (see also below). Good thing, because if you call their customer support department, you wait for an agent, only to be told that you have to leave a message.  When you leave your contact info, they don't return the call within 24 hours.  Not acceptable, in my opinionGoing back to the product, it is fairly simple to set up and works OK if nothing goes wrong.  However, if there is an outage, you need to visit the physical device to get it going again.  If you are using Blink to protect your remote property, you are screwed big time as there is nothing you can do remotely to get your cameras running again short of visiting the location and taking some hands-on action.More recently, I had an experience where my son walked through our house, waving his arms at both cameras.  They did not detect any motion.  Really?  I sent an email to Blink Customer Service - there is no sense in calling because they don't answer the phone or return calls - but no response.

I purchased 2 Blink Minis and a blink sync module 2 and the cameras worked great until the trial plan ran out. Now the clips take a long time to load even on the same network as the sync module. There is no reason for this, the clips on my other cheap camera load instantly. I used to be able to delete multiple clips at once without having to start a video first. Now I have to wait a while for a clip to start 1 at a time before I can delete them.  If you have one of these cameras in a high-traffic area, you will be spending hours every day deleting clips. Amazon really hosed this camera in order to try and shove a subscription plan down my throat. There is no other reason for the clips to take a long time to load at home and preventing multiple clips from being deleted at once. I was planning on buying the three pack Blink outdoor camera kit. I am soooooooo glad that I waited.Edit: Gone from bad to total JUNK. Now the camera captures motion maybe 1 out of 5 times.

Currently it is near the garage door with sensitivity set to the maximum in the app. It almost never detects motion. The “mini” uses changes in pixels rather than infrared detection. When the garage door opens, it should “see” 1) a sudden brightening, which would affect every pixel in the image; 2) the horizontal lines of the garage door segments moving up across the image; 3) the dark colored car backing out or driving in, creating a huge contrast in well over half of the pixels in the frame; 4) a delivery person walking into the garage (after it should have already activated due to the door opening) and setting a package down right below the camera — TWICE — having stepped directly in front of the camera. Yet the Mini usually does not detect the motion. I even made stripes on the garage door using electrical tape in order to increase the contrast. Nothing!

During the day the picture quality is decent enough that I can recognize who is coming to my door. HOWEVER. The night vision is absolutely terrible!! No matter how I adjust the settings the quality is the same. I even took the camera down and placed it outside to see if the glass pane was causing the problem with the quality but it is just BAD night vision.If you’re using this as some sort of nanny cam or only need to see things during the day it is passable— but for security or peace of mind at night I definitely would not recommend it.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2021"

I have all brand new 12/21 devices. A Doorbell, two outdoor cams, two sync 2 modules, and 3 indoor cams. The nightvision on the outdoor is meh, it works, but it's not great. Plants reflect a lot of the IR and makes it hard to see past the reflection. It's battery powered, so what do you want? Overall I would say I like the Blink system, but my headline is my number one gripe. I bought this expecting that I would be able to record to the USB drive connected to the sync 2 module for free. THIS IS NOT THE CASE. You MUST pay for a subscription plan to record. There is a free plan, but that only includes live view, and motion ALERTS. NO RECORDING. Doesn't matter if you have the sync module with a USB drive or not, all new cameras must have a subscription plan to record. 10 bucks a month for unlimited cameras. I don't know if it's worth it honestly. The motion detection doesn't really put it in that subscription price range for me. I would rather have one of the actual alarm options out there for around the same price.  I probably will just stick with the free plan, or I may even return them. I'm not sure yet.

We bought it to keep an eye on the parking lot in front of our apartment, only to find out that it won't work through glass. We settled for having it pointed at the front door. It was constantly using ""night vision"" when there was plenty of light in the room, making the image extremely bright. The TV was constantly triggering the camera whenever there was a bright flash. Several times, the camera quit responding to the app. The last time it stopped responding, I just unplugged it. I'm glad I bought it on sale, at least.Edit 12/4/20: I turned off night vision, and it now works through windows when it wants to. The camera will stop working for hours at a time, and only starts working again once someone uses live view to ""wake it up"". This makes it completely useless as a security camera.We also discovered that the speaker has a terrible feedback squeal, which makes that part of the camera also useless. From other reviews I have read, there is no fix for this.

288,Lee,Not bad for the price,"  I bought a set of 3 Blink mini cameras.Mostly to keep an eye on the dogs while my wife and I are away and also for security.They work pretty well but when you are away from home and try to talk to someone through the camera the voice that comes out is horribly distorted and difficult if not impossible to understand.The wife and I had been out for a few hours and I went on “Live” video and told my yellow lab to vacuum the carpet and she clearly didn’t understand. 🤔Just kidding about that, however, it really is horrible quality audio that comes out of the speakers.I let the free Blink storage expire just to see if it was actually something that I needed and quickly paid the $100 for a one year subscription.Without the subscription it would notify me of movement but I couldn’t go back and see what the movement was that was detected.They have some type of hub that you can buy for your home that also provides that capability but if I was a burglar I’d just destroy the micro SD card and steal the whole system.Overall it serves the purpose at a reasonable price.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2021"

291,Folira,Not for Security!!,"  I got this little camera for free, so I really can't complain about anything. But, I have some of the same complaints as everyone else. My main problem is the motion detection when armed. It just stops, or doesn't work at all. I have tried adjusting the sensitivity and it still doesn't work. I can be walking around the living room and nothing. It seems to work ok in the daylight, and occasionally at night... But definitely not the way it should, so it should not be trusted as security camera. You would also think that you would have more options with Alexa. It doesn't have any option to arm/disarm automatically when you leave home or come back... Which akexa doesn't seem to work for that with the other things, anyway, but that's for a different item.Other than those things, it seems like it has the potential to be a really good little camera. Picture looks good, especially at night with the night vision.Once they get some of these bugs worked out, it will really be worth it... Especially at the price point.If you just want to have the option to look in on a room or something from time to time, this would be ok for that. Just not for security.

294,AI,Terrible. Hit and miss recording.  Forces you to buy plan,"  I thought these were great when I first purchased it.  But then noticed that it wasn’t recording motion when I needed it the most.  I set these up at my office to record motion in the parking lot.  The cameras stopped recording about 7pm and didn’t start again until about 9am.  Meanwhile dozens of cars and people went by the view of the camera.  I worked with support for days, tons of emails, and they couldn’t figure it out. They even sent me two new cameras, I had to send the two older ones back. Same problem.  They couldn’t fix it.  AND to kick me when I was down, they changed their policy from free recording to requiring a plan.  I had free recording when I first got the cameras. That’s why I bought them!  It lasted for about six months so it wasn’t just that I ‘misunderstood’ a 30 day free trial. Then I started getting emails that I needed to purchase a plan.  I purchased a plan for one of the six cameras, just to test it.  Maybe this would fix the software issue that caused it to stop recording for hours at a time.  Nope.  Still useless.

295,Sean,Bad picture buggy software,"  I'm really disappointed with the current state of indoor Wifi cameras. I've had a lot of Wyze cameras but they're pretty useless without their Cam Plus subscription. I sent them back because of that. Next I tried the Eufy cameras because they say they work with local storage and no subscriptions required.  The problem with them is the horrible software and buggy motion detection.I tried these Blink cameras next. They had the worst picture of the three. It's very low contrast and washed out looking. It's obvious they're using the cheapest sensor they can get. The software is also poorly designed and hard to use.  The settings for motion detection are ""how long should it record"" (max 60 seconds) and ""how long should it wait to record again"". What I want it to do is start recording when it sees motion and keep recording until the motion stops.  That's not one of the options.The final problem was the motion detection itself. It would miss big things or start recording in the middle.  For example, the start of the recording would show the cat in the middle of the room with no  recording of the cat actually entering.I can't believe that these cameras are so badly programmed and user unfriendly. It's like all these companies are just shoveling crap out the door without ever actually trying to use it.  That's not quite the case for Wyze. Their software works ok. They just want you to keep paying for it forever so they disable basic functions unless you buy a subscription.Update: 2021-10-18.  Blink support reached out to try and help with my issues.  I appreciate that they're at least trying.  Still, it should have worked without messing around with settings for something as basic as motion detection.

297,Mei,"The Good, The bad, and The ugly night time video.",  Like all the blink cameras I’ve owned the picture is good enough to see what is going on in front of the camera but it’s not very good at night.  Blurry is an understatement which is really bad considering I wanted these cameras for proof or help identifying criminals in case one decides to break into my property or vehicles.  You can change every setting on the app and update the cameras but it will never be a crisp bright night vision image or video.  I’ve accepted the fact that this is merely eyes to the outside while you’re asleep or away from home and that’s pretty much it.  This new mini has a delay when you try to speak to the person on the other end it will mute your sound for a few seconds while you finish talking then you can see the person talking then a few seconds later the sound comes through.  It also started making a loud popping noise when you have the sound muted on the app just as soon as you close the live camera feed.  That could just be a problem with the app but I’m not certain what is causing that noise. The notification sometimes works when movement is detected but it’s usually 60/40 that it will work fast enough to allow you to answer the doorbell when someone shows up and sets it off.  All in all if you just want to see what is going on in and out of your home while your away this works fine but if you want good quality video both day AND night then this is not for you.

The only way to reconnect is to delete the system in the app, reset the camera by pushing the micro button at the bottom, and start completely over. It’s more trouble than it’s worth.

303,AC,"It's a pretty good system so far, but has some drawbacks...","  (I may adjust this review, as I have had the product for only a week now) I bought this system to use in a giant room that we use at our church. I wanted to try it out as I had been using the Yi camera system throughout the kids building (it's a 70k square foot building). The picture quality is great! The biggest issue I see is that I can't watch the camera live, if there is motion in the room. I liked on the Yi cameras, that I could watch it live, and rewind it in real time (like a dvr). I haven't figured out how to do it with Blink camera yet. I have the Sync Module 2, with the biggest USB it can handle, and have a VERY strong Wifi throughout the building. The problem is, when I go live, if there are people in the room, it will tell me ""live view failed"". It takes short clips (I've changed the settings to make them longer, but they still aren't very long), and I'm afraid I'm going to miss something important in the room (it's for child safety and other issues).I'll give it a few more weeks before I return back to the Yi cameras.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2021"

305,love to read,Probably the best out there,"  Got it during Prime Day, it was a good deal and got shipped quickly despite initially being back-ordered. Have bought and tried a few such cameras, I would say Blink cameras are the best out there, for many reasons.First, It is such an easy thing to set it up that there is not even an user manual included. Simply follow the 3 step instructions on the packaging and get started for set up, which took like less than 5 minutes. Everything was a breeze from there. Motion detection is super sensitive, even though it is for indoor use, I used it to point outside for outdoor monitoring, it was able to detect motion when people approach my place or when a neighbor's car comes and goes and it records video when it happens. There is no internal local storage and you can purchase cloud storage, but it's not really needed, as video clips can be stored on your phone with the app, and you can upload/download it elsewhere.It's mini and compact, night vision works well, picture quality is fine.

306,S. Hooper,Not for security,"  I really wanted to love these cameras.  I have several cameras I have used over the years much cheaper than these that have a ton not featured than these do.  I will give some pros though.  They have an excellent angle view and the video and audio is great.  But that's about it.  The app is clunky and the most important part, the video does NOT overlay the timestamp.  In some legal cases, this makes the video useless.  The stamp on the file can easily be manipulated and in a recent case down here, the video was thrown out.  Please review the Blink website for people complaining about this since 2017.  I have a cheap Zmodo home security system. I have $15 dangers from Foscam and similar generics.  Guess what, overlay time stamp on every one. This is not a complicated thing to do.  Finally, you can not stream this video constantly. Any other system allows this. Not sure why Blink decided to limit sessions to a few minutes.  DO NOT USE THIS AS A NURSERY MONITOR... That would be extremely dangerous.  The storage is decent, so it holds a lot of clips  but again, there should have been an option for clips to run while there is motion and not just 30 seconds when motion is detected.  My kids were fighting and it just happened to end the recording and start the next after a delay when he hit his brother. Nope, not recorded.  However, my cheap camera did, so thank goodness. After 30 seconds (maximum time it will record a clip). It makes you wait a minimum of 10 seconds before it even picks back up.  Blink, you are almost there.

The camera image is fine and unlike the battery powered units you can watch as long as you need to.  That was important to me.  The audio to me is also of good quality.  Five stars for that.Now the bad.....Using the ""talk"" feature results in a ton of screeching and static.  I suppose it ""could"" be feedback but the noise remains even if I move to distant areas of the house.  I will need to have someone else try to ""talk"" from farther away while I wat in the house and see if the problem persists from a greater distance.  For now the ""talk"" feature gets 1 star and drags the overall review down to three stars.

308,Evan B.,Big flaws on main features,"  The cameras are super easy to get set up and the picture quality is pretty good. The features go downhill from there. One big issue is the live view. I like to have a continuous stream of live view at certain times to keep an eye on pets and things. This makes you click continue every 30 seconds or so or else it turns off. It also makes it so you can't access the live view again for a short time as it says there's still one active. Another issue, it seems to be random on when it detects things and when it doesn't. It started out working fine, but now never seems to catch everything. As I write this, I just had someone show up and get all the way into my kitchen, bypassing two active cameras that never alerted me. I've toyed with all the settings to make them more sensitive, tried the ""early notice"" feature that's supposed to alert you faster. These come off really great but are in fact much worse than you'd expect.

Stay aware. Makes me not want to keep this product!EDIT 2: after nearly 6 months, I am increasingly annoyed with this camera and wish I had just spent $70-$100 for something of higher quality. The constant notifications I get during sun up and sun down due to the IR light changing constantly and thinking there is motion is absurdly annoying.The camera is small, easy to mount, and very easy to set up. less than 5 minutes to have it working. Overall, would recommend this as a camera that faces an entry/ exit door.Pros: Small, attractive, cheap, easy, good app, 2-way communication is LOUD, night vision works great from 6 feet, no problems recording, instant notifications.Cons: Motion detection is VERY sensitive (shadows, lights turning on/off, 4lb cat), can't be ""always-on"" as described unless you literally always have the app open, and the cord is ~1 meter, limiting where I can plug it in while it's wall-mounted.Yes, it will always start recording if you have it in the ""Armed"" setting and it detects motion, but it will not be always recording without motion.Additionally, there is no middle ground with the sensitivity settings. on a 3, it won't pick up me standing in front of it waving my arms, but on a 4, it picks up the smallest shadow.Overall, I am keeping the camera as it was only $35.

310,Gerard Belanger,Can’t recommend based on quality and consistency!,"  Just for a little background info before I give my pros and cons… We have 8 cameras total (3 outdoor and 5 indoor minis). We have them all set up on the same system saving to the sync device that is at a good middle spot in the house by our router and also have the WiFi extended to reach every corner of the 1/2 acre we live on by using an Orbi system. We placed the three cameras in the front of the house and then the inside ones we placed strategically thought the house.Pros: 1. Easy setup: for the most part it was downloading an app and plugging in the indoor cameras and putting batteries in the outdoor ones. Then you scan the QR code and your ready to go.2. Picture quality is pretty good: It automatically switches to night vision when it gets too dark and I can adjust IR intensity to allow the picture quality I want at night. The daytime picture is pretty good up close but you couldn’t use it to see like the license plate of the cars driving by or anything detailed more than a 5-10 feet from the camera.3. You can talk and hear through the cameras: This is a plus but the quality is severely lacking in this area. You can’t talk and hear what they are saying at the same time and when they talk or you talk it seems to cut in and out quite a bit so you miss some of what is said. It is also delayed by at least 3-4 seconds from when it is actually being said to when you hear it on the app.4. The price is good for a starter security system or if you aren’t wanting to pay a lot but still want to catch a burglar or make sure your packages are being delivered properly.5. You can add on cameras if you need more but beware because the sync device doesn’t seem to like to record and save what is happening on more than one camera at a time so if a bird flies by one camera your probably not going to catch the person walking up to your porch on the other camera (or at least not until they are actually on your porch).Cons: 1. Battery life depends on usage which means with heavy winds moving the top of our trees causing the shadows to sway and then the bees and birds that seem to love setting our cameras off we have now replaced the batteries at least once in each of the three outdoor cameras and one of the cameras seems to need replaced each month. You can change the sensitivity setting to help stop some of that but it seems like we didn’t pick up anything including people walking around outside when we went down a setting or two so be prepared to replace a bunch of lithium batteries or not catch what’s happening.2. As I mentioned above the ability to talk to whoever is on the other side of the camera(or just listen in) is lacking quality and consistency!3. The app takes too long to pull up and then you can’t smoothly switch between camera live views(it gives an error message or says the camera is busy) so if you are trying to check in on each camera your either out of luck or will have to close completely out of the app and get back in to try and see the next cameras live view.4. The inconsistent recording is extremely frustrating!! Some days it will alert me to a fly buzzing past or the mailman putting mail in our box, other days though it won’t catch half of what is going on or it will catch it on one camera showing one angle but not on the other one which should have a clearer view of whatever action is happening.5. The Sync module has a spot for a usb memory drive but their blink usb drive filled up way too fast and the other few I tried didn’t seem to record the videos correctly so we couldn’t pull them up on a computer later. Your only other option is to pay each month for the cloud storage that they offer which will allow you to keep unlimited videos for up to 60days.6. Randomly the outdoor cameras will disconnect to my Orbi satellite or router even though they are within feet of them but the indoor cameras will stay connected. I end up having to take the outdoor ones down from where they are mounted and taking the batteries out for a few seconds to get it to reconnect. This is a pain since the cameras are hard to snap back onto the bracket they come with that is permanently attached to the house now.7. Although I put the LED recording status light to off on all the cameras it still comes on whenever it is recording. That’s frustrating when I’m trying to check in on the house and they hear a click and see a red light and know they are being recorded or we are watching.8. Although it has where you can set up a timer for your system to become active or inactive, you have to have all the cameras that are connected to the sync module go with that timer and can’t keep certain ones active all the time with the timer unless you put them on a different system and get another sync module.So basically they are a cheap starter system for someone wanting the basics and not looking for super consistent recording. I wish they were better because we would have added to the cameras we have now but with all the app problems and recording problems we will be finding a different (probably pricier) system to replace these cameras.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2021"

Night vision is grainy and easily washed out with the smallest amount of light. You can only view one camera at a time in the app and takes too long to connect and bring up the picture.

Unfortunatley it's missing at least 2 key features and 1 compatibility concern. First geofencing. I don't want this to record when we are home. You can't set up geofencing to turn on recording when you leave a certain area like, when you leave home. You could on the Cloud Cam. You have to manually ""arm / disarm"" to achieve this- very inconvenient...and scheduling is not the answer. Secondly, there is no snapshot preview when you log into the app. you have to manually take a snapshot to have something to show up when you first log in and that snapshot remains on screen until you take another one or start to stream video. Sometimes all you want to do is log in, see an updated snaphot and decide if you want start streaming video. Thirdly, the Amazon cloud cams cannot be imported into the Blink app forcing you to keep 2 apps- 1 for the cloud cam, and another for the Blink cameras and pay 2 fees for recordings.

314,Tyler Clark,Only can use it with a blink plan,"  Can't take screen shots, can't record. Unless you purchase a blink plan the camera is basically worthless. Thankfully there are other security camera manufacturers that aren't as greedy as Amazon. I would not recommend this camera unless you're all in on a blink camera plan and want to pay them to take screen shots and record anything to your phone. If not try Heimvision cameras. They don't force you to pay for the plan in order to use your camera. Other than that the camera seems to function fine, although I'm not entirely sure since I can't use most of the functions without purchasing a monthly blink plan.

315,Tyler Clark,Doesn't pick up motion half the time (with sensitivity turned up to highest setting),"  The picture quality is pretty good when it actually picks up motion. It'll pick up the weirdest things but not someone walking right in front of it. I have 3 of these cameras throughout the house. There are days where it picks up every little movement (like a shadow from a tree moving outside or even a piece of dust floating around) and other days where I can literally walk in front of all 3 cameras and none of them detect motion/record anything - today is one of those days. I just paid for the year subscription for all 3 but now wishing I would have returned them for a better detecting camera before I committed to that.Also - please please somehow fix the fact that I can't hear what someone is saying in front of the camera while I'm talking on the app. I like that I have to hold the talk button to be able to talk but if they start talking while I'm talking, I can't hear a word they're saying and the delay from releasing the ""talk button"" on the app to when I can finally hear what they're saying again is too much.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2021"
316,JD,"Good little camera, loud clicking when using night vision","  The cameras work very well, no complaints there.The issue is the very loud clicking when the IR filter turns on for the night vision. It's the same for all the blink cameras (I have 2 blink outdoor cams also) with night vision though, and most other competing cameras that I've found. I can't use this to watch my child and make sure they are asleep due to the loudness of the clicking.From my understanding this is due to the physical night vision filter on the camera sliding into place.If this is near you the clicking is very distracting and drowns out the first second or two of the audio in the recordings as well.Not a great thing to have on a security camera but seems to be an issue for more than just blink cameras.Overall camera works well and I've had no issues.I'm also using local storage and that works well. however when the ""free trial"" of their cloud stuff goes away in January 2021 we'll see how the app and recording work with only the local storage.Will update my review then.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2020"
317,Zack,Good cameras when on sale with limitations.,"  Got 4 of these when on sale. They are meant to be used indoors and require being plugged in with the typical usb adapter. I use a couple of these pointed out a window and they are OK. The motion detection works well through a window but the night vision does not as it just reflects on the window. I realize this is not what they were meant to be used for so not a complaint. If you use them this way, be sure to shut off the red light (through the app) that comes on when camera is active or it just blows out the picture. Many settings are available on the Blink app including zone blocking where you can have the cameras not sense motion in certain areas. Great feature to reduce false activation from things like blowing tree limbs. WiFi is excellent. I have one in a shed in my backyard and one in my camper at the top of my driveway. Both are 30-40 feet away from my WiFi hub and in different buildings and work flawlessly. Very easy setup. Just scan the code on the camera with your phone and they set themselves up.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2021"
318,Erica Caplinger,"Not that great, app is terrible and No subscription is a lie.","  Please note when I bought these the big part of Blink was they did not require a subscription to store video or do a host of other things. This has since changed and now they charge $30 a year. This is not a big deal but in comparison with other systems and subscription plans out there these are expensive for the cheap cameras they are. Before the subscription change I would have given it 4 stars. Now I have to evaluate them with the security cameras and plans they are now in league with on price.I actually have owned several types of cameras now in the process of finding what I like.ProsNot a lot of pros as they are cheap cameras. They were made to be Amazon's affordable version of Ring.1.) Microphone works well2.) Like Ring the camera starts recording right before the motion occurs so that's cool but you have to have a subscription now to view it.ConsLots of Cons that were not a big deal back when they didnt charge for storage.1.) Camera Image is not high quality especially in night vision. For the price you pay you can have better2.) The app is horrific to use. You can not steam more than 20-30 seconds, you can not stream multiple cameras at a time and I was never able to get it to work on the computer without some sort of emulator. I believe they have removed desktop monitoring at this point all together. (I recognize there is a Chrome Extension App but I have never used it as it is not published by Blink but a 3rd party and has 0 reviews.)Additionally I have amazing wifi both at work and home and pretty good phone processor. This app is just slow particularly considering that when you need to access it, the situation probably requires a quick response.3.) Speaker is not that great if that is something you care about.4.) Not as compatible with Alexa as they would like you to believe. Not saying they dont recognize each other, they just have a hard time playing together and it never seems to get updated.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2021"

320,Stay-C,"Buggy, video fails constantly","  Edited 4/1. After having this a few months as a baby monitor, it is ultra frustrating. The video constantly fails mid stream and when you try to reopen, it says system busy. It fails nearly every time we view which is every night. I would guess 1 out of 4 times does it actually work. Super frustrating waiting for the whole app to load once the live view fails. I would return if there were other options that worked with our xfinity router. We've never had a problem with the outdoor cameras on the rest of the blink system, but this one is a pass. Might be fine for emergency motion detection,  but I would not recommend for live view use unless a last resort.When we switched internet providers we had a really hard time finding a new video monitor that was compatible with Xfinity. For $35, this was a fantastic find. Works perfectly to view our kiddo's room. We already have a blink outdoor system and this installed effortlessly. We dont use motion detection or recording features on this one. Just want to be able to live stream after we put her to bed.

322,Patrick Meyer,Great addition to existing Blink System,"  Update:I originally had some concerns regarding the scheduling capability of this new Blink camera. Less than 24 hours after I wrote my review, a representative from the Blink Technical Support Team contacted me to address my concerns. Apparently you can set different schedules for the camera, however they need to be added as a “new system” instead of being added to my existing system. This allows me to create a separate schedule for the blink mini cameras. It was a quick and easy fix. Now wondering if I’m going to incur a monthly charge because of the changes I made. Will update again once blink reaches out to me.Also: New customers will have the option of purchasing the blink module 2 with storage capabilities (using a flash drive) if you don’t want to be charged monthly to use the cloud storage.Original Review:I already own 3 Blink XT2 cameras which have been working great for the outside of my home. Once I saw Amazon offering these new cameras that could be plugged into an outlet, I decided to purchase one for indoors.The video quality is excellent, audio is awesome, and the quality of the material used to manufacture the camera is decent. Unboxing and setup was a breeze (however that is to be expected when you already own existing blink products).I just have one complaint tho, and in my opinion, it’s a pretty big deal. The blink software doesn’t allow me to program a separate schedule for this indoor camera. I was hoping to record the inside of my home during the day when I’m not there. I currently limit my outdoor blink cameras to only record during the night time because I’m trying to conserve some battery life on the XT2 cameras. If I had them recording 24/7, I’m almost positive that my batteries won’t last 3 months, or anywhere near the advertised “up to 2 years”. So basically, if I want to record the inside of my home during the day, ALL of my cameras will be recording.I realize that I can just purchase another sync module and my problem would be fixed. It just sucks that I have to purchase more equipment now because of a lack of features for the scheduling options within the Blink app. This is something that could easily be addressed with a software update.I really wanted to give this product 5 stars, but until they do something about the scheduling options in the blink app, this review will stay at 3 stars. I sure hope somebody from the blink support team reads this review and does something about it!",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2020"
323,Marsh Christmas,I was looking for something affordable...this was it!,"  I wasn't sure when I bought this if it would be more junk or not, but I am happy to let you know this is great!I wanted something I could setup at my door looking out the window and this was perfect. For daytime use I get alerts through the app on my phone whether I am home or not and can see it. There was no subscription to anything other than just registering on the app and no fees or credit card required. You can download the clips to your phone and then upload to your pc if you want to save any clips. I just bought one because I wasn't sure how well it would do. Here are tips, If you are wanting night time this one specifically does do night and day, but if you want outdoor night time you'll need to put an outdoor one or have a decent light outside to light the area you want to secure. This is only because if you place it inside the window will cause a glare from the infrared light and the on light, but for what I wanted it works just fine with my porch light at an angle (my deck and part of my drive way shows in the dark and all my driveway and deck show in the daytime light.) Indoors it works perfectly for night/day time use and I am super impressed with the clarity of the video. For this price this is the best affordable home security you can get. The one I have (which may have different settings on the paid cloud setup) records up to 30 seconds on motion detection and has a sensitivity setting I have mine on highest and it does capture light shadow differences some but for the most part it captures cars coming and going in my neighborhood and people coming to my door. We had issues with packages disappearing and so this now makes me feel more secure that even if I am not at home or don't hear the door the camera will capture it being delivered and if someone steals it. I think I mentioned if u need to you can save clips directly to your phone from the app. App has several auto delete options or you can manually delete them before the auto deletion days come around(which is what I do). I cant say it enough this camera is awesome. It only needs wifi and power (if its not the wireless one) and the app on your phone to work. Its super easy to set up too.

328,beto,Great with some room for improvement.,  I added this to my existing blink xt2 system. I was unaware it works as a standalone unit without a need for a module but it integrated into my current Blink app and system seamlessly. It said there was no additional charge for cloud storage as I already have storage included with my other blink cameras. I wanted one interior camera for the basement and the price is great for this. I have had a great experience with my other Blink cameras. Some xt2 some xt and now this mini. The setup is very easy and the image quality has been excellent. The overall system of wireless and now interior wired is very flexible. I was disappointed with the mini in two ways. First it does NOT have advanced activity zones like the Blink XT2 cameras. As this is a new unit that should have been standard. The activity zones allow you to block out specific areas so to avoid false motion alarm triggers. The advanced have more and smaller areas you can select. This is a poor oversight that I hope gets corrected. XT1 lacks this as well but those are older first generation cams. My second issue is the poor mounting design and bracket. They all use this twist lock mounting but on the mini it just feels like it could break easily. The Blink app continues to improve and allows great features not found in any other system. You can now set up routines where motion on a camera can trigger other actions such as turning on smart lights automatically. There is another where if it hears the sound of an alarm going off it will notify you. There are multiple settings to adjust sensitivity and recording length on all cams.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2020"
329,Brittany,Good deal for the cost.,"  Good value for basic home security. There are two improvements I’d recommend for the cameras. 1) I wish I could program the cameras individually. I’d like to be able to shut off one room while keeping the others on. As it is if you shut off one you have to shut off all of them. 2) Is the length of time in recording. (30 seconds) Again, I’d like to extend the recording time on some of the cameras but 30 seconds is the limit. The lag time after the 30 seconds of recording misses the continued movement of whatever triggered it and when it picks up again it’s to late. My camera picked up a person coming to my door to ring the bell but I wasn’t home. When I didn’t answer they took my package after the 30 seconds but it wasn’t caught on the recording of them taking it. There was no proof of the theft and they denied it. No charges could be filed per police because I knew the neighbor. (We are no longer friends!)

In any case, after much hours of communicating with Nest and Google, with no solution, I canceled it. The set up of this camera was easy. Yet, I did not realize that it doesn't have a continuous record for the day, like Nest. I can't go back to a certain time with this camera. It records constantly of anything that moves for only 30 seconds. Like a flag on a windy day. We have many windy days. I would end up with tons of  30 second recordings of something blowing in the wind. Why 30 seconds? Please have it just record throughout the day and leave out the 30 seconds. Then have the option for us to choose to save a record of a certain time of pic. That's how Nest is set up. I'm not going back to Nest, though. The service experience at Nest was poor enough to not go back.This purchase was a waste of money, unless they update this, and if they do update, then the existing cameras needs to be updated.

Furthermore, there is no action required on your part until Extended Live View is accessible in your app.""From an end-user's point of view, ""not initially seeing this feature"" means that you will be prompted every 60 seconds to 'Continue' monitoring.This is ridiculous, a classic bait-and-switch marketing tactic designed to drive subscriptions without delivering a promised option.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 23, 2022"

Any video we open (we have 3) it’s just a loud static filled mess. If someone talks, you can barely make it out. The night vision is good, but it never picks up movement on this night mode. It picks it up fine in regular day light mode. The cameras don’t rotate. I knew this when buying them, but it’s still a con. The app is terrible. There’s no option for a multi camera mode, so you’re having to click one, exit out, wait for it to clear, then go into another. Just slow and silly. You also have to pay for recorded video. So in my opinion, nope, it’s not worth it at all. Every con I have listed above is a key pro feature to every other model I have found for the same price.

344,Chaddernaut,Easy Set Up,"  Easy Set Up. I see some complaints about it being hard to set up from some self-admittedly  technically challenged people; I think they may be refering to remembering computer and home network passwords, and creating new accounts. As far as the setting up of the camera it is very easy, but I did note one confusing thing about the camera software: I could not figure-out why ""arming the camera"" did not result in motion detection when setting up a second phone; it was because I did not have motion detection enabled in the properties. I think that this setting was default when setting up the first phone, but not default when setting up the second phone. A pleasant suprise to me is that the system works with even a poor cell phone signal, like I have, at home. The system works totally over the Net and your home network at home but when you are away from home, as long as you are in an area with a good cell phone signal, it works with cell signal.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2021"

347,Jillian,Frustrating Setup and Not as Good As Others,"  This was a 5$ add-on to another purchase.  I would not pay full price.I have several different camera platforms including the now retired Amazon Cloud Cam.  All other camera brands like this I own are a breeze to setup (especially wyze).  First, I was very disappointed that I had to create yet another new account for the Amazon product.  Next, it struggled mightily with my wifi connectivity.I uncovered two issues with the wifi setup:First, if your wifi network is WPA2 and still allows auto negotiation to TKIP, the network will not show up in your list.  Your phone may warn you that this is ""weak"" security, but the camera does not-- it simply hides it.  Forcing your wifi (in my case an AP) into WPA2/AES solved the problem partially, until my second problem.Second problem was that the wifi SSID contained a dash.  Once correcting the first problem above, the WiFi network showed in the list, but with a blank name.  Manually entering the SSID caused connect failure.  Not wanting to break the other devices I had running, I ended up having to host a secondary SSID that omitted the dash.  With that it connected fine.Finally, I found the mounting for the camera horrible and cheap.  It has a simply round mounting base with a snap-over cover for the screws.  The cover cannot be removed without a small pry tool and once disconnected, it cannot be fully separated from the camera.  Instead, it hangs lose around the pivot point.  The end result is that to mount the camera with the provided screws on the wall requires you to hold the screw, the camera AND this silly ring out of the way.  A magnetic base or exposed screws through the base would've been better or easier.  If they were worried about somebody easily stealing it and therefore hid the screws, this seems a waste: the base is cheap plastic and could be snapped off the wall by a toddler.  In fact, once secured with its screws I stretched the USB cable a bit to remove slack and caused the whole camera to lean significantly.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2021"

350,Sean T.,Useless without a subscription plan,"  These Blink products were always a scam to get you to subscribe to their cloud services. Without a cloud subscription these are completly useless.  Unless you can get the real-time alert, pull out your phone, unlock your phone, navigate to the app and attempt to view the live-view footage all within the 20 second time frame. I don't think there is a person on the planet that can randomly do that.  Best case scenario you're already in the Blink app on your phone when the alert comes through and you 'MAY' get a quick glimpse of the live-view footage.These are disposible cameras, they will not work after aprox 1 year of use.  You've been warned.If you are looking for a tempoary camera that will be trash after 1 year and don't mind paying a monthly/yearly subscription for Amazon's Blink cloud services, this 'might' be the camera for you.Good luck to you though, I personally regret every single thing I've purchased that is of the Blink brand.

351,Micheal Sisco,An above average camera on the cheap,"  What the Blink Mini does best is provide a cheap security camera from a reputable company (not another fly-by-night operation, but rather from the devil-you-know). From the audio quality (input and output) to the picture and video, everything is fairly standard; kinda cheap, but a good value.For the first year, you also get free online storage, but there isn’t a local storage option [yet]. If you did want to store video at home, there will be an accessory you can buy to back it up, but you can’t throw an SD card in there and call it a day.The delay, even over a robust network with low latency, has about 4 seconds of delay and a lot of dropped data when there is significant motion. That’s just in live view in my experience (I never check the recordings) but that should be addressed quickly on Blink’s part.I’ve seen worse from this price range, but overall I’m satisfied, provided the video stability is improved.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2020"

Connected to existing system but it only gave me 30 days free cloud when the system it was connected to has free cloud so was told any camera added to the system would also have free cloud. It doesn’t. I have an sd card so I can still record motion, I just cant record live views. There is no continuous viewing which is annoying at times. Sometimes shadows can set of the motion sensor. The app is pretty good. There are many different settings and you can zoom in and out. Cameras load up quick for viewing. Quick alerts. It’s easy to scroll through saved videos.

356,Jul,I have 3. Put some research into it &don’t let a sale fool you-like it did me 😟,"  There is so many things you have to play around with to get it to work everyday and every light change. It also won’t show out a window if you don’t shut night mode off when it’s dark (even if it’s well lit outside) but then if it’s daylight and you don’t flip the night mode back on auto it won’t pick up anything at all, inside or out but even if you do that sometimes it switches back off and you miss 12 hours of monitoring if you weren’t paying really close attention that no alerts were coming in. I also have a really hard time getting it to connect to live mode. The first week it worked fine, now it just stops. No reason. Didn’t touch a thing. Just nothing and no matter what you do nothing fixes it until minutes or hours later it’ll just do it. As far as the sensitivity, sometimes a snowflake or a gnat flying by will set it off. Other times, for 8 hours someone moved Next to me and nothing (also while I was on vacation someone came into my house, took 3 delivered Christmas present bags I had put in my bedroom the day before I left for vacation and they used the restroom, left a key lay in the middle of the floor and who knows what else and I didn’t get one single alert!!! I didn’t know about it until I got home and started to wrap the Christmas presents and realized 3 of my grandkids gifts were gone so I started piecing things together (the key, the toilet etc). It feels so violating & that was the main reason I got it! To feel safe!! I also wanted to be able to watch my car and front door from my bedroom, especially if someone were to knock or something so I could see if it was for my door before going and so that I could hear them all the way in my room but this thing will only stay on about 30 seconds without you having to click the continue button that comes up. It stays on longer on Echo Show (not much) but it records it the entire time & you don’t have a whole lot of room to begin with to save videos without having to subscribe to something-that I haven’t figured out yet but what’s the point of it won’t do what it’s supposed to anyway! Not to mention, you can change how long it will save your videos without starting to automatically deleting them. You maximum time you can choose to save them is 60 days! WT..???? Half the time I probably wouldn’t even know I needed to look at something for longer than that! Like if I forgot where I put something on my birthday last year? Maybe I could look at the videos & see if it caught where I put it (like a pair of earrings I only wear on special occasions). Or if someone took something (that is if it actually worked like it should) but it was something like a firestick or game consol you only use when you have guests or the grandkids are over so it might have been 6 months since you used it last. I don’t know what all to say. I mean, overall I like the concept but it just isn’t for me. I’m going to have to send them back and try a different brand all together. Try your luck if you want. I would think I just got a bad one but I got 3 of them and even though I opened them up at the same time, I bought them at different times so they didn’t even come from the same batch!

While the video is decent quality, getting them at the right time is impossible as far as I can tell. I have 2 minis inside the house looking out through a window, so there is no point in leaving them armed overnight as the IR would just reflect from the window. But once I disarm them, rearming them is extremely flaky. Sometimes it took hours or days before the camera would start taking videos again. I reached out to Customer Service and discovered that ""24/7"" promise is fiction. I sat on hold for a little while and then got a ""no one is available, please leave your phone number for a return call"" message. I left my phone # but have NOT received a call and that was 3 days ago.

I wish I could say I was happy with that decision, but, unfortunately I am not.The setup is easy and it's easy to add a camera to an existing Blink system. The app is extremely okay and VERY limited. You can't have different schedules for different cameras. They all have to be armed or disarmed by schedule. Communication betwixt the app and the cameras is extraordinarily slow, even with fiber internet.The biggest problem I have with the minis is the motion detection. The cameras have no problem detecting a piece of dust falling from the ceiling, or maybe a moth flying around. But a person walking around in my shed or garage for over an hour?

I'm extremely disappointed in both of Amazons devices.The camera itself has two way voice, night vision and motion alerts and is compatible with Alexa. Those are positives. However, when viewing the camera on my phone or alexa device, it times out after 60 seconds and returns to the home screen. I want to use this for long term active monitoring, not ""checking it occasionally"". This is frustrating. So if you're planning on using this as a baby monitor or security device, find something else.Sometimes when giving alexa a command to check the camera, it simply wont connect. This is not a problem with my wifi or anything, it's just bad software on amazons part. When checking the camera on my phone, it takes forever to connect and when it times out after 60 seconds and the video stops, hitting the play button crashes the app.Being frustrated with the Alexa Show and the Blink camera, I tried to find software to view the camera from my PC. It doesn't exist. People will reply that I can use an android emulator program and load the phone app on my computer inside of that, but you end up running into all of the same problems as the phone app.The alexa show itself has minimal features and very few customization options and settings. I expected so much more. The hardware itself is great, the speaker sounds good, the screen is bright, clear and sensitive to touch, but amazons software and it's unintuitive design is off putting.It's 2021 and these devices are capable of so much more, it's a shame to see them fail so miserably at such simple tasks.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2021"

You basically have to be close and in center of the camera to have the motion detector trigger a warning.2) Another thing I observed was that after a camera for unplugged accidentally, it took 30 minutes before notification. That seems highly undesirable from a security monitoring perspective.3) I have had a few false positive triggers. No observable movement and something about start of dusk triggers it in one room.4) As many other people pointed out, the 30 second limit on live view is quite annoying if I want to use it to monitor my baby.Still trying to decide whether I want to keep them or return and buy something higher quality for a few extra bucks.

365,Y. Giordano,Love the Blink Mini!!!,  So far 3 have purchased 3 blink minis and they work great for keeping an eye on the house / pets while I’m away. The live view from the app and cloud recording is nice. Blink sells the sync module 2 that lets you store recordings locally if you want that option. The cloud storage is free for 30 days from when you activate your new camera and then it’s subscription based. With 4K becoming mainstream i would hope future blink minis come with higher resolution. The night vision works great and so does motion detection. The app allows you to adjust sensitivity for motion and intensity of the infrared for night vision. One other thing to note is these require 2.4Ghz Wi_Fi so in the future it would be nice when blink starts to support 5ghz networks  The last thing to note is this is as easy as plugging in a usb cable and the setting it up with an app. You can move them around etc and all you need is power.

The issues I have with it are about the Live viewing and the motion detection.****I would like to note that I don't know if my issues stem from the cameras themselves or from Blink's software****My issue with the Live feed is that you can only view it for 30 seconds at a time. Sure, I could continuously click ""Continue"", but that means I have to constantly watching for the popup and I feel that I shouldn't have to do this with an outlet powered camera. It doesn't say this anywhere on the product page and the only time you will see this information is when you're already looking for a solution.My issue with the motion detection is that either the sensitivity of it isn't sensitive enough or that it only works well until a certain distance away. This is a problem because it's supposed to be recording my reptiles but I'm only getting a handful of recordings a day for the entire day. I first thought the motion detection just wasn't sensitive enough because I only get about a handful of recordings a day and they're usually when the animals are pretty close to the camera. While my reptiles may be a bit slower moving than a human, they're definitely not so slow that the camera wouldn't capture them moving around their enclosures. Now I'm wondering if the motion detection only works well a short distance away from the camera. I've noticed that not only are of all the recordings I get *up close*, they're also all of the same area per enclosure and never past a certain point.

I know two people that have these cameras and they don’t have problems, but my cameras motion detection did not work. Sometimes it would catch motion other times it would not. For instance, I would take my dog out and walk in front of the camera for 15 minutes and it would pick up none of it. Can you believe that? 15 minutes walking in front of the camera and no motion detection. Big problem. But I wouldn’t be writing this review if tech-support would’ve addressed the issue. After countless emails and multiple tech-support reps, they all said the same thing and were not helpful. They kept telling me I just needed to delete the cameras and re-add them, that I needed to update the app, I need to reboot my phone, and then finally they’re like “oh it’s your Wi-Fi that’s the problem.” I knew this wasn’t the case so I put my brothers 2 cameras, which are the exact same type of cameras, blink minis, and I put them in the exact same spot on the exact same Wi-Fi and they work perfectly fine. I tried to tell tech-support that I knew it was not a Wi-Fi issue because I know other peoples cameras work fine and even told them that I put my brothers cameras in the exact same spot on the exact same Wi-Fi. I even told them that my brothers cameras are working on the same Wi-Fi in the same spot and were working without a problem. But the tech support wasn’t helpful just told me the same thing over and over again, obviously unaware of the fact that doing the same thing over and over is akin to insanity. Finally, exasperated and angry that tech-support would not help me, I realized I was still in the return window and so I am returning the cameras. Thanks for nothing tech-support.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2021"
368,Jessica Lynn,Be advised - not for baby monitor,"  Overall, it's a great camera, but not for use in a child's room.We have an older toddler and wanted to move away from a baby monitor, and thought this would be a great substitute.  We wanted something just to check in on him periodically, but not a constant live feed.  We also wanted something with motion detection (because he's still learning to use the potty during the night.)It works great for the motion detection, because he is already awake, but noticed that whenever we would check in on him, his eyes would open and he would look at the camera.  After further investigation, when you use the live look in feature, the camera itself makes a horribly loud clicking noise, then clicks again when you end.  Our son is a light sleeper, so it would wake him every single time.I would give this 5 stars if it were used for anything else besides a toddler monitor, but I can't because it is a very bad option for this.  We had to use the cameras in different parts of the house, and buy a whole new camera system for his room.So please be advised if you plan on using this as a baby monitor.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2020"
369,J Moo,Not what I need it for.,  If you want to have continuous live view this isn't for you. Picture is ok but grainy especially at night. You get about 5 minutes of viewing with the echo show 8 then it cuts out. That may be the echo show that cuts it out but using the app you get a notification to keep viewing every 30 seconds or it cuts out. So do not buy this to continuously view or for security or for a baby/child/pet monitor because it won't work. We will probably return this and buy another camera that will work with Alexa.Update: this camera continously shuts off and loses connection. Now it just stays offline. Total waste of money. No slot for memory card either. It's basically just a shelf ornament now.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2021"
370,JoAnne,Poor product,"  Extremely disappointing. The infrared night vision works only if a person is no more than one to two feet away from the camera.  In contacting Blink, they say this is an ongoing issue and that they are “working on a fix” for it. In checking the Blink blogs, I see that this issue for this particular camera has been ongoing since April 2020 —I am writing this review in late September 2020.Daytime detection is OK. But, only up to about 20 feet maximum— You need to set up multiple cameras to see your entire room. – – Another disappointment. If you are considering this camera, be aware that you are not going to get any useful night vision, which to me, is the most important feature. Blink says they have no idea when a fix is expected.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2020"

I have it in my front window to record the front of my house. Sometimes it would record people walking up to the house but other times, people would get all the way to my front door without recording. I missed the return window or I would have sent this back.

372,Thomas B,So far -- not impressed with quality of the product or customer support,"  I had a brand new one that I've had for one month and noticed that the status lights were blinking on it today.  The blink app showed that it was offline.  I could not get it reconnect at all.  Removed and tried to re-add, no luck.  Reset button on the bottom, no luck, it just stopped talking to Wi Fi for some reason.  I've got 4 other XTs that I have had for 4 or more years and they are working just fine.What should have been a quick call to support to get a new one turned into a waste of time dealing with support personnel that can only read from a script.  I ran through the nonsense on the phone up to a point where I finally told them ""Look, this is a month old and I am not wasting any more time with your script -- send me a new one.""  They finally agreed to do this, but then told me that the new might do it to since it ""could be my network""  Odd, I have four other cams that are working just fine and about 25 other devices that are working just fine.  This camera was working just fine up to the point that it died.Supposedly a new one is the mail -- we'll see.I have heard that blink support was a JOKE but I never had to deal with them until today.  I can confirm that it is indeed a joke.  I hope that I never have to deal with them again.  We wasted more time and MONEY  troubleshooting a 20 dollar camera than the product is worth.  Amazon bought this company -- they should fire all customer support immediately and take that support on in-house.

373,A R,Great Product--a few quirks,"  To be clear, for the price difference between this camera and its competition, I am very happy with the product, there are just a few quirks.When it switches to night vision almost every night I get a ""motion detected"" notification. Now I am used to it and when I get the notification at a certain time I'm pretty sure thats what it is, but it was very unnerving at first.Also, every morning I need to ""disarm"" and re-""arm"" the camera. If I do not the motion detection is not as effective.Overall, I was looking for something for my new apartment, because I have heard horror stories, and I just want to know if the landlord is entering my apartment when he is not supposed to be. Blink definitely serves that purpose.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2020"
374,West Coast,Simply did not work | UPDATE,"  SECOND UPDATE: I ordered a two-pack to ensure I had monitoring in more areas of my house. Setup was so much easier this time. Since I already had the app and another camera already set up, once I plugged these in a notification came up on my phone that another camera was detected. Adding it was a breeze.UPDATE: After multiple attempts, I finally sent the camera back. Blink customer service reached out after seeing my original review. They sent a replacement camera immediately. Setup for the camera worked seamlessly this time around. The first camera was a dud but the second one turned on and connected 1-2-3.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I thought it would be a good idea to have an indoor camera but this isn’t the one, unfortunately. Plugged it in, followed the directions but never saw a blinking light. Troubleshooted but still nothing. Sending it back.

375,Yay Me!,It's okay,"  Hard to get working from the inside looking out. Infrared light needs to be turned off to work due to glass reflection. This defeats being able to see at night, making it somewhat useless. Very clear during the day. Motion sensor can be set for different sensitivity settings, which works relatively well. It seems to pick up motion that's very close, and very far away, but not in between. Odd. My beef is with the app. I needed to see my camera quickly because of a noise I heard and the app had randomly signed me out. I had to enter my user credentials, and then enter a 2 step verification code before I could view my cameras. Not cool. I think I prefer the Amazon cloud cams to these. I have 3 that still work well and I never get logged out of the app. I'm going to keep working on making these work better for my needs, but if the app keeps logging me out, I will probably return them.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2022"
376,Dee,"Decent camera, but not great for nursery/kid's rooms","  I purchased a two-pack of these cameras to put in our nursery and our other daughter's bedroom to replace the Amazon Cloud Cams (which we loved but the app started crapping out and Amazon no longer provided support).The picture quality is clear on these cameras but they are not continuously recording like the Cloud Cams were. I recognized this would be a difference when I bought the camera but what I didn't anticipate was how loud the ""click"" would be when the cameras started recording. It's pretty loud -- loud enough to wake up and/or draw the attention of small kids. When you're trying to just peek in on your kid while they're sleeping, it's a bit counterproductive to have that ""click"" wake them up.The other issue we had was the briefness of the clips. We used to enjoy pulling the Cloud Cam up on a TV and keep an eye on the kids while we watched something else but these cameras only stay live for about 1 minute before they click off and you have to ask Alexa to show XXXX's room again.The picture quality was great and they were a breeze to install so, if your application is different, these would probably be great cameras. They just didn't work for us.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2021"

Did and done and it’s working fine.However, at some point in time the folks at Blink got their wires crossed and sent me a second camera.  Kept it as a reward for all the time & effort I expended.  New cameras BOTH working fine.not certain it can be repaired....  it appears the company expects customers to figure out and share tips on on community boards on their website.  Very disturbing.

The quality of the item cable charger and even the plug in the back is good. The app is barbones but work good. There is no scrubbing or heat map on the main interface, which is a shame. I set it on my back yard last night to see if any animals are getting into my ducks, but this morning there is nothing stored. Maybe I did t arm it? But why would a camera need arming?? I currently have a nexht that is priced at about $25 and I think it's a superior product. It has an sdcard and option for cloud storage and an ip camera option to integrate to an existing dvr system. I don't care for cloud storage, I have a lot of sdcard and can manage my network just fine. Not having a recording option without a $35 accessory is a big no nooooo. We know the camera has  full server built in, so storing data on an sdcard is nothing for a camera. I won't be returning, but I won't be buying anything else.

The other did not. I’ve been going back and forth with customer service for about a month and a half with no fix in sight. They insist my camera is on an “unknown” network even though I can see that both cameras are on my network. My dad said he had the same issue and he had to put his app on his wife’s phone to fix it. I don’t have this option. So I would suggest not wasting your money on this brand. Also, this is the Amazon/Alexa/Ring brand. It is only partially compatible with Google/Nest.

380,cgust,Updated review,"  Update:I’m so over these cameras.We have good internet so that’s not the issue. But the app is always crashing or it’s a failed live view connection. ALL THE TIME. It’s freaking annoying. And I feel like it’s just gotten worse the longer we’ve had them and it hasn’t been that long.They are alright if you don’t expect a solid connection all the time but if you want something more reliable, I wouldn’t use these.Original Review:Okay, let me start by saying - it’s a pretty decent camera. I do like it. It gets a basic job done.My only dislike really is that you cannot continually watch the video feed without having to hit “continue” every 60 seconds. As someone who has a kid, this is a frustrating feature. I knew that buying it and it doesn’t sound bad at first. But the longer you have it and you find how you want to use it, this is actually pretty annoying.I just wish that they would update the software to be able to watch for longer sets of time. Other than that, it’s a good starter set of security cameras.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2020"

I was really distraught and they stayed on me until all my issues were resolved.The mini camera. I can't say enough about this camera. I like it better than the indoor/outdoor blink camera. Setup was a breeze, you would have to be dead to not be able to get it connected. It is super clear, and has a wide scope. I'm not a 100% sure, but I think this camera starts recording as soon as there is sound which enables, for me, a better viewing. Usually it would start recording once motion has been detected. If the motion is fast enough, you get a blur. This mini camera comes one once noise has been detected. For instance, when one of my family members is coming home and puts their key in the door to unlock it, the camera would start recording. When I am viewing it, I am thinking why did this clip get saved until I see the door open and they walk through it. Very impressed with it!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2020"

I ordered  3 of them. One in living room, dining room and one for my leather shop. Set up was easy, linking them was really easy. What I love about them, being able to talk through them, hear what’s going on. Oh and the night vision, I dig it 100%.  Works awesome in 0 light.well enough to turn footage over to 5-0 if the time ever comes. One thing, and I mean one thing, that I wish it were able to do is be able to see all 3 cameras on one screen. Doesn’t bother me enough to break up with Blink, just wish it did, switching between cameras takes a few seconds.

383,Brian,Use Blink customer service for these.,"  I purchased these for indoor use. After setting up the first of the 2 camera system I was pleasantly surprised. The picture quality was remarkably clear. The 2nd camera, however, had a really bad focus problem so I contacted Amazon customer service for an exchange. I was told (via online chat) that an exchange was not available so I would have to opt for a discount or refund of my purchase costs. I chose the refund. I decided I would just go ahead and look at the Amazon site and found that the item IS, in fact, available. I reluctantly ordered the system again (hoping for a better experience) as I really liked the 1st camera that I had set up. I just don't like that I was lied to about the exchange availability.Update - Blink customer service has taken care of the issue to my satisfaction.

384,Ryan G.,Some what dissapointed,"  I have an outdoor cam with floodlight and 2 indoor cams and 1 sync module. The cams are good, they do have great picture and the motion detection works great. There is a couple of short comings though. The first short coming is that the cams do not prerecord like others brands do. The second is, you cannot schedule each cam separately. I would like the outdoor cam to arm earlier than the indoor cams. With the current configuration I have to setup all cams on the same schedule which means I have to schedule for late night which renders my floodlights useless until the schedule arms or set the schedule earlier which captures all activities inside and I end up with 20, 30 or more junk videos. I don't want a bunch of sync modules plugged in and showing up in my routers wifi clients just to schedule different cams for different times. The schedule routine is already there in the app, it seems that it would be and easy programming task to enable the schedule for each cam. All of my other wifi devices do it. I need about 3 more outdoor cams with floodlights but I am reluctant to purchase any more because of this issue. This is disappointing and it seems to me that it is just a ploy to sell more product (sync modules).

I need one more to cover all the rooms in my house since I take care of my 90 year old mother and like to check in on her while at work or not at home.The cameras are extremely easy to set up and I was able to let my brothers and sister sign in to see the cameras as well.  I've owned multiple other cameras and while they were okay to set up, these were just a breeze.  They were set up and running in under 5 minutes.  The only annoying thing about set up was I had to enter the password for my wi-fi for each camera.  You'd think once the password for wifi was in, you'd be done entering it.  That's not a huge deal but just slightly annoying!Love the cameras but the one draw back is the software!  The software is made for battery operated cameras but these are plug in.  They should have had a different software package for these cameras.  The software is, well, the only way I can put it is lousy which is sad because they are great cameras.  You can only view one camera at a time and that shuts down after a very brief live view.  You should be able to just watch a live view without it constantly shutting down.  I understand why this would be for battery operated cameras but definitely not for plug in cameras!

If I needed it for longer or if i was dependant on this camera as a security camera I would probably get something else that you don't have to pay an ongoing fee for..I have to say I'm very impressed by this little camera after the initial unboxing and set up. It has a sleek design, very easy to download the blink app and easy to follow instructions with the set up. I got this camera for the motion detection aspect of it and automatic alert to help with potty training my dogs. They love to sneak away and go potty on the puppy pads instead of asking to go outside. I have it set up in their potty spot so I can instantly take them out when motion is detected. So far so good. When motion is detected it instantly sends an alert to my phone. The picture is very clear, even at night with only a lamp turned on.

App was really easy to download and start the camera, it took me less then 5 minutes from start to finish, including wall mount this camera, everything comes along inside the box. According to me it only has one drawback, it does not show your recording constantly, I dont know why they created system like this, it should show you constant live stream, but after I guess every 30 seconds, it asks you to continues, this is very monotonous,  I really hope they can fix this issue.

The motion detection triggers easily with light variance so I sometimes get multiple alerts around sunset depending on light and location of the device. Otherwise, I find it very useful. The audio detection is extremely sensitive and impressive. I can hear conversations at the other end of the house when it is triggered. Picture quality is adequate but I would not say you are going to read a license plate but you can make out faces ok if it's close enough to the camera. I find it similar to a WYZE camera with a little more sensitivity. The WYZE has internal storage capability and about the same picture quality. The BLINK build and quality seems more robust.

397,Rat Barse,Most aggravating system I have ever used,"  While the mechanicas of the cameras seem to be pretty goodSome of the worst things:Doorbell w Sync module 2- No recorded images even with a thumb drive installed in the Sync module unless you subscribe to their service and even then does not record to the drive, only the cloud. Live images only and even then it only records for about 15 seconds before requiring you to tap on ""continue?"" (which doesn't work half the time). If the delivery guy cuts across the lawn, stops at the steps and tosses the package onto the porch it doesn't record him (her). People walking down the walk from the driveway are recorded.Every day there is a 20 to 25 second recording that covers from the previous afternoon at about 5:30 PM til sometime the next morning.Blink camera - While the picture is quite good and the night vision acceptable, even with a large thumb drive installed in the sync module the clips are useless. I recently installes the camera in my shop and over the course of about 2 hours one afternoon:58 clips, none over 4 seconds. Bear in mind I was working in the shop and constantly moving around within site of he camera.The vast majority of the clips were betweem 0 (yeah Zero) and 2 seconds.Do yourself a favor and find something worth buying, especially if you're looking for a security system that will provide usable video and monitoring capabilities.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2022"

It had good features and decent reviews.  Don't really care about the picture as much as reliability.  App is simple and easy enough, but for the first few times it kept dropping the internet even though it was literally right beside the router!  I was just about to return it because of this, but decided to check online about issues.  Apparently several folks have had the same problem.  Long story short, most routers have a reset button.  I pushed mine then reconnected the camera.  Solved the problem!  It's been a week now with no issues.  I love the ability to talk to my bird and cat through the camera.

The saying, ""The squeaky wheel gets the oil"" applied here since it took a bad review to get this resolved.

The first motion detected was when the care giver got my mother unto the commode.While the camera was super easy to install, the night time picture quality is poor, motion is often undetected, you can only view for 30 seconds and during the live view option, the view is not continuous and will automatically shut off after 30 seconds if you don't tap the ""continue?""",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2021"

So I jumped at the opportunity to see what the heck she is doing up there before I set some major boundaries. I'm a curious one. Anyway: the camera is great! It is easy to set-up and use, the night vision provides a decent image/recording, the motion detection works like it should. I have no complaints, other than the eccentric aunt hasn't been over lately so I haven't gotten to use it for my intended purpose, lol. I plan to train it on the cat's food and water if I have to leave for a few days, so I can keep an eye on her. I can't wait to see what other purposes develop!

Then, of course I could sign up for the subscription plan for $100 a year.  I'm looking for other cameras to consider while 'reading' in more depth next time.  I'm sad about this.

Problem is, when your free trial runs out, they slow down the video retrieval (says:  ""USB takes longer to load"" as it's loading - really?).  This is obviously done on purpose to punish you for not buying a subscription.  On top of that there's another passive/aggressive punishment doled out - you can no longer do a ""Select all"" and delete.  They really hang you out to dry on this one.

There’s a ‘disarm’ button, and ‘do not save’ button, ‘enable’ button, ‘motion recording button’ button, and then a ‘save’ button. And guess what? I turned every single one off and it is STILL saving the live videos onto the cloud.Additional gripe: the Blink app asks you every 60 seconds if you want to continue watching live, if you don’t click ‘continue’ in like 1 second then it stops your live feed.

Originally they said we know we have an issue with the motion sense and with the new update they are going to be better give us a chance and as a courtesy they sent out a replacement set and a free camera. I have made all the updates and the blink cameras still don’t work. I’m really upset that I didn’t just return them like I wanted to originally because now I’m stuck with these useless cameras and terrible customer service that never returns the calls they promised. I changed the 2 star to a 1 star.So I started with blink when they became an amazon product and I loved them from the start! I have 3 of the XT2s and they are wonderful. I chose those instead of the regular XT because I was using them in my girls rooms and needed to the way radio option. I was ecstatic to see the release of the blink mini with all the same features with the wired camera so I didn’t have to keep buying batteries since I use them a lot with my two little ones. I ordered them and set up my XT2s outside which was my thought when I purchased them, I’d just put them outside when I didn’t need them in the girls rooms anymore.Unfortunately these fell completely short. The motion sense doesn’t catch anything it misses my toddler climbing out of her bed down the ladder then onto her potty then back up the ladder to her bed but then all of a sudden I get motion detection when no one is in there. Very disappointed with these two cameras. I initially thought I received a defective set because I was so used the amazing XT2s but I called amazon and got replacements sent out and they are exactly the same. I think these are unfortunately going to be returned and I’m going to have to bring back my XT2s again.

410,"Ok,Boomer",Not good,"  Didn’t realize before buying that the viewing time was capped at a few seconds. After reading more reviews now I see I’m not the only one to make that mistake. I’m not sure why live view needs to be capped, especially on this camera that is hard wired and not battery powered like their other units. Also, and a bigger issue for me, is that whenever you do view the camera the camera itself makes a loud mechanical “click” noise every time the camera activates and deactivates. For our young toddler age child this is no good as it’s very noticeable and she’s actually scared of this now.Edit: dropped a star for terrible wifi range. The camera was 1 floor away from my wifi router. It kept dropping offline and Blink support told me it was due to low wifi signal. I put the camera in the same room as my router and it's been working for a few days now. This is crazy that it has to be in the same room as the wifi router, as I have Blink outdoor cameras that go through several walls and across my yard with no problem. Blink support solution was that I need a wifi extender to put this camera upstairs, even though my wifi signal isn't the issue, as evidenced by how far away I can put my outdoor cameras. They said the wifi chip is the same in the mini vs the outdoor.Edit: Moved the camera to the basement, directly below the wifi router. It worked fine for a month or so, and now today is back ""offline"" requiring a reset again. Don't bother with this camera, it's a waste.

You can only see one camera screen at a time and switching between cameras with only the sync module takes a full 20 seconds.

That was not a really good idea. Down in the fine print, they have a limit of 10 cameras on one ""system"". Just what a ""system"" is ... very unclear. What *is* clear is that the app will slap your hand if you try to add camera number 11. What makes it a bit odd is the stuff up in the bold print that says you can have an ""unlimited"" number of cameras on the (paid) app. Next step will be to see if a second Blink hub helps things ....=============So after a bit of fooling around. What you do is ""add to a new system"" (that catchy name) on the app once you go over 10 cameras. Give it a new name (like ... second :) ) and you can add another 10 cameras.

If you open the app, you won’t get any live views, you have to open each camera individually and hope it’s working at the time (whole separate issue).

We also tried the Ring indoor cam but it wasn't as flexible with angling. This Blink mini offers a cheaper price-point and flexible positioning. My only knock on it is that it only records for 30 seconds max whereas the Arlo & Ring offered up to 2 minutes max recording. As such, it generally doesn't catch the cat's full bathroom visit but at least we have a general idea of who used what box and can figure it out from there. It also doesn't offer sound-activation but that is okay for our purposes of litter box monitoring. Overall very pleased with the camera and have now purchased multiple Blink minis for less than the cost of 1 of the other brands.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2021"

Impossible to use as a baby monitor, which was part of our intent. It also doesn't record all of  the motion! Many of the videos I watched had nothing in them because it was too slow to catch anything. Also, we bought these in October and used them for a few months, took a break and then have been using them again for the past month. There is now a subscription required to record any video.

430,Ken K.,Great camera for security,"  I received this as a free inclusion with the purchase of an Echo Show 5.  I live where we have 5 foot gates around our townhouse patios, and this Blink Mini lets me see my gate, patio, and from the side someone at the front door. The reason I can do this is that it, ""Pixelates"" through the glass of my sliding glass doors, per an article I read. So, I have it set up inside, but it looks outside. It's not made to be out in the elements.It is motion sensitive (adjustable), has a mic (not much use for hearing the patio, but a nice feature for other use at another time),  and it alerts me on my phone through the Blink app on my phone and I can view my patio live! I can look at what the camera sees on my Echo Show 5 also. It has infrared for night viewing, but my patio lights are bright enough that I have the infrared turned off and it gives a nice clear, color picture - just like daytime!I love this despite one quirk. If you turn the mic off (as I said it's useless through the sliding glass door), then the Echo Show errors and says, ""Hmmmm, Camera is not responding"" or ""Ok. I'm not quite sure what went wrong"" or ""OK""This error message occurs if your devices are muted when you use a voice command ""Alexa show me the [name of cam]"". It is only an issue when the Echo Show has the latest firmware version 6.5.4.1 installed. The solution is to enable the microphone for that camera in the Blink app's Live View settings.So, I eanble the mic, set the volume to zero and voilà, works perfectly.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2020"

434,Nicholas Dimoulis,Blink Mini vs Wyze V3,"  The picture series has Wyze first and Blink Mini 2nd in all shots. First pic is of both at my wall mount. First comparison is Image Quality as cameras capture in daytime. I am standing at 20 ft from cameras. Next enlargements are done by zooming thise images on IPhone 12 Pro Max and doing screen grab of each. Wyze wins with sharper images. Lastly is night vision comparison. Night vision is hugely better on Wyze. Why have a security camera if someone breaks in and their faces are blurry? Pros and cons: First Amazon owned Blink feels more solid product support wise, long term as its a bigger name with likely more resources. I had cheap Chinese MIPC based cameras before - what a joke! 2nd I don't want images in cloud. I want local discreet storage. The Blink system can give that with Bluetooth available USB sync module storage possibility. The Sync Module can be hidden in a outlet in a cabinet or a location not nearby. That is better than Wyze. Micro SD cards in camera (Wyze) mean suspect can steal them or destroy them easily - so this is a strike against Wyze. Lastly I don't like the pigtail on the Wyze V3. I know they did this for sealing/weather tightness. But they could still do a co injection molded sealed insertion of the connector at the camera body. Cameras should all have flat round common diameter bottoms, designed properly and have common interfaces for hookups and wire concealment in wire tracks. In this way they fit avariety of mounts. For wire concealment I use Legrand Cordmate C10 white wire channel it works very well. Standardize all interfaces please. So really neither has their act together 100%.

   I really like these cameras a lot. I used to have an Arlo set and these surpass those for sure (and for a fraction of the price). These were very easy to set up and never fail or randomly shut off like others I have had.Pros:NO HUB!!!! Great picture quality, EXCELLENT sound quality in recorded videos, ability to 2-way speak through camera, excellent free plan for online storage, ability to save any video to your phone without converting, great options in app for personalizing almost every aspect of recording.Cons:It must first record the video before alerting you, inability to receive alerts for a single camera (must receive all or none), the speakers on camera are a tad too quiet and both sides must pause before speaking again, night vision lacks details in moving objects, no SD card slots, if facing out a window the glare is horrible, to use the live view you must press a button in your app every 30 seconds to continue.All in all, I really like them to be honest. These work perfect for what I need as a consumer. I'm not a shop owner worried about theft and I live in a good community so I just use them to keep an eye on my kids and things of that nature at home... and catching the occasional fairy or ghost at 3am apparently.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2020"

I imagine it can be used as a baby monitor as well. I ask Alexa to turn on my cam and feed pops up pretty quick on my show and spot. I initially bought it to put in my window to watch my vehicle but the outside lights cause glare on the window because the camera housing is white so all I get for video is a reflection of the camera.

It does this well.It also requires a premium subscription to really operate as advertised, so do not be swayed by the low cost. I can only speak to the Mac and Android apps, but overall they are very poor quality. Connections drop constantly, app has to be open to record, and there is no way to monitor constantly. The automatic setup does work well however. Overall, probably about as good as the apps that come with the various knockoffs available here.

It does not. I have the camera only 1 foot away from the router and can not get it to connect.First Edit 6/21/20: i was able to get it working with one of my phones wifi tethering (android s7) While my iphone would receive the same connection failure. The device updated and then i tried to reconnect using my home wifi, again it would not work. Should also state that not only is my router in spec for this device, my internet speeds are 100MB U/D so this is faulty. Even my cheep chinese lightbulbs work with my routers yet this cant even make a connection.Followup 6/23/20: Blink has since contacted me and is attempting to troubleshoot, in the meantime i was able to get it working on another network in my s/o house which was a pretty easy setup. While the camera works and is decent for the price in terms of clarity from what i experienced its not real time and displays with a full 6 second or more lag while viewing from the same network on both my phone and the echo show the fps isnt the greatest either. Kinda makes the intercom through the camera pointless. Still a few leagues behind setting up picams in both clarity and frame rate, also with the ability to set custom storage on your own network still missing from this device its miles behind the picam, hopefully when this feature gets added it has decent settings that are for more advanced users.Im upping my review from 1 to 3 stars because of the support attempts so far and because the clarity is decent for the price. If i can get it working on my network it will be worth the 4 stars.Update 3, 6/24/20 - Blink support had me download an app to monitor my network sending them data that i don't even get to see myself only for support to tell me that i should call verizon and see if they can fix the problem by telling them that i have a blink camera that wont connect, what a joke, do they really think verizon has the time to deal with redoing my network for a single device that wont connect when everything else is fine.

Movement is slightly delayed and more glitchy than previous cameras but not enough for more than a second or two so fine for me watching my cats and moderate security if I hear a bump in the night.Cancelled the auto subscription cloud plan ASAP - that would be a wallet smack and was annoying but meh knew it was coming based on the reviews.Audio is also sort of delayed but my cats don’t talk to me so it’s all good.Overall fit my needs for the price point. Cut a large command strip in half to use as an adhesive to my wall and bought two 20ft each micro usb cables to fix the short default cord issue. The base stand does pop off and you can put it into the back of the cam over the QR code and it does great and allows rotation. This was a big selling point in keeping them. If you leave the base on the bottom you can’t walk mount it without some special frame for it. So unnecessary. Command strip was stellar.Might end up buying a couple more with time.

Even when I do get a recording, the option of how long it will continue to monitor the motion is too short. I wish it had an option to stay on longer if my dog is still moving, but it cuts it off at a certain amount of time no matter what. I did a lot of research and waited a long time before finally buying a camera, and I’m Very disappointed in this product.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2021"
460,HeatherW,Good little cameras; Not best in class.,"  So I've been using Arlo for a while and it's pretty good but I like the Amazon ecosystem and wanted to see if these new mini cameras would be a good replacement. I bought some to try. Verdict is that these are easier to use and have great picture but with 3 fixable flaws:1) most cameras offer the option to turn off the IR lights; I was told these cameras can't. If you need to put these facing a window that could be a problem.2) my biggest hope was that it would be easy to have these cameras send an announcement to Alexa - they cannot. This is a big shame given how this use is important for the elderly, security and as a baby monitor. You can try to use a skill called Notify Me but those are notifications not announcements which means you won't know about any motion unless you check the notifications. Announcements would be better.3) with Arlo you can see multiple cameras on a single screen. Again with the minis and the Blink app you can't.Bottom line is that I would say with some modifications these would be best in class cameras. For now I would say are not quite there yet.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2020"

Turning off the Blink mini microphone (in the BLINK app) solved the problem. I can now access the camera on all three of my Echo Show 5 units.

Installed relatively easily, so I ordered and installed two minis.  After about a week, cameras started going offline for no apparent reason, usually requiring on-site intervention to bring them back.  After an hour on the phone with support, I was told there was a bad update and I had to revert to the original version, which I did.  Cameras worked for two days, and went back offline.  System is in my vacation home 700 miles away, so I can't just drop in to reset them every couple of days.  Currently 4 of the 6 cameras at my house are off line and they have been for days since I can't visit the location to reset them.

The image will be upside down on your phone, tv, echo etc. I have many other brands of cameras and they all have this feature. this issue has been complained about on the blink forum for years! No changes have been made! Also, I wanted the motion detection feature to be able to trigger a routine (smart light come on) within the Alexa app (blink is an amazon company). This seems fairly reasonable to me. Nope! Not capable. You can do it through third party apps, but not Alexa. Also, you can’t watch multiple cameras live on the screen at one time! Come on Amazon!

This was one of the reasons why this was a good value, until now.  Now it is just an lesser-value security camera; you get more function with other security cameras. Without the 'cloud' storage option, the camera just shows a picture only when you chose to view it, only.  There is no support for other security monitoring software packages.  There is another device that you can purchase, but it only stores videos locally to a flash disk.  You then have to take that disk to another device to view the videos (I have not purchased and used this device).

470,TCH,Feel cheated,"  Changed my mind and edited my review...after a year I now am told I have to have a subscription to view motion detection from mini cameras they only pick up motion sporadically at best anyway...when originally purchased nothing was mentioned about any subscription plan needed to view clips... I never keep clips after viewing anyway... why pay for cloud storage I am not using.  View and delete...that’s all I use it for. It was nice if you didn’t hear the notification sound and couldn’t go live right away to view live .  Not that nice when the minis don’t always pick up motion though.

Yet I still processed a return on it , it's nowhere near up to expectations if you really need to rely on capturing important footage. If there's continuous motion, it doesn't continually record, in my experiences. It'll record in segments , stop, and  if motion is still happening it may or may not start recording again for another 15 or so seconds. I had it in place of my nest cam facing out my window by sidewalk to watch for anyone trying to mess with vehicles at night, and I got so aggravated that as someone would walk by it would start recording but catch nothing.

Think of this system as ONLY something to notify you of motion. Because it will NOT catch the beginning of motion. i.e You will not see the person walking up to you door untill he or she is pretty darn close, and after that, you will probably not see them walking away either.The software is really garbage. If you have neighborhood cats, this system will drive you absolutely crazy!!! No matter what settings you try, you cannot stop them from triggering your system.

Here comes disappointment number 2.  While viewing the camera on the echo show that was purchased along with the camera, we quickly found out that you could not access the camera on a phone through the Blink app simultaneously while the camera was being viewed through the echo show.Needless to say, we’ll be returning both items, and continue our search for another baby monitor.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2021"

I like that it has night vision and motion notifications, I can see all of the motion-sensed videos it took during the night when ever she got up. It helped us determine our pup does not like her nice fluffy bed, but prefers the hardwood floor. We removed the bed from her crate and now she sleeps more soundly.

497,Amazon Customer,Echo show and Blink do not work well together,"  The Blink camera's I bought were purchased with an Echo show.  Setup of the camera's on Android, using the Blink app was easy.  Overall image quality is good.Getting Blink to work with the bundled Echo show has been futile.  The directions indicate the setup must be done in the Alexa app, so that was a challenge since the echo show doesn't have that app.  And I don't have any history using the Alexa app, so it took me some time to figure out I had to install that app separately on a different device.But the real issue I have is that the camera's are named in Blink. And the advertisement and the Echo show app all say you can use the cameras with simple names.  But this has not been possible for me.  The Alexa App detects the camera's and names them only by the serial number.  Naming the camera's is not currently explained in the ""Alexa Setup and Troubleshooting Guide"".Additionally, one camera only detects motion sporadically.  I have these in a shop environment and I frequently only get detected by the second camera.  I pass the first twice and it usually doesn't notice me.

They’re obviously not the highest quality/most expensive cameras on the market but it’s disappointing to have put over $300 into 6 cameras and a memory plan and find that they only record about half the time. I bought them for my grandmother’s house as she has daily caregivers and significant memory issues and I wanted to be able to keep an eye and make sure they are there when they’re supposed to be and doing what they’re supposed to do but these don’t trigger more than half the time making them unreliable for their intended use.

You can miss a lot of activity during this time.But for a cheap camera , I didn't expect a lot. The biggest pain in the behind is now I can't even view the videos anymore.

It’s a waste of money after your 30 day period. It’s like once they made sure you can’t return it, the system starts to fail! Plus night vision is terrible. If someone breaks in let’s say in the 6 morning, if I’m lucky the system will notify like at midnight or it might not even work because it the wifi connection sucks and I won’t know till I get back home.

Once Trial is up for the storage, you will have to pay a monthly subscription.  Or it seems you would need to pay more for the larger blink Cameras which seem to provide a local storage hub.  The Blink Mini does not provide a way to store recordings locally.  It does not provide a constant live view, it will only provide a few seconds, up to 30s I believe from the settings, and you have to keep monitoring it.  If it disconnects from the Wi-Fi connection, which could happen, it will not re-establish a connection unless you unplug the device and plug it back in.  Not good if you're away and trying to use this from the app and your home has a power surge, or a possible brown out.  For me, it's not worth the hassle.  It being plugged in constantly is nice though and can put it by any window or power outlet for use.

It records when there is nothing to see moving.  It somehow loses color and views or records in black and white about 20% of the time.  The sound bounces on and off.  There is too long of delay before it begins to record...I can come inside the house and turn the corner into my kitchen and it will not pick up the movement unless I am in view of the camera for about 5 seconds or so.  Someone could actually dash into the house and around the corner without being recorded.

521,Laura,The security issue on this device needs to be addressed and fixed.,"  I recently ran a data recovery application called disk drill on the micro blink usb drive I have attached to the sync module after discovering that someone was doing a “live view” on my indoor cameras when it clearly wasn’t me.  What I discovered is that there were a bunch of deleted videos on this device that I bought brand new and the 64 gigabytes on it were not anywhere near being used up on it.  I ran the scam after only having it for a few days. The only explanation is that someone is hacking into my blink account.  When you google if this camera can be hacked it states that there are no recent documented cases of this happening. What does that mean exactly?  What steps need to be made in order for any suspected hacking to be “documented?”  When I look at my wife network blink is listed as being “unsecured.”  It seems to me that since this is a security camera that more measures should be made to make it more secure. A sophisticated thief can hack into these cameras.  I really like these cameras, the videos it takes are clear, the night vision on them is awesome, the audio is ok it needs a little improvement but overall setting them up is fairly simple and the cameras are great quality cameras except for the security part of it.

This camera does what is supposed to and can live stream whatever you place in front of it..thats about it (unless you buy a monthly subscription, it can do more apparently but I won't be exploring that) But let me tell you some not so great things I've noticed over the past 6 months. The live stream feature is severely lacking and has a loud audible popping noise while watching even when you are on a different end of the house (which can only be heard by the observor). Next, I'm the type of person who likes to have my phone set up so I can watch my child fall asleep while I'm in my office, it gives me peace of mind. After having live stream activated it will ask you almost every minute if you want to continue watching, otherwise it will time out the screen. The next thing that was not so great to find out was when I mistakenly took my phone into my sons room with me. I had the app open, and walked into the room where the camera was and it let out a horrible screeching noise... lovely.

The unit fails to switch from night view to day view, and will not record movement. Recommended workaround is to disarm/then rearm camera daily until a firmware fix is available. (No projected delivery date for the fix)  I would consider a major problem until that is resolved.  2- The triggers to Alexa are unreliable, even with the Blink skills, reinstalled on Alexa. Update : Cas of Blink Customer Support wrote that ""....you might be able to do it with Alexa Routine Triggers...."". (I'm not feeling the confidence there.). Many times, we recieve a message from Alexa, ""sorry, I dont know what went wrong""3 - Subscription required to retain video clips. ie, if you want to see past motion (ex:someone at front door), you must pay Amazon a monthly fee, and clips are stored in the Cloud for your review. Amazon claims you can store clips locally but you need additional technology. (You guessed it - you must pay Amazon for that technology.)And even then, it appears that clips are still stored in the Cloud!)4 - Poor conversation capability - way to tinty and low volume to be of any value.Pros: Good picture, easy to install (except communications with Alexa!),  intuitive appBottom line: its just not a device you can count on.

Yes it notifies me when there’s motion, which is fine when she’s sleeping on the floor, but she’s blind and has dementia, she insists on sleeping on my bed a lot, so just getting a motion notification could mean i have a split second to get upstairs before she walks off the bed and breaks her old lady bones by the time it notices her moving and notifies me. She might be blind and have dementia but she knows who i am and wants to be with me every second so she often knows when i’m not in the room with her or laying next to me even when she’s asleep which is why i need the cam too so I can know when she wakes up, to avoid her pacing around the room looking for me.Other than that flaw (which is kinda major in my case) the picture/video quality is quite clear there’s a very very small delay which is understandable and I can check up on her when i’m not home which is nice too.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2021"

536,JD,Does Not Live Up To Expectations,"  This item has replaced the Amazon Cloud Cam. I have found several things that I did not like about this item. One is the app. The app looks like it was created by a 3-year-old.  It is hard to use and has a very bad UI. This cam cannot be viewed on a computer. With the Cloud Cam, you can view all of your cams on the website for Cloud Cam. I like to have my cams up on my computer while I am working on the computer. This cam you can only use on the phone. Overall the picture quality was very good. The features leave a lot to be desired. This is an update to my previous review. I have 2 of these cams now b/c my cloud cam died for good this time. I still do not like the app where when you open it is just 2 blank screens and you have to choose what cam to watch. You should be able to open the app and see both cams at one time then choose if you want to see one full screen then you can. Next is when you do have one of the cams pulled up you have to keep hitting continue every few seconds to keep watching the camera. Remove that  continue. I like to set my phone up while I am working and watch my cams. I do not want to have to hit a button every few seconds to keep it from turing off. 3 there is no way to watch the cameras on your web browser. Cloud cam allowed you to sign in and keep the cams up and running in a browser window.  The night vision is bad when you have it sitting in a window looking out.

There is no option to turn this off / have the camera show you a continuous live stream unless you use a Echo Show.If you use a Echo Show, it DO NOT HAVE 2 WAY AUDIO. You can only hear the camera, you can not talk through it. So if you want to talk to a person you are watching on the Echo Show, you have to stop the Echo Show stream, start the APP on your phone or tablet, enable ""live view"" and then talk to the person.  I only have to do this once or twice a day, so it's not bad for my use case, but if you need to talk to people a lot it's not a great setup.for $30 it's not bad, not great.

544,Babyblue,THE BEST SECURITY FOR THE PRICE,"  As a father of 2 I'm going to give you my complete unbiased opinion on this camera and let you decide.PROS: So easy to set up. Only time I looked at the directions was to see the app I needed to download. I love the 1080p and the Night Vision is great of set up correctly. Live video feed to my phone is wonderful and even has a 2 way microphone.The camera armed continuously sends you out alerts ⚠️ as long as motion is going on. ( PLEASE NOTE THAT WHEN YOU FIRST ARM THE CAMERA YOU WILL NOTICE THAT THE FOOTAGE TAKES PLACE AFTER THE MOTION HAS BEEN DETECTED, THIS WILL LEAD YOU TO THINK "" OH WELL ITS TO LATE IF SOMEONE BREAKS INTO MY HOUSE"" YOU CAN GO INTO THE SETTINGS AND CHAGE IT TO ALERT YOU AS SOON AS THE MOTION HAS BEEN DETECTED ) very inexpensive and magnificent for it's price. HOWEVER!!!CONS: YOU MUST PLAY AROUND WITH THE SETTINGS. what do I mean by that? The camera comes default 720p and the Night Vision is low quality. You need to go into settings and change that. The same with the motion detection you need to go in and adjust that. Things that can't be adjusted are what aggravate me the most such as, the speaker used in the 2 way is not lowed whatsoever. It was Night time and my son had his tablet on low and he couldn't hear me talking even though the volume was set to max. The livestream keeps asking me if I'd wish to continue watching what feels like every 5 seconds and if you look away just for a sec and/or don't click continue in time the live feed cuts off. Sometimes it's hard to get the live feed back up and you have to force close the app. The Night Vision after adjusting it in settings is wonderful as long as there are no reflective or even somewhat reflective surfaces near it. I had min place on the top of the cabinet and the white surface of the cabinet distorted the feed and wasn't real able to see passed it. Once I moved it to have it rest on a darker none reflective spot it worked like a dream.OVER ALLI really do love this little camera. I feel like a good majority of the stuff I dislike about it could be fixed with and update. The only thing that I would suggest changing in the next model is a significantly louder speaker so my kids could hear me. The live feed being cut short could be updated to continue to play as long as the app is open. Yes I get they're probably trying to save us data or battery life on out phones but that doesn't matter to us when we're checking on whatever we care enough to protect which is the whole purpose of buying a security camera. I really do love this little camera and I do highly recommend buying it. It does have its flaws but over all its the best I've ever seen at this price point.That you for taking the time to read my review.

546,Jamey C.,Buy Wyze Cam instead,"  There were many flaws with this... I 100% promise the Wyze Cam is better in every way AND it's cheaper. I got rid of my Blink Mini after trying a Wyze Cam.The Blink support couldn't help me with an IR issue, you can't turn off the IR in night mode (it's useless if looking through a window at night if you're relying on any IR light, including with an external IR light source), and the app honestly is terrible. Every 30 seconds of live viewing requires you to say you're still viewing. After December, you will have to pay for any useful cloud storage. The Wyze has free 14-day rolling footage (the only downside is it only records the motion for around 12 seconds without a paid plan). Also, I got motion alerts constantly for things like bugs. The Wyze uses AI to detect if the motion is a human and if so you can set the Wyze app to notify you only for HUMAN motion (I tested it during day and night and it works well). Also, a Wyze allows for local storage to an SD card and the Blink only allows local storage if you buy an additional Blink product that enables local storage.TL/DR: Don't consider a Blink Mini, buy Wyze Cam instead.

The first thing I learned about it was that you cannot use it for continuous monitoring, something that all of my Wyze cameras can do. When I contacted their tech support about it, they told me there was no way to use it for that. Evidently, the 5-minute time limit is supposed to ""conserve bandwidth."" On a WifI network?

Poor dependability and CS,"  I'll start off by saying that I own a Blink mini and Blink XT2, which are used to monitor and ensure the well-being of my grandparents in a different house. The XT2 has worked well for me, but the Mini has just been problematic. After using the XT2, I bought a Blink Mini to add an additional camera since I was already using the blink ecosystem. Unfortunately, the Blink Mini recorded videos with static and bars going across it as if it was a 30 year old camera. I contacted blink customer service about it and after sending them a video file that clearly shows the issue, the customer service wanted me to do a wifi strength test to ensure the camera and module (sold separately for cloud storage) have good connection. It's worth mentioning that the blink mini and module are about 10 feet away from the wifi router whereas the Blink XT2 is 30+ feet away from the router and has zero issues. Anyway, I went to the other home where the Blink cameras are set up and completed the wifi strength test comprised of downloading this app and testing the wifi connection relative to the location of your camera and then sharing the report to Blink. But after completing the test and contacting Blink again, I didn't receive a message or call back.

They WILL NOT WORK as a local-only system even though the clips are recording to a local storage. When you lose your connection to Amazon's cloud, these cameras go dead. And you have fewer options in the app using local storage, which is clearly a push by Amazon to try and get you to pay for the cloud service.I have also found that they don't always re-connect and start saving clips after a power or wifi outage without you having to fiddle with unplugging and replugging stuff. So if you go on vacation and the connection gets dropped, your cameras will be useless for days until you get back home and physically get it working again.Coming from an Amazon fan and stockholder, I have wasted far too much of my life trying to get this junk to work as reliable home surveillance.

556,Shop S-Mart,Not for continuous viewing or use in a quiet space,"  Bought these for replace/add to a couple Nest cameras to monitor our toddler and for assistance in puppy training.Although setup was easy and video quality great, we determined fairly quickly that there are deficiencies which makes them not suitable at this time for our needs per the cons below:Cons: - No continuous view in app or via Alexa device like Echo Show.  30 sec max and a little longer on Echo Show unless you keep clicking on continue to keep the video going- App will only show video from one camera at a time.  If you want to monitor multiple areas at a time this is not possible- Only one person can view a camera at a time- Loud click when turning on.  This wakes up our toddler who’s a light sleeper (you can hear the click over a fan across the room on low speed).  Used for crate training a puppy for sleeping at night and wakes up the dog as well when we check on her.  From Amazon Support: to clarify that the Mini camera uses the IR at night when the room is dark to detect any motions, and the click for the IR on and off is the component functionality sound, and that can not be taking off unless you turn the IR off and give some light to the room.- Motion sensing is a little delayed.  Will alert you but not tell you which camera was triggered until you look up alert in the app.- Have to manually set or create a schedule for the cameras to monitor and alert you for security.  There is no option to turn on based on location automatically when you leave and return. - From Amazon: if you integrate the Blink system with IFTTT, you can enable the applet for arming/disarming the Blink system through the IFTTT location feature.- Subscription service required without the “x” system.Pros:- Easy setup- Great video quality- Interfaces easily with Echo Show- PriceUnfortunately due to the no -continuous video and loud click when they turn on and off these will be confined to use in our garage and shed where intermittent viewing and motion activated monitoring will suffice.

I would have done $80 for 4 and $10/m. $160 for 4 is a horrible deal and now they don't get purchase or reoccuring monthly.

562,Sallie Speir,This is only narrowly useful and can be frustrating.,"  1. This does not stream. It takes short clips. Maybe that is enough for some users.2. Whenever a user wants access to the app to see the clips, a time-consuming process butts in. You have to sign in every time you use the app, but the process is complicated by a stupid security idea. Every time you sign in, you have to go to your phone, open a message, read a security code, and then type in the code. THEN the app will open. By that time, someone could be dead.If your phone stops working, you are out of luck because they cannot send the code by any other way.3. Tech support is junk--it doesn't matter whose fault it is. If you need help with the camera, app, etc., you will have to waste hours and energy so some foreign alternative to intelligent life can repeat a script and never fix anything, but make false promises and insult you.4. You will have to subscribe and pay if you want to save your clips or, I think, even see them. There is no way to save them otherwise.The few good points are irrelevant if you can't even get access to the app.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2021"

However, if you read the fine print on that site, it says your card will be charged $39.95 a month if you don't cancel with the limited trial time period.  Thankfully my card company notified me that I was being charged.  You could NOT download the app without the credit card info.  I packed it up and was going to send it back but thought: ""There should be an app I can download.""  Went to the App store, downloaded the app, set up my account with no request for a credit card.

In addition, when I went to their website to notify them of this disconnect in their info, the support page came up with:  ""page not found"".  What a mess.

570,Sarah Pearl,Decent at best.  Don't expect too much out of this setup.,"  A wifi camera for $35 - cool!  Oh, I need a separate $35  Module to store data locally?  I guess that isn't too bad for $70.  Oh, I also need to add on storage? $15.  $85 total.Despite it only functioning via A/C power (no batteries) there is no way to get a continuous video feed on it, even when you opt to manually go into live view more.  Blink claims this isn't an option because of the battery powered units and power cell consumption.  But again, this is an A/C powered unit.  It only allows you to watch a max of about 2 minutes, in 30 second intervals that prompt you to ""continue?"".  And yes, this is even with a Sync Module and 64GB of local storage.But in any case, I purchased this for the motion sensor and notifications.  That motion sensor function has been spotty at best.  It picks up cars driving by quite well, but often misses people that are clearly in view and, per the way Blink claims the camera's sensor works, changing pixels by moving.  I have the camera positioned up high, so there's no chance of the subject walking directly towards the camera (Blink repeatedly claims that it isn't recommended to position the camera where your subject is moving directly towards it).  I'm probably at the limits of it's distance (20 feet) but still, it should function properly even at their maximum recommended distance.  I keep reading reports of inconsistency from unit to unit and I can't help but feel that mine may be faulty.That said, the setup in total with the Sync Module and storage was ~$95 after tax.  I honestly expected a little better performance from the primary function, motion detection, for that total package price.  If I were to do it over again I would spend more on an all-in-one unit, or even a full system with more reliable motion sensor tech.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2021"

Very affordable, and not incredible quality, but definitely without a doubt good enough if you got a clip of someone you don't know in your house the police should easily be able to figure out who it is based on the video quality. Could use a longer cord for mounting It higher on a wall further from the outlet, but that isn't on Blink for that. I would recommend this product.

I finally  went to check it out after a while, and once i entered the room I was confused on why an alert didn’t go off for that. I checked the sensitivity to make sure it was on high, and it was, so I do not understand why nothing happened. I reset it, unplugged it, plugged it back in and the motion detection would not go off, i decided to step 2 ft away from the camera and the sensor went off.

The second is on during the day, facing out a window toward a bird feeder stuck on the outside of the window. I wasn't sure if the camera facing outside would pick up motion at all, and expected the video quality to be pretty bad through the glass, but it catches birds eating from the feeder without any problem and the video quality is pretty good considering it's recording through a window.My only complaint is there is a longer delay in connecting to the camera located on the opposite side of the house from the router. I ordered a new outdoor camera and once that arrives I'll connect the Minis to the Sync Module 2 and I'm hopeful that will help with the delay.

Thus a four star rating rather than a five.Purchased a two pack camera set.  First camera worked fine but a few days later installed second camera and it would throw the first camera offline.  App won't let you reset camera because it is already registered and you can't delete the camera without calling support.  After I called support everything came up but within about 30 minutes, first camera went offline again.  Extremely frustrating, they have work yet to do to fix issue.  It would be nice if they would at least let you delete or access camera settings page of an offline camera yourself so you can reinstall.  No camera at all now until I can get support to delete the offline camera.  Guess I will just settle for one camera until I can afford to purchase a different brand.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2020"
596,Customer,It's OK to Blink,"  This mini-Blink came in a package with the new, more svelte Echo 5. Set up was very easy following the included instructions. I was up and running in under 10 minutes. Integration with Alexa was easy after the camera was detected by my network. Note the mini only works on the 2.4 GHz band - if you only have 5.0, look elsewhere.Picture quality is very good with distortion typical to a wide angle lens. Night vision is adequate. Currently only cloud storage is supported (free introductory period paid by Amazon), however, a sync module is due to ship which will provide local SD card storage.In short, this was a great value and I'm highly satisfied. I'll update in the event of issues.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2020"

Durning the day when she is playing I can look at what she is getting into. Just what I needed.Cons: connection can be sketchy at times. Don’t know if this is because of my network or if it is because of Amazon. The motion detection does require a subscription, so if your looking for a security camera without paying monthly, this is not for you. Also, only one person can be viewing at a time. Some people complain that it doesn’t allow for continuous viewing…. No, it does time out, but I’ve never really noticed a problem reconnecting if need be.Overall, it does exactly what I need.

Yeah, no. The lag is so terrible on this thing while testing it out we had to wait MINUTES for it to finally show what we were doing. It's bad. So don't expect an actual live view.

599,IzzyTheSlöth,"Quality Great, Everything Else..Not So Great","  I bought this thinking it was going to be exactly what I needed. I have a pet rabbit who learned to yeet herself out of her pen, so I needed a camera to drop in every now and then to check on her. I purchased these during Black Friday so I got a pack of 3 for a good price.I set up the first one since I only received one initially until they sent the other two later, and everything was dandy. The picture was good, the night vision was good. The one thing that I quickly learned (when I propped up my phone at work) that wasn’t my favorite, was the fact that I can’t just keep the video on. It asks me three times if I wanted to continue before it glitch then kicked me out of the app entirely. I tired several times and noticed after the third “continue?” That it will just glitch and shut down the app.I read another review by Haley where she also said, “ The main issue for me is that there is no option for continuous viewing. The live view from the app will automatically shut off after 30 seconds if you don't tap the ""continue?"" prompt.”My husband had bought a different brand similar to the one I got for his work, but he has the ability to just bring up the video and set his phone down with no issue.The other really frustrating part is that you get a 30 free day trial before you have to pay for a subscription to be able to access certain features. 1. Why can’t I just be able to save video without having to pay for it? 2. When I have tried the save feature during the trial, it’s very confusing. I switched it over to save, but as soon as I exit out of live view then go back into live view, it had switched back to discard on its own. I also tried switching it to save then exiting and seeing the result after a minute, and as soon as I saw the saved footage, before I could even click it to watch it, it disappeared and I have no idea why. I go back into live view and it switched itself to discard again. So what’s the point? Why would I pay for something that doesn’t even work? I haven’t even opened the other two because what’s the point?10/10 would return and just get the one my husband has. He can also save footage without needing a subscription.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2022"

There is not a single recording showing myself opening the garage and walking towards the office door where the camera is installed, it records some random clips showing nothing in my garage, a ghost maybe... well... i don't know because there's nothing in the garage.

I caught it on prime day sale and used it indoors until my Wife made me put it in the garage because it was picking up every conversation we we having.  Actually it was meant for my garage to begin with.  The unit works well and was somewhat easy to install.  I had to do some breakdown of the unit to get the cord to run through the mount and the mount had to be placed in a way to get a proper application for video.  Hard to explain but it took some maneuvering of the mount to get it right.  The item works well when it stays connected but at times loses connection.  So I have loss of motion that I know occurred.

606,willies,Just Okay,"  Honestly, a bit let down by the overall experience with these cameras, of which I have four now.  They are suitable only for occasionally keeping an eye on a room or place and do not work super well for motion detection/security functions, and do not have great resolution for anything at a distance (across the room, say).  The Blink app which is required for your Alexa devices to show you the feed (for example on an Echo Show - ""show the living room"") does not always link up with the camera, even when opening the app directly on your phone or tablet links to the feed just fine.  The two-way communication is half-duplex (only one side can transmit while the other side receives) and the connection is wonky with audio sometimes completely dropping out entirely while using it.  I want to stress that these cameras are NOT useless - but they are not what you might be expecting.  I have repurposed them from my original intended use to tasks more suitable for them... for example, one of them now watches over a 3D printer so that I can check on it remotely.  If you want home security, or reliable two-way communications, definitely look at something else.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2020"

If you plan to use it without paying for their cloud service look else where. Their app is complete rubbish if using an USB to store clips. Using their cloud service you can delete multiple clips at once but they disable this option when using the USB. So, you have to delete clips one by one. If you don't, the storage will fill up quickly and stop recording new clips to the drive. This was obviously done to force users to pay for their cloud service.

That's how it works *if* you have a cloud account subscription, which is free for the first 30 days then costs $3/month or $30/year, depending on the plan.With an optional Sync2 module, it's possible to store clips to an USB drive locally, and perhaps skip cloud subscription at the cost of reduced functionality (one can view stored clips from a computer, or via the Blink app but without saving live views or other niceties).",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2021"

You can watch a 5 minute feed but you need to keep pressing ""Continue?"" when it comes up, and the motion detection only records a few seconds at a time. It is not efficient at all as security camera. Thankfully I only paid 5$ for it as an additional deal, also it ONLY runs off WiFi so if your wifi is spotty it will have issues with the set up.As for the camera its self, its decently built, I like how it is just a USB-C cable that connects to it in case it breaks its an easy replacement.

But, like the X2 this one also insists on updating firmware before it comes-online (but it does this completely automagically, no user intervention required ... and it updates much faster than the X2 series). The only ""flaw"" I've seen, so far, is that the power-cord is difficult to plug into the (recessed) camera's jack ... it takes quite a bit of forceful wiggling to get it to go in (altho it is conveniently ""keyed"" so there's NO WAY you're gonna try and plug it in upside down ... the plug will only fit into the recess ONE way ... a good feature, if only they had solved the misalignment problem). It automatically added itself to my Alexa-Blink skill so the camera immediately is integrated into the Alexa app and works flawlessly (as expected).

This is the first indoor cam we have had so nothing to compare it to but consider the picture quality to be good, in a dark unlit room it is good enough. The 30 second record is a little frustrating. The most interesting bits are always in the 10 second break window - go figure.  My biggest issue and reason for returning is inconsistency. For example, I have recordings of people & pets leaving a room but it didn't detect or record them entering the room. I delete my recordings but may occasionally want to save a 30 second recording but to do this I have to subscribe to $3 a month cloud space.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2022"
635,Kim ,LOUD Static and clicking,"  This is the 3rd indoor camera I've used as a baby monitor and sometimes security device. I thought by getting an Amazon-branded product I would be buying something with a bit more quality and safety than the Chinese products I've had. Nope! Of all of them, these are the worst! They make a loud clicking sound when it turns on for live viewing and when it changes from daylight to night vision- and when you factor in the changes in ambient light from a door, curtain, or person moving those clicking sounds can be several times a minute! It's very difficult to see any detail in the night vision. When viewing live there is a very loud static sound that forces you to mute it. I refrain from using it for an hour after bedtime because the loud clicking can wake up my child/ prevent my child from falling asleep- making it largely pointless.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2021"

638,Jenna A,Very disappointed with $600+ Blink system 2xx,"  The Blink system arrived promptly, but has been disappointing.  After some difficulties connecting the module, the cameras were easy to connect.  Currently 5 cameras and 2 doorbells are deployed.One big problem is that the system often delays the photos/notifications by 12 to 24 hours.  The burglars had come and gone by the time their picture arrived.Another big problem is that the camera only detects 2 of 3 cars driving through the gate.  2/3 security was not the goal.  Upping sensitivity resulted in lots of nuisance trips, but did not capture all the vehicular or pedestrian traffic.A third serious issue is that the cameras seem to go off-line in a random fashion.  Some came back online automatically.  Two are still off-line.One of the battery operated cameras drained the supplied batteries within 3 days of deployment.  The batteries were supposed to last 6 months or better.During daylight, the pictures are fine.  At night, car headlights overwhelm the cameras so badly that it is not possible to identify the vehicle type much less read the license plate.For $600+ I'm much less than happy.Rev A:  I contacted Amazon and have received some support.  System is still wonky.  Thumbnail still fails 90%+.I think my house may be too big for the Blink wireless range.  I am also working with wifi range extender, but so far the Netgear/Amazon extender has refused to connect to the AT&T and T-Mobile internet hotspots at the western and eastern ends of my property, respectively.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2022"

We also have old wiring in our house, so I needed a camera that could be plugged into a regular outlet versus messing with the electrical system. This was beyond easy to set up and we couldn't be happier. The picture and sound quality is great, as well is the night vision and motion detection. The size is small and barely noticeable depending on where you put it.

645,jj,Wait to buy the Mini. Buy the XT2 now.,"  I'd like to start out by saying that I have three XT2 cameras and I love them. Because of that, when I saw that the Blink Mini cameras were on sale, I figured I should add on to my system. This was a huge mistake. The cameras fail to switch from IR to regular filming consistently. This leads to either blown out footage or even failure for it to record at all. I switched off the IR on one of the cameras, hoping this would fix the problem, but it still fails to record about half of the time. It is a shame, because these cameras have much better mounts than the XT2s (stronger, more range of motion, and allow for bottom or back mounting) and not having to worry about battery levels would be nice. These cameras seem like they may be decent eventually, but I would wait until there is a patch to purchase them. Blink says that they are currently working on fixing them, but there is no ETA on when the patch may be out. In their current state, the cameras have been pretty much unusable.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2020"
646,Randall C Williams,"A decent budget home or small business security camera, provided you have good internet","  First and foremost: this camera does not store recordings locally. (On a data device.) It requires the internet to function for any purpose. Second, the length of recordings is limited and, therefore, of limited utility if you need a dedicated 24 hour recording or extended recording for security purposes. Finally, the storage Blink allots is limited to the point that this camera is not all that useful for tracking high traffic areas.All that aside, this indoor camera will function well enough as part of a mixed home security solution provided you have a decent internet connection. It is lightweight (in most every sense) and can be easily placed anywhere with funtak or similar light adhesives. It has decent picture quality, sound detection, and the sound output is similarly good. Nightvision is pretty good for a camera its size.  If you're looking for a camera that helps you check on your home/pet/children when you are away, this is a good choice. If you're looking for a camera for dedicated security, I recommend using a camera that has an onboard storage device (like an sd card) in conjunction.

I love the fact that you can set up motion detection alerts, the two-way audio feature, the clear videos, and the accessibility of the app. But, if you wanted to continuously watch the live feed, there is a ""Continue?"" button that pops up every 30 seconds. This got very annoying especially when I'm working and I just want the video to continuously play next to me. Also, even when there is no sound that should be coming from the camera's side, there is a constant hum, radio-like sound. I know for sure there is not a sound like that coming from inside my house and yet it still plays it through the app. Despite that, it's a great camera, I just wish it didn't have to ask me if I am still there watching.

These cameras were purchased when Amazon had their Black Friday sale in November so pretty inexpensive cameras just to get them into the hands of as many people as possible.  So far, the cameras meet my expectations and they work as advertised.  The outdoor version of these cameras are what I really need, and there seems to be no practical way to mount these minis as outdoor cameras.

681,Knukleur,It works. Finally. I think.,"  Just canceled the return request for the Blink Mini because it finally seems to be working. I was having trouble with it staying connected to WiFi & once it lost connection the only option was resetting the camera, deleting the camera info on the app & starting all over. I bought it to check the house while away (because we may travel again someday, you know...) and resetting the camera from a beach hundreds of miles away didn't seem possible.I wish I could tell you that it was the fine tech support staff from Blink that made the difference, but that would be lying. The three stars are for the camera. When it works, picture is clear, and the app lets you fine tune motion sensing settings. We'll see if I'm tempted to pay for storage or just use the app for live monitoring. Two stars empty for the worse than useless tech support. Email response was delayed by days, live phone was a crapshoot (Is that you Borat? Cool tie-in with Prime, but I need someone intelligible OK?) They had me download & run an app, RouteThis Helps, which supposedly analyzed my network and kicked out a cryptic code for me to forward. What info it gathered, I'll never know.  (Creepy? Yes.) Their analysis came in an email with a .png image attached basically saying ""It's your WiFi, please contact your WiFi supplier."" Not helpful. So, I trolled the Community postings for Blink & my router (a real good one BTW.) And started herping & derping with the settings.If you're still reading, here is the best advice I can give you if you're having trouble. If you have a dual band router, the camera can only use the 2.4Ghz band. Make sure, in your router settings,  it is separated from the 5Ghz band. It must have its own unique name, and its own unique password. Download your router's latest firmware, reset it a few times. Reset the camera, delete the Blink app & download again, setting up afresh. Make sure your phone/tablet is on the same 2.4Ghz network when you do the setup. Pray. Throw some salt over your shoulder.

682,Lyn-Z,Decent cheap camera,  I was looking for security camera and I ended up buying the blink mini for what I paid for it it does the job with a decent Wi-Fi connection you don't have to worry about it cutting in and out and the picture is pretty good even in night vision although it is only black and white but in the settings you can change the picture quality all the way up to 1080p and the night vision you can change the intensity of it so it's not blinding like other reviews have said the reason why it doesn't get five stars is because the live view option is annoying having to press continue every 30 seconds is really a bummer and I wish in a future update they changed that also would like the ability to record for more than 30 second intervals when motion is captured and not have a 10-second delay between videos the only other gripe issue that I have is that the power cord does not lock into the camera it's a snug fit but if somebody really wanted to they can just pull it out but overall if you're looking for a cheap camera and a cheap subscription service for me it's $3 a month before unlimited recording on the cloud it's not going to be the worst thing in the world but just keep in mind the cheap price doesn't give you every feature you want and if you're looking for a baby monitor or something to show a constant feed as of right now you can't do that,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 20, 2021"

It arrived with the stand not attached to the cam.Maybe I’m just doing something wrong but no matter how hard I try I cannot get the stand to attach to the cam.So since I wanted the cam set on a high surface, my fridge, pointing downward, without the stand it can’t be used for what I purchased it for.Would just send it back but because of the virus and my being older and in the high risk group, I’m afraid to send it back.Plus I don’t go out so I’d have to ask a relative to risk coming over to ship it back for me, I don’t want to put them at risk either.So I’m stuck with a useless Blink Mini unless someone knows how to attach the stand to the cam and can please let me know.I already tried pushing the cam onto the stand or trying to screw the stand by hand into the hole at the base of the cam but when I let go of the cam it just falls back off of the stand.My first Blink Mini already had the stand attached when it arrived, so I’ve not had to deal with this issue before.Thanks for reading this.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2020"

When I'm at work I want to see how much dog is doing on a constant stream and unfortunately that isn't possible unless I tap my screen every 30 seconds. Also, only one person can view the camera stream at a time.

Seems this is a hold over from the previous ""battery only"" software.  Additionally, to use the motion detection features, you have to subscribe.

Also, she had gotten sentimental items and misplaced them along with my keys to my filing cabinet. I needed cameras for our home for her safety etc. The hookup was easy and quick. The pictures are so clear even in night vision. I also love being able to speak to our toddler when she’s attempting to climb on things. I can redirect her from downstairs when I’m in my online class etc. It is a godsend! I ordered two the first day and then decided to order the echo show 5 that evening so the camera views can be visible for my husband to also view our daughter without him having to download the app etc. He’s not tech savvy, so this was an excellent option for him. The echo should be here today, so I cannot review how is works with the blink mini. So, the cameras arrived and I loved them so much, I ordered another one to complete every angle of our downstairs living area. I showed a girlfriend at the gym as we looked in on my husband and daughter. She loved the clarity and requested I send her the link! You will not be disappointed. I suggest reading all the specifications and details about the mini before ordering it. People have complained about it not working properly. My guess would be internet connection.

So whatever triggered the motion is normally gone by the time you open it up to see what's going on.Second to that, they just updated the software, where you now need to be subscribed to the paid blink plan in order to save the footage you are viewing live.Makes me wonder what else they are going to limit in the future before you need to be subscribed to the paid plan to even use the camera.I very much regret cheaping out and buying this camera.

I think in the future, hopefully soon the app with receive updates to better use these cameras. Overall the app is usable though. I think the biggest take away is that these cameras come from a reputable company.

706,Matthew N.,Not recommended as baby monitor,"  I bought these cameras to put in my toddlers  rooms as baby monitors. I don’t recommend them for that purpose for two reasons:1. The camera makes a LOUD clicking noise when motion or a change in lighting triggers it to record or switch to night vision. It’s so loud I can hear it when I’m in another room. Definitely affected my kids’ sleep.2. The motion trigger to record is not sensitive enough. I turned the sensitivity for the camera to the most sensitive setting, and it still would not be triggered all the time when my kids woke up in the night. Then I couldn’t look back and see how long they had been awake.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2021"
707,Abbey P.,Rip off,"  I bought this camera for home security to be able to record any incidents that might occur while I’m not home. A month after I bought the camera the greedy company decided that instead of allowing us to save a certain number of videos, now they won’t allow any amount of videos to be saved… unless you sign up for their monthly subscription. So basically the camera is pointless now unless I want to pay more every single month just in case I want to record one of the videos. There are lots of other cameras out there that don’t force you to pay monthly just to use it. I wish I would’ve gotten one of those instead because I’m not going to pay monthly for the rest of my life for a camera I *might* need to use. How ridiculous. I recommend buying a camera from a company that ISN’T looking for any possible way to take more money from you every single month.

This comes in handy when they are getting into things they should not get into.

If this is to secure a sensitive area; Blink offers cameras with much higher picture quality at fair pricing.

I will update again when the update is made.I already have an existing Blink system and it works great so I thought this would be a great addition. I was so wrong!  The motion detection is horrible.

After that , the next day they are inactive until I take a picture or video with them to re-activate them.

   I bought this, because of Amazon Prime Day! There was a great deal!I had been meaning to get one of these for a LONG time and I finally got one!Super helpful and reassuring knowing that I can view my home and also make sure my pup isn’t getting into too much trouble while I am out!Pros:-Delivery came quick.-Good price for two cameras.-Set up was super simple! Plug in and register through the Blink Home Monitor App! I thought it would be more difficult but it wasn’t.-The wire was a decent length so it could have a pretty good reach from the outlet. I use a power strip to give me some more leeway.-The two way audio was a cool feature.-Motion detection was not bad and worked pretty well. I have my early notifications on.-Live viewing was a plus and could zoom in.-Able to save clips. (There is a limited storage space though, but I just recommend going through them frequently to make sure they aren’t just junk. So, make sure to go through your clips!)-Lots of options for your own preference (settings such as turning off motion sensor, sensitivity, etc.)Cons:-Night vision was not very efficient if too far. (If a smaller area, clearer). My other one I have covers a larger area and doesn’t catch further images as well and happens to have a glare in the area I placed it in. Day time is way clearer.**I can’t think of anything else at the moment for cons to be honest other than that.Overall, I think it is pretty good security camera with great features.

Setup and installation was easy, camera was easily paired with the Blink App. During the day and when lit, the picture is clear, night vision is a little blurry, but was expected. The Blink app is easy to use - I like that I can turn the camera on and off from my phone, as the room is a high traffic room during the day and I don't always need it on. Also, I like that I can schedule the camera to arm/disarm via the app. I bought this camera with two BlinkXT2 camers for my home, so two seperate locations - and mangaed by one app!

I should be able to use this whenever I want or not, and I should have the choice to keep the videos if I really needed to - there is so much identity theft and miss-use going on anymore that the only need I might have to keep a video is to use the video in court.

However, there was a log of the movements that were saved but they only give you a certain amount of time until the “trial” runs out.

Even if I was to keep it as a live video security camera that is not possible since live feed only works 30 seconds at a time. One would need to keep clicking on app to continue live viewing every 30 seconds. That’s not realistic. Apparently you can bypass cloud subscription by purchasing additional sync module which will set you back another $35+ dollars. If I understand that right.

I kept the subscription for almost a year until I had enough of the false alarms. I bought some cameras from Gosund for the same price they work perfect!

The camera quality is so awful, the motion detection is iffy, the app is clunky and the subscription is overpriced. I had no clue I wouldn’t even be able to see what was recorded without paying a monthly fee. I am notified that there is motion, I can check cameras, but if something happens when I’m not actively checking the app, I will not see it. I will only be notified that something moved in front of my camera. If you’re considering this brand, I highly recommend you check out Wyze or WUUK brand instead.

Sometimes there is lag or even she gets certain places without it catching, but for the most part, I now know when she is doing something she shouldn't be. I am very impressed with it!

The picture quality is top notch and the night vision is flawless. We use this with our echo show 8 so the camera stays on for several minutes at a time, I know the biggest complaint was that using the app you can only watch it for 30 seconds before you need to refresh it. Using the echo though allows the camera to stay on for about 5 minutes, so we can monitor the room and make sure the baby is okay and safe. And having the ability to hear audio is a big plus as well, making this a great nursery cam. Lastly, the price for what you’re getting is crazy, I feel like they could be charging more for this so I appreciate the low price point.

The most important of them is that you cannot record a live view w/o cloud plan. There’s almost no way of knowing this BEFORE you purchase. It’s very deceptive and that info should be front and center in all item descriptions. There’s no logical technical reason for withholding these features.

For a fraction of the cost you can build with blink. Worth it!3-10-21 the camera is not working.

I can traverse the entire room, walking speed, and motion detection is not triggered. b)When motion detection does work a video recording is made.  This video has terrible quality.  I can't even recognized my own mother at a distance of 8 feet from the camera. c) Currently I'm getting free storage for those motion activated videos, but it seems that's only for a limited time (end of 2020).

You can't record and/or get live motion notifications without paying for the feature either, which is odd but you do get a few weeks for free.

The video quality is good enough but still has choppy image issues with fast movements.  The worst thing about the blink is the sound, it seems to cut out whenever there is too much sound. For example, multiple voices going on at once or loud noises.  The camera will cut off the sound during these times so you have to ask the other individual on the camera to repeat.  Other than that, I would only think of this system like a 30 second babysitter, certainly not a security system or basic security setup.

The motion detection works very well it doesn’t seem to get effected by moving headlights coming through the window though the window has sheer in front of it. The image quality doesn’t seem that good though it says 1080p but it’s good enough to make out what’s in the room if it be a person, animal, or little rodent. The night vision is pretty much the same quality as when not on except it’s in black and white but one down side of the night vision is when I open up the live feed it makes a click sound and turns on the light(s) for night vision (they aren’t lights just little leds to indicate it’s on) same when you leave the live feed it makes a click and turns the small leds off and as well as taking a picture it clicks twice. It probably does the same when motion is detected with night vision, I haven’t tested that yet though. Another thing is the motion detection when on night vision there are little dust particles that are visible that float past the camera but the motion detection luckily doesn’t see them so it’s not overly sensitive. Otherwise a very nice camera that’s good for security and very light weight easy to hide. Those are my only complaints and they’re just kinda small things that make it a little less than 5 star quality.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2021"
797,Mark Hackman,Live View Is Unusable,"  1. Live View only allows you to continuously watch for 30 seconds. After that you have to hit a ""continue"" button or it closes out in the app. There are no settings to increase the live view time.2. Live View frequently returns ""system is busy"" message and does not show you anything.We tried using this as a baby monitor but its a no go. I understand the company is more ""security"" system focused but through their marketing material they made it seem like the device would be useful for live monitoring.They should mention that live view is limited by time and they need to work out their software bugs.As much as I hated CACAGOO Video Baby Monitor (I was trying to replace it with the Blink system) it works much better.P.S. there is no multi-user functionality (multi-accounts for the same system with different logins and usage rights) you have to share one email/password with all users.Edit: Updated review to 3 stars. A Blink support person contacted me and pointed out that the description does have ""(live view is not continuous)"" in the description.

I only use it to monitor a power bank charging display so I don't have to babysit near the outlet.  This usage makes it worthwhile for me because I have back problems and I have to go outside to smoke.

799,Chris G.,Goes offline and horrible motion detection,  I bought this camera to see what my cat was doing while I was not home. Very easy to set up and good night vision quality. The app itself is simple but could be better. I am not impressed at all with the motion detection aspect. I could sometimes walk right in front of it and it won’t even catch the motion. Also the camera goes offline and becomes unavailable all the time has happened every day since I got it. So it becomes essentially useless because the only way to get it back online is to unplug it and plug it back in. This defeats the purpose of having this camera the first place because when you need it it disconnects and you have to physically reconnect it which you cannot do when you were not home. No I do not have a problem with my Wi-Fi it’s the only thing connected to it during the day and I live in a very small apartment.

I have a router which transmits both 2.4 and 5.0. The router decided which one would be best for each usage. Please note that the Blink camera requires 2.4.

My network is in tip top shape but the camera's only pickup some activity & not others. You can walk by now & it records & an hour later, walk by the same area under same lighting conditions & it never records. I ran network diagnostics in my house & moved my sync module to ensure all cameras & sync module getting good signal as Blink would recommend to do when having problems. Really dissatisfied w/ the reliability of recording for security purposes. I have a camera pointed at my driveway, it recorded me pulling out of driveway & then when I pull back in 10 minutes later, never recorded it (it missed an entire vehicle) last night the front camera just stopped recording after 11:43PM & then this morning around 9am I did live view & it started recording cars driving by again. Before 9am i saw cars drive by that it just did not record them. It is like the camera fell asleep until I did a live view.We recently had a car broken into in our driveway & the camera did not record the crime.Even though the hardware is inconsistent, I must say that customer service was fast & responsive. Customer service was able to retrieve deleted files quickly (within a day) unfortunately the camera did not record any activity of a person in our driveway that got into the car, but camera did happen to record a suspicious car that stopped in front of my house at 3am the night the incident happened.Another bug I noticed is that if you turn off the night vision in settings & you later go into settings to make a change to the recording zone, the night vision will be turned back on to auto even though I did not make that change.So over all the concept of Blink is right, & I like the fact that I don't have to pay monthly fees but unfortunately the software in the camera's or the sync module is Buggy & glitchy & not reliable enough for a REAL security camera & just good as a TOY if you want to MAYBE see what is happening around your house.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2020"

812,John R,Good for the price and does what I was looking for,"  This little camera is really easy to mount and setup.  Download the blink app and you are ready to go.  I chose not to mount the cameras to the wall using the provided screws.  Instead, I used 3M mounting strips which work really well.I had a defective unit and the customer service was fantastic about shipping out a new one (very quickly).  The new unit works very well and I get the coverage that I wanted.The early notification feature works well - so you get a notification right away (and I like the ability to customize the delay between notifications).I have been moving the cameras around in various places (from large rooms, small rooms, hallways, etc..) with various lighting.  Overall, the camera works as described (up to 20 feet of motion detection in both well-lit locations and with no light - IR mode).I would give it 5 stars, but there are two scenarios I have found which seems to reduce the distance of the motion detection.  *  When I place the camera in a hallway (about 4-5 feet across), for whatever reason the motion-sensing drops from 20 feet (when it is in a large room) down to about 10 feet.  The lighting conditions do not matter nor changing the ""active"" zones of the camera.  I get the best results when the entire hallway is lit and there is significant light behind me.  *  I also have noticed a drop in motion sensitivity distance when the lighting is about the intensity 20-30 minutes before sunrise.  The IR mode is off (because there is enough light) but the camera struggles to see motion.  For my tests, the camera picks up the motion in these conditions around 12 feet (for large rooms) down to 6 feet (for hallways).The feel of the camera is very lightweight - so it seems very delicate.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2020"
813,Jonathan Murray,Not as good as Cloud Cam,"  Had Cloud Cam and was happy with them for ""person"" and ""dog bark"" sensing.  Thought I was evolving to the Blink cameras because Amazon is fazing out the Cloud Cam option.  Cloud Cam technology for sensing options and viewing options is MUCH better and wish I could simply stay with Cloud Cam.  But Amazon is moving to Blink and forcing you too come with them.  (YUCK)Cloud Cam has different sensing for ""person"", ""dog barking"", ""glass breaking"", etc.  Blink has ""motion"", that's it and it's not very good.  It either senses nothing or senses a gentle breeze every couple seconds.  Blink fail.Cloud Cam let's you view the live video feed with the app or in a web browser.  So you could pull up your cameras and view in real-time on the go with your phone or pull it up on a computer screen and leave open in a tab to keep an eye on pets, kids, deliveries, etc.  Blink is ONLY viewable through the app, no web viewing option.  In addition when you pull up the app you don't get live footage, you get a picture and then have to click on each camera to get it live...and that takes a couple more seconds for it to pull up.  There's a ton of lag and when you switch to another camera it often says ""wait, I'm still closing the last camera"".Blink is clearly a less straining system on bandwidth that Amazon has moved to for a money saving decision.  It takes less resources to run because it's not sending or providing as much data back and forth between camera and cloud servers and cloud servers and user viewing.  It's a less feature rich experience but yet still something Amazon can market and make money on.Overall, boo on Amazon/Blink for moving backwards and offering less for the same price and marketing slop.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2020"

816,Sheryl C,"Started out impressed, then frustrated, now disgusted","  4 Stars - I have 2 Blink Mini’s linked to a Module2.  I have them mounted inside and pointed toward the outside through windows.  The cameras were fairly easy and painless to set up.  I like the small size of the cameras and that they don’t have batteries to maintain or that can swell and fail over time.The picture quality is excellent daytime and low light.  I can’t comment on infrared night time picture quality, as I have disabled the infrared and LEDs to prevent reflection on the window glass.The app needs improvement.It’s good that you are able to block out zones where you don’t want to detect motion, like normal traffic on the street.  However, this doesn’t work at night as it will trigger cars in the zones blocked from monitoring.  Not just some, but all cars at night will trigger recording in the blocked zones.It’s good that you can enable and disable individual cameras easily from the home screen of the app.  However, I wish they would make it so you could silence the notification from individual cameras without disabling the motion detection and recording easily from the home screen.  The only way is to go deep into the app settings to turn off the notifications for all cameras.I tried the Beta test of the instant notification which would be good, however, it negates the ability to delete clips directly from the notification, which I like when the clip is of the mail carrier or the neighbor’s cat that likes to hang out at my house for some damn reason.  When I turned off the instant notification, I noticed that the cameras stopped picking up any motion, so I deleted and re-linked the cameras to the app and this fixed the problem.  I have not turned that function back on since.Update - Now it's 3 stars because I am starting to become frustrated with these cameras.  First of all, with the aforementioned blocking not working at night.  Secondly, it has stopped picking up the mail carrier delivering mail but picks me up walking the very same path to get the mail every time.?  A lot of users complain about having to keep pressing the continue button for live viewing.  In my case, I only use live view when aiming the camera or watching for the pizza delivery and it can become annoying even with my limited use of this function.  Many times there is a noise on the street so I attempt to see what it is, but then the camera doesn’t want to connect to live view and by the time I get it to connect, whatever was there is long gone.  Whenever I have trouble connecting to live view, I can usually get it to connect after I kill the app and restart it so thinking a lot of my issues with the cameras are app related.I am still within the free cloud storage period so don’t know if any of these issues will clear up when I am switched to local storage or if I will start to have more issues.  Only time will tell.Update - 2 stars.  Time told.  I am into day one of local storage and I can't believe how petty Amazon is with the app if you aren't paying the subscription plus a couple of issues I have been dealing with the cameras and waited to mention to see if it would change with local storage.  The dealt with issues I think is with the cameras and not the app.  I have to go into live view every morning in order to get the cameras to record motion for the day.  I don't get it, it's like they go to sleep overnight when not a lot of action is happening.  Another thing I don't understand, is it will record a huge amount of cars driving down the street past the house, even in the block out zones, but will not record me passing in front of my house as I am coming and going or entering and leaving my drive.  Not that I am interested in myself, but makes me wonder what else is happening that doesn't get recorded.  Now for the pettiness of the app that wasn't too hot to begin with.  The dot that tells you if you have already viewed the clip, gone.  The ability to delete groups or all the clips at one time, quickly and easily, gone.  You have to delete them one at a time in the viewer, which closes after you delete the clip and you have to tap the next clip and wait for it to open the viewer and load the clip.  The thumbnails of the clips so you can see what was captured without having to view the clip, gone.  The ability to save live views, gone.I can not recommend these cameras which is a shame, as the cameras are pretty dang good as compared to others that I have had with the exception of a couple of bugs.  But it's the app that keeps me from paying for the plan and recommending this system to anyone.  What was once a mediocre app that caused frustration, has been reduced to a needlessly onerous turd of a chore that causes angst and regret.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2021"

I have consistently been waking up in the morning to review the videos from the night before and there are “live view” recordings. I did not get on the app in the middle of the night while asleep. I called blink customer service and they were not helpful at all. They told me the recordings are being initiated from my phone, so my phone must be hacked. Called Apple, they said it is highly unlikely that my phone is hacked. I’ve never had these issues with my ring camera, which also has live view vs. motion recordings. Don’t buy a blink camera.

823,A Reader,I dig my little camera,"  Super clear video during day,  but only works facing indoors at night. Facing it out a window does not work, it reflects off the glass not to mention you need some sort of light reflection for it to even give you video. All I could see was darkness and headlights going by my house. (Didn't matter how close you put it to the glass) Motion detection was great. The audio is so sensitive that it picks up the noise of the air around you, which makes it a little bit hard to understand voices if they aren't speaking loud. So it's great to talk to people through just fine but if you're spying on someone it can be a little bit irritating with the background whirring noise.

825,JB,Great for 3D Printing,"  I bought this camera in search for something budget friendly, and quality to watch my 3D prints. In the event something goes wrong mid print, I'd know about it because I can watch it away from home! This isn't much of a bother to me but the camera only allows you to view it for upwards of 30 seconds, unless you have a subscription with them, it will grant you access to their ""Extended Live View"" option which is in beta mode. That's with noting that they grant you free 30 Day access to this feature which is quite helpful because it gives you an idea of the subscription and what it brings, before you purchase or put a card on file. As for the picture quality, it's not bad for the use I have it for, but if you're looking for something to see further away, you won't be able to recognize much with this camera. Close up objects are a little easier to see (which would be obvious) but this could be a great ""Front Door"" camera, or exterior house camera to watch around the house. There is a ""Talk"" button with the camera as well, but I must note that this it's a little hard to speak with and hold a general conversation due to the cameras delay and how it cuts the audio of the entire camera when speaking. So as if someone was talking to speak back, you can't hear them so as you have the talk button pressed within the app. This is a small feature that I wouldn't bother nitpicking too much, but I am also using this to simply monitor 3D prints. All in all, great budget camera for the video quality, night vision quality, and the ability to watch it from anywhere. Will definitely be buying another for my other 3D printers!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2022"
826,Kyni Hartwell,I love this device - a MUST have if you have pets or children!,"  Ease of set up is VERY easy.This camera is not a terrific option for security because there is a clearly visible cord that needs to be plugged in to an electric outlet for power. However, I purchased this camera so that I can see my dog and my son when he returns home from school.I absolutely love that there is two-way communication. I can speak to my son while I'm at work.The picture quality is very good.The price is very inexpensive. I paid $49.99 but that includes the echo show 5.It comes with a bracket and two screws so that you can easily hang it on a wall. My only tiny complaint is the wall will block you from being able to adjust/raise the camera angle.My only other tiny complaint is there is a charge for cloud storage even if you're a prime member.

827,MNelson,Poo Patrol,"  So I purchased these indoor cameras to film from my window sill to hopefully capture the dogs responsible for me stepping in poo. So far, not much action. I think these cameras are great during the day time. I get notifications for motion all the way across the street. However at night I noticed lack of alerts which is odd because a lot of cars drive by as well as people walking should be more than enough to trigger the alert. I’ve figured out night vision is needed at night to improve motion detection. Unfortunately, since my camera films behind a window and screen, when I turn night vision on it just films a black screen since it’s unable to see through the screen with the night vision on. Luckily the controls allow you to modify and turn off night vision if need be. I’m okay with not getting as many alerts from across the street at night and when someone is on my side of the street I still get alerts about their movement which is what’s important. I’d recommend these cameras if you’re the type of person who is looking for a nanny cam or any kind of indoor cam. These would work great and it’s a great deal!

What is even more of a joke is that this ""feature"" only lasts 30 days, and then they want you to pay for a feature that MOST other cameras have for free. It's insane. Def wouldn't have wasted my money if I knew that basic features would only last a few weeks and then they expect you to pay for it.

I'm so glad I found this one because it works perfectly! Setup was easy; just plug in and download the app, then scan the barcode on the back and it connects. You can Arm/Disarm the motion detection from your phone, and so far it seems to capture and notify of each motion (even a little too well, via light moving on the wall from bright lights downtown). The sound/picture quality are great, and the speaker to talk back through the camera is loud and clear.

830,Courtney Trace,Basic for indoor,"  There’s no night time vision what’s so ever. That’s was very disappointing as I have my camera facing my driveway, as we know most people break in at night. The talk mode is like a walkie-talkie. You must hold the button while talking but you can’t hear the other person until you are done and let go of the talk button. Other than that it does a great detecting movement and alerting on my phone. It sucks when it goes off at night and it’s pointless. If you are looking for something that records all the time and can get views at night, go with a different camera.

831,Camila's,"Long time user of other blink cameras, these are JUNK!!","  UPDATE 5/19/20 - I was contacted by tech support shortly after writing this review and am currently running a beta firmware update that has fixed the issue. I commend them for finally paying attention and fixing the issue. Still wish they used the motion sensing technology used in previous cameras, as these are more temperamental.. still not consistently recognizing a person walking in room, but yet a change in sunlight during day will set it off.. or a fleck of dust at night.. but I hope that they will continue to get it dialed in. For now, I am changing my review from 1 star to 4.*ORIGINAL REVIEW*I have been in contact with technical support for weeks in regards to a bug or just plain crap that these new mini's are.. Basically, if I arm the cameras during the day, they will work, DURING THE DAY. If I arm them at night, they will work DURING THE NIGHT. Meaning they detect motion relatively well, but not nearly as sensitive even at highest sensitivity as XT at middle sensitivity. Should be opposite for always on camera. HOWEVER, and if I arm the system at night and then it becomes daytime and along with it daylight (funny how that happens Blink, there is a day and night in most places in the world) the cameras are not reliably (almost never) switching out of IR/night mode and also do not detect motion even if I literally jump up and down in front of them. This obviously makes them worthless. I'm not going to set an alarm at 6 am to wake up and manually disarm and then rearm. So lame.So not only does technical support not have any clue what they are doing and keep trying to tell me how to use the system, and offer up obvious solutions like turn on IR to auto, really?? duh.. how stupid of me. I even recorded a video showing exactly what is happening and sent it to them and 2 weeks later, no updates yet. I then submit an other ticket and, I'm answering the same questions over and over..So to make a long story short, DO NOT BUY THESE until Blink/Amazon takes this seriously and fixes this.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2020"

836,Marley Smith,Great value for the price!,"  Let me start off by saying for a $35 camera this does a pretty good job. I bought this to sit in my window to get a view of my front porch. NOTE THAT THIS WILL NOT WORK POINTING OUT OF A WINDOW AT NIGHT UNLESS THERE IS A SOURCE OF LIGHT OUTSIDE. It’s not really designed to do that, but I have a streetlight right outside my window so I am able to get clear shots at night time by turning the night vision function off. I also have it placed behind blackout curtains to reduce any glare from light from inside my house. I attached it to the side of the window sill using command strips as the stand is slightly too short to look over the window sill. This does a pretty good job for what it is. Yes, it is pretty limited as other people have noted. You are only able to record 30 seconds of motion and retrigger after 10 seconds which could cause you to miss some of the recording. One of my biggest complaints is that the storage is pretty limited. I live in a high traffic area with sidewalks and this picks up around 20-30 clips a day which can use up to 50 percent of the storage per day. However, you are able to go through and delete the ones you don’t need and can set it to automatically delete old clips. After messing around with the activity zones and sensitivity to what I feel are the best settings, I would say the motion sensor works correctly about 95 percent of the time. I haven’t had any problems with it not detecting motion, but instead capturing false motion from cars in the activity zones I have turned off and also occasionally the movement of shadows from the sun/clouds. Also the picture quality is pretty fair. It’s not ultra hd but also pretty easy to identify faces within a reasonable range. Overall, it does what I need it to do which is monitor my front door/porch area. I can’t say how well it functions with other blink cameras as this is the only one I’ve purchased but I plan on buying at least one more for other areas of my house.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2020"

The $3 a month plan for the camera to record once motion is detected has to be upgraded to the $10 a month plan, which is no biggie, but a pain to figure out how at first since you can’t do it through the Blink app. And when in the blink app, if you look at a camera, then want to “Arm Your System”, you’ll get a “Live View In Progress, Please Wait” error. You then have to close the app, and swipe it away in your task manager thingy, then reopen the app. Same thing if you want to switch to a different camera view. Over time when using it to watch pets or kids or whatever it may be, it becomes a big annoyance, and it has had this error for months and months now with no rush on fixing that issue, or anything at all in the app. The cameras are pretty good both day and night, but what’s the point if the software you use to look at your cameras is more annoying than helpful?",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2022"

I’m giving this a two because it doesn’t detect hardly anything. You have to be right up on it and sometimes it doesn’t even pick that up either. I switched from a SmartElf camera because I wanted something that was compatible with my many Amazon devices. Sometimes I’ll say “Alexa, arm the kitchen” and she’ll reply “kitchen doesn’t support that” so the connection between the camera and my device isn’t super strong: little disappointed with that too. I never had any issues with motion detection on my SmartElf but I don’t really want to go back to that either.

860,Mr. B. Hardie,Fun to play around with but now unplugged sitting in a drawer,"  Night vision was great when it worked but inconsistent. Sometimes it would turn on and sometimes it would not. Live view was disappointing. The software just seemed slow. Sometimes I had to change settings multiple times before the change would take effect. I would have loved if I could open the app and see a live view immediately. The recordings were nice but sometimes notifications would pop up late. Sometimes the camera wouldn't even activate when it really should have. All in all it seemed like there was so much that could have been done better. Due to my lackluster experience, I decided the value wasn't there and did not subscribe to the service. Might purchase the add-on for local storage in the future but I'm not compelled to based on my experience so far.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2022"

Unfortunately sometimes it seems to kind of fall asleep or something. So while it's working it's great - even records crossing bugs and spiders lol - but then sometimes it just doesn't respond. Today when I went out to walk the dog and then came back in it didn't catch either. Sometimes on the application the live video or even recorded video don't load or something. So it's not perfect.

Biggest issue is you can only view the camera using a cell phone app.  Those that work all day in the office on a laptop or desktop computer need a browser viewer to make this really useful, but I can't find one if it exists.  A buyer should be aware that even the cellphone viewer will stop something like after 30 seconds and you have to hit continue constantly.  Not useful for watching say a child.

865,DJB,Poor WiFi,"  Really wanted to like these.  They only support 2.4gHz frequency, not 5gHz wifi.  I have one in my living room and one in my back room, but the back room always hangs when trying to view live video, and I've woken up to it in a ""camera offline"" mode only to discover it's too far away from the router.  None of my other devices (esp those that can use the 5gHz band, shame on you Blink for not including this) have this problem, so it's likely they used cheap wireless components and it's a nice gimmick.  Wanted to like this product but going to have to return it since they're kinda useless if they don't connect to wifi.TL;DR - The wifi on these are very lackluster, so don't expect much in terms of distance.  The app will have trouble connecting to your camera, especially if you live in an apartment with other tenants who are presumably using the same 2.4 gHz band these operate on.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2020"

Manual reconnect requires you to totally delete it from the app and start from scratch.  Wifi is rock steady and very strong signal.  My Ring doorbell is on the same network and hasn't dropped wifi even once in a year - this Blink cam drops wifi several times a week.  This issue is with the camera. If I can't trust it to stay connected I can't trust it for security period.  If it occasionally dropped and reconnected it would be fine... But once it drops it's down for good until you manually reconnect it.  Amazon won't replace or allow me to return (after only 60 days), forced me to have a phone call with Amazon customer service and then put me on hold before they eventually disconnected.

I got it so people will see I have a camera that is recording them, but not have them be able to disable the camera in any way.

878,Corey V,inability to auto-transition from night to day so will not detect motion,"  While the camera will transition from day to night, the Blink mini (firmware 9.70) will not transition from night to day. Even with sufficient light on in the room with sunrise, the IR sensor remains on and motion is not detected so recording does not happen. Even at night if a light is turned on in the room, the camera will not transition from IR sensing to daylight mode and so will not detect motion. A security camera foiled by turning on a light! Evidently this is a long running issue with this mini camera as it was reported over a year ago now.It seems not fit for purpose.The only ways to work around this seem to be:1. Manually trigger a photo, live view, or disarm and immediately re-arm. This takes manual intervention and must be timed with sufficient day light in the space.2. Set a schedule to disarm and then rearm the camera. This results in at least 15 minutes of potentially lost recordings since schedules can only be set at 15 minute increments. (Maybe an Alexa routine can do this automatically with less of a gap in recording?)3. Turn off night vision mode and rely on a secondary light. So keep the camera in normal daylight mode at all times. Some use a separate motion detection light to turn on so that recording at night can still work.None of these seem like good enough solutions.Called support today and they said they were aware and working on the issue, but had no estimate on when it would be resolved. Maybe after a year of this being a known issue they can't resolve it at all?",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2021"

880,GregM,"Once you have to pay for a subscription, activations become sketchy. **Plus an update**","  **Update** So a Blink rep contacted me after I posted this review and wrote that it was obvious that the blink mini was not working properly at all and that there was probably a problem with the unit. Though my goal was only to get the camera to work as promised, or get a replacement, the rep upgraded our blink mini to either the Indoor or Outdoor camera. We chose the outdoor and received it, and the synch hub within a couple days. I had to take a star away from my initial review because since connecting the camera, it has not worked properly. There were no activations- even when I stood right in front of and even touched the camera! What?! Then, things changed. Around 5pm, activation after activation notice started blowing up my phone. When reviewing the near 50 clips this morning, only one showed anything- a clip of the night sky quickly turning to bright blue. Literally nothing else was in the clip. I continue to get clips of nothing, but when I know people have walked in front of the camera because I see them, there is no recording. No activation. No protection. I emailed the rep over 5 hours ago asking for direction and help to make sure everything was connected and updated and whatever correctly on my end, but have heard nothing back yet. I saw a review that said to hang in and wait for 24 hours because he had similar issues. After 24 hours, he said his camera basically fixed itself and started working as promised. Well, this new camera's 24 hours is almost up and I have yet to see any improvements in service. Very annoying and makes me feel scammed.I really wanted to love this camera- especially since being able to get it at a great price. At the start, activations were not always good- sometimes the camera would send recorded clips that showed nothing in frame that would have activated it, or would not be activated at all when people were standing right in front of the camera. Once we had to pay for the subscription service, quality plummeted. I tried everything I could find online- google, reddit, blink's help hub to no avail. I tried facing the camera inside and would walk around in front of it and it was only a 50/50 chance that it would pick up even that movement. I tried all kinds of lighting conditions, placements, and suggestions that I found and thought of before finally contacting customer support. After about a bajillion activations during the time period I gave them access to my camera, they said everything looked fine. They also said that my account showed numerous activations so that it seemed as though the camera was constantly recording-  all during the time period in which they were in the account! Had they viewed the previous months, they would have seen that this was not the issue I was asking for help with and explaining over and over. At the end of a few days and numerous emails and no fixes or workable solutions or suggestions, they blew me off and sent me a CS satisfaction survey. So in all, since they've already gotten their money, they would no longer help me. I complied with/tried everything they said, am technically savvy, and now am just mad that I lost money on a shoddy camera and very shoddy subscription service.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2021"

Overall for 35$ It’s a steal.Would recommend if needed for something small or something to check when the kids get home, or something that isn’t necessary for a legit security system.

898,Adam,Good little security camera,"  I bought the blink camera with my Echo Show for $5.00, I thought what the heck, even if it's bad it's only $5.00. Wow, was I surprised at the quality of the camera and the picture. I am very happy with this camera, there is only one draw back, it does not rotate. This is the reason for 4 stars, other than that it is very good. The night vision quality is excellent. I will definitely  purchase another one, this time I will go with the battery operated one, the plug in is kind of a pain and limits where you can put it.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2022"
899,F. Adger,5/10 type of camera.,"  It’s great for the price, and great quality. The only cons is; It makes a clicking noise when you view it and another click when you stop viewing. So it wake up my dog when I try to view her, literally opposite of what I’d want. It also has a light when viewing, but luckily you can turn that off in settings. The other con is the set up, Everytime it is unplugged or wifi cuts out for a moment, you have to set up the camera AGAIN.  I wouldn’t want to own multiple, and then scanning each one AGAIN and then input wifi info.  Other than that it’s very decent for the price.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2021"

I couldn’t get a 90 degree angle like I could with the outdoor cameras and couldn’t mount the camera high enough to get the coverage I wanted.

Thank goodness I got this camera for $5 but I’m still thinking of returning it. It randomly switches to night vision at 4:15 pm and it’s still quite bright at that time. The motion sensor is a little iffy and it takes a bit to record once motion is detected. I have included a night vision picture. For background my bedroom windows are next to a street light yet the picture is pitch black. The room is nowhere near as dark in real life. The blue color to the left is a bottle of hand sanitizer.

Now in the daylight it is great. At night that is a different story because we have it in a window and if someone or something sets it off, you get the glare of the camera from the window so you cant see what set it off or who. there is a setting so it don't go off like if the wind is blowing tree leaves or something like that. Also it will go off if a car goes down the street. but again it has a setting you can set for a certain distance.

I have two cameras connected and it was difficult for me to understand that what I really wanted to do, the software does not allow it. I should have called tech support because the two things I was trying to do is the least a person looks for when buying a camera:1) notifications: If you want the camera to record movements to be able to review later, you must allow notifications to your phone. That means that every time there is a movement your phone will ring. If you turn off the notifications, the camera stops recording.  You can block notifications for the entire application (in the settings of your phone), but you will not be able to leave any camera (if you have more than one) with notifications2) Live view: If you want to watch live, it only allows you to do it for a few seconds. There is no way to set to watch live for more than a few seconds.The answer of the support team is that it is a surveillance camera (I did not understand what difference that from an Eufy or other cameras that are better configurable)",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2021"

910,Knightcrawler,Terrible as a baby monitor,"  I bought these cameras to replace a mix of Yi and Wyze cams that we used as monitors for our small children. I figured it would be nice to standardize on one system and thought Amazon does things well so I went for it. Turns out, these are terrible as monitors. The audio constantly plays a white noise sound as if we have the kids’ sound machines on. The night vision is not very good. The video also times out after about 30 seconds so you can’t leave the app open to just watch whatever you’re pointing your camera at (e.g. checking to see when your napping child wakes up). Also, with Yi and Wyze I could insert a micro SD card to enable local storage and view playback— not an option with Blink. They’ve got a lot to learn.

The advertising is slightly misleading and this camera does not work with the Amazon cloud cam app. Since you cannot purchase the Amazon cloud cam anymore, I went with Geeni cam instead which lets you record on an SD card.

When viewing live there is a pretty significant lag and it almost always just stops recording before the time is up for live view and sometimes the live view doesn't work, rendering the live view useless. This camera has taken awhile for me to gain enough experience with it to realize it is not useful for security at all since you have to learn, over time, just how much it really misses.

It’s okay in the sense that you can use the app, see what’s happening live with just a slight couple second delay and even talk through them. My issue is, I also bought the echo at the same point to hook them up to it. It wouldn’t work and said it wasn’t supported. I then try to set the sensitive to give me motion alerts when someone approaches the front door. If the sensitivity isn’t at its max, it doesn’t alert me to anything. And if it is at its max, it detects nothing but I’ve had people walk up my front steps to deliver packages, food, etc. and I get no notifications. It’s nice to see sometimes when I want to check in and make sure all is well and it definitely added peace of mind when we were gone for a week. I just wish the Blink performed the way I hoped.

944,Ryan A,Disappointed,"  Writing another review since my last one was deleted.Camera works decently, but like others have said this is bait and switch.Blink subscriptions were not needed when I first purchased the camera and now I am being told I’m on a trial. That’s not fair to those that were promised we wouldn’t need one. In all actuality, that’s why many purchased Blink because most cameras require subscriptions.The least they could’ve done if they wanted to start charging is to make that announcement for those who purchased it after a certain time.

I love that it has a two-way talk function, so if I happen to check in to see if my son is doing his particular assignment, and see that he’s not, I can gently remind him to get back to work.When we are able to travel once again, the camera will a be great way to keep an eye on things at home from my phone.

Maybe this is on my end but I do wish the motion detection was a bit more accurate- in that sometimes it shows my dog in a position that they other clips don’t lead to. There seems to be missing detections, but again that may be on the user’s end of the app. The actually picture is great and the two way speaker option is a nice option. I will say that the sound detection isn’t that great - there’s always a bit of a hum or high pitch white noise during the videos.

963,Rackon,Not a suitable baby monitor,"  I received the Blink Mini as a bundle with an Echo Show 5 for Christmas. My intention was to use it as a monitor for my 4 year old son. The picture quality is great! The Alexa integration also works pretty well. However, I quickly discovered as many people have, that they w is no option to continuously view the camera. It has not even occurred to me that this would not be an option, since it has a constant power source. Also, the camera makes an audible clicking sound when it begins recording & has a red IR light on the front that also turns on. You apparently can not turn this light off, even though there is an option to do so within the app. Toggling the light off in the app does nothing. My son became immediately aware of both of these factors & the result is that he was petrified to move the rest of the night. I didn’t realize this until the next morning, because the motion sensor is also pretty unreliable. My son got out of bed & left his room without seeing it off. It may be acceptable as a monitor for a small child, but certainly not an infant & without a continuous view option, you must rely on a hit or miss motion detector.

I haven't tried to use it to view out of a window so I can't comment on that.

973,Tim,Good indoor camera for the price,"  I bought these to replace a couple of other WIFI cameras that were beginning to fail. The setup is quick and easy. I especially like the motion alert zones configuration which allows a lot of flexibility in areas to detect and report motion as well as the sensitivity. One con, and not a huge one, is that there is no local storage, everything is cloud-based and requires a re-occurring fee after 1 year from purchase. The renewal fees are not much, hence being a rather small ""con"". Another missing feature, one that I had gotten used to with my previous cameras, was the ability to ""slide and select"" motion events and go to specific times within those events. That's not a con, per se, just a difference in from one app to the next. That could possibly be added in subsequent revisions of the software if the developers so chose to implement.

He has dementia and is very bipolar and unpredictable and nobody is home except for him for at least 6 hours out of the day. I got this camera to make sure he doesn’t snoop around and so far everything has been kosher. camera works great the audio is not the greatest on the two way feature but the product does what it’s advertised.

But don't buy this camera unless you're ok with having to push ""continue"" every 30 seconds to keep live view open.It's an app feature limitation, 1st set up bc the camera was battery operated and got too hot. New ones are AC powered, and this feature request is all over the Web and blink forums for years.Here on amazon it's packaged with Echo Show for cheap and NONE of the many reviews I read her mentioned it at all. According to reviews everywhere else but here, it's not an ideal baby monitor for this reason, but the price draws parents in since camara's titled ""baby monitors"" are 3-4x as much. But unless you want to press continue every 30 seconds for the hour your baby naps, while trying to get out emails or be on meetings, I recommend spending a few more dollars and go with a couple other options.

It will also begin recording for most moving shadows near the closed door, but not when someone walks by the camera to the door.

There is an op-source project to develop one, but the Blink development team has no current plans to create one - they are a small team and are currently working on new features for the phone app instead.- The feed keeps dropping/stuttering or failing to connect ALL THE TIME!!!  I have 500 MBps Internet - the drops are on Blink's/Amazon's servers.- Even if you happen to get a stable/good connection, the app asks you if you want to remain connected every 30 seconds - annoying as hell!I am happy enough with the device that I won't be returning it only because I got a good deal on it.

However, it only has 10 seconds of motion recording which won’t work for certain areas of home or office.For example, blink camera sucks as the camera for your garage My Q system. It doesn’t integrate with My Q so it can not be controlled when you are in My Q app. It works well with Alexa, but you can’t view it on Ring. So it will work for Key and it has a motion sensor when your garage door opens, but it won’t record continuously. You only get 10 seconds of motion. So you can see your garage go up and feet or ankles and when it comes down, but you would have to actually go to live view to see what’s happening, if you can catch it (Amazon delivery must be trained by elves or Santa himself because they are quick).  I don’t know about you, but I want everything recorded if someone is coming in my garage to leave a package.

1034,wishiwereinitaly,Great addition to our blink system.,  I have the outdoor cameras and we love how easy they are to use.  I purchased the mini to use in my daughter's bedroom like a baby monitor.  It works so much better than the camera we previously had that was designed as a baby monitor the only thing I wish it had was a continual view option.  This camera isn't set up to be a continuous monitor you can only watch for a few moments at a time.  The picture quality is great and I still prefer it over the original monitor we had.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2020"
1035,Mark,So so,"  They take a minute to hook up to the wifi...and I don't like that a bright blue light comes on when your watching the live stream-it alerts the person on the other end that they are being watched. There is also a definite 6 second delay with the sound... hate it. Also don't like that I can only watch for 30 sec at a time.On the other hand, it detects the motion, records what it should, has good night vision, does have 2 way voice capabilities, and works.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2021"
1036,Kim,Frustrating,"  Overall, it isn’t the picture quality isn’t horrible. The motion detector is nonexistent. The actual live view will last about 20 seconds before it tries to save a video. Bought to watch baby while he is in bassinet, but we have to hit the continue button…which doesn’t always work….every 20 or so seconds. If not coughs in time, video stops and you have to wait for the live view to load again. Loading takes a long time, anything can happen to baby at that point. The video also stops when you try to zoom in. Also, only one person can view at a time. My husband and had to make sure one of us closed out the app in order for the other to use it.

You get 5 minutes (sometimes less) before the connection times out and you have to have Alexa restart the feed.This is utterly impractical, and makes us feel like we made a mistake buying this camera and the Echo Show.The frustrating part is that this seems like it would be so easy to fix with a simple software update.

1040,greg white,Great When It Works,"  My first Treasure Truck purchase and it’s great when it works. Bought for use to view those coming up to our department. When it does work, the motion detection is highly sensitive and we get immediate alerts. Picture quality is okay but not top notch. Forget about night vision if you have this facing a window to the outdoors unless you enjoy watching partial clips of the dark and the camera’s reflection on the glass.Live view is nice to have if you need to check things out during the day and pretty useless at night.

Was perfect until the free trial, that I didn't even know about, ran out. Other cameras, different brands, we have purchased in the past came with free video clips up to a certain time frame (usually 24 hrs) then were deleted. If I wanted to save clips I had the option to purchase cloud storage. Not Blink!! I was not aware there was no free temporary cloud storage until it was too late to return.

They were unhelpful even after hours of explaining what wasn't working and their directions for required changes to wifi and the app. They continually blamed everything but their lousy piece of equipment.

After only two weeks both of my cameras stopped working and after several different attempts to reboot them I finally managed to get them back on only to find my ""free"" blink app subscription was expired and I had lost 80 percent of the cameras features.

This is basic feature on some cameras so hoping for an upgrade soon that addresses this.  Seems simple to add""  Since posting this review, customer service reached out to me quickly and we discussed this concern; they pushed a software update that gave me this option.  Motion detection allows me to map what areas to monitor for movement, however does not always pick up motion.  It does pick up larger motion outside of the mapped area which seems odd.

Up until now I have always used google nest so I was hoping this would be a decent replacement and I would buy more for other rooms. The camera quality isn’t bad. I was actually impressed for a $35 camera. The app is awful and likely going to be the reason I return this. It is not user friendly. There are too many settings for the camera that most people probably don’t know what all the options mean. When you open the app it shows a blank box where you can add a picture. It should show the live stream there. Why would I want a stale picture of the room? The only way to get video playback to my knowledge, is when you have the camera armed. But then you get notifications for every moment which is unnecessary.

1078,terrence kelly,Great product for a great price,"  The camera is amazing for the price that it has. The night vision is great, the motion detection is also very accurate. The app should have some more functionality heeded towards this specific product as it mainly focuses on the other cameras from the same brand.Two cons are that you need to select continue viewing every 30 seconds if attempting to watch a live video. The other issue is that the camera makes this EXTREMELY LOUD shutter sound when you go to access the app. I live in a two story house and bought this to watch my dog downstairs and there are times when I switch between the live view and the previous recordings I can literally hear the shutter from the second floor when the camera is downstairs. It’s bad to the point in which my dog has woken up a few times and that’s really a bummer. I’ve tried checking in on him and in doing so I wake him up because accessing the app causes the loud noise on the actual camera that’s downstairs.Aside from these two things, really great camera with a great price point",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2020"

1080,Tiffany A.,"Good, Cheap, Little Cameras.",  These are great little indoor cameras. The motion detection is ok but it does miss things. I wish they would record more than 30 seconds at a time and without a 10 second minimum retrigger time. Picture quality is pretty good for things close up to the camera but as you get further away the picture starts to degrade. It's good for small and average sized rooms. The Blink app still sucks and unfortunately these cameras use that app. Overall they work good and do what they're designed to do and that is to pick up motion. They're not baby monitors so don't go buying these thinking that they will constantly stream video to your tablet while you sleep.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2020"

There is some distortion of the peripheral video area (fish eye lens effect), but this is unavoidable due to the wide view angle.  You have to be fairly close to the unit to trigger the motion sensor, and there is some false triggering when the sunlight level coming through the windows changes, but overall, it does everything I need it to do and the price was right.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2021"

When you click on the app to see the video the camera makes a clicking noise. That with the red light being on and a blue light when it detects motion makes this less than ideal to watch a baby.

1090,David J. Beranek,You have to pay for a subscription to use!!!,"  Honestly, We loved the Blink camera when we first purchased it. The storage was really confusing because it sounded as if you only had a small amount to use and if it exceeded the limit it would start recording over the saved video clips. That actually was fine for us and we enjoyed using it until the free trial ran out. Now it will notify us of movement but NOT record anything! The plan now requires a subscription of 3.00 a month per camera OR 10.00 a month for unlimited cameras. Well.... we only have 2 cameras and they are not worth paying 6.00 a month just to video a 10 sec. clip!!!!! Sadly, I was so happy with them I was telling everyone about them and even purchased 2 for my elderly parents!!!!

When looking at the app, you have to continually refresh after 45 or so seconds or stop and hit the continue button to keep playing the feed.

I bought these to use as baby monitors because I have twins, and most other monitors with 2 cameras get expensive. Plus, we have several alexas, so I thought these would be great. The camera is good quality, and the night vision works really well too. I tried the motion sensor because one baby somehow always ended up in random places in the crib, and my husband and I wanted to see how he was doing it, but I guess it was such small movements the camera wouldn’t trigger. My biggest complaint, though, is that too often I’ll try to look at my babies, and I get a long delay...just a spinning wheel...followed by “system is busy try again later”...no. I want to see my babies now please...try again, same thing. Or it’ll say “live preview in progress please wait” or something like that...I’ve also tried to turn off the little light because I feel like my babies see it which negates the purpose of using it to check if they’re asleep...Like I said, I know not every product is for every person, and this one just wasn’t for me.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2021"

Using the app to load a new camera was extremely easy as well, I had four cameras installed and functioning on the app in less than an hour. The clarity of the pictures in the listing are what you actually get, but there is also some steady background noise in the live view. When the cameras are activated there is a noticeably audible click when recording starts and when the lights turn off and it switches to night mode. In the common areas of your house this shouldn't be an issue. If you have pets in your bedroom at night, though, it could be constantly clicking going on and off during the night unless you shut the camera off, which defeats the security purpose.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2020"

1174,Heather  & Shannon G.,Giving Up!!!,"  When the cameras work they are okay, for cheap cameras.  After ordering my 2nd and 3rd cameras, I realized my 1st camera continued to go offline.  I constantly have to reset it and connect it to Wifi.  Additionally, after attempting to cancel the free trial and start paying for the monthly service, which is the only way the cameras can do their job, Amazon appears to be unable to comply with this request.  Maybe I am too tech savvy for Amazon!  I am giving up.  It is more trouble than it is worth.  With all of the issues with Amazon lately, I am thinking about cancelling all of my accounts with Amazon.  They do not have REAL 2 day shipping anymore, for anything.

1176,Amazon Customer,"Nice cameras for the price, but...","  So these cameras are ok, the picture quality is very good.  The biggest issue I had is with the motion detection, either you have to have it very sensitive and get notified of a breeze or less and someone could walk up to it with no notification.  I prefer the Nest cameras that can tell the difference between a person and motion.  These are a great price abc if you can get the settings right for your home then even better.

You get 5 minutes per view, and have to hit ""continue"" twice during the 5 minutes. I've has regularly had issues opening the live stream with errors worded something like ""live stream in process"" or ""camera unavailable"" so you have to wait and try again.

1181,daninha21,Won't save without Blink plan,"  The motion sensing is a bit hit or miss. Microphone isn't the greatest. Setup is super easy; however, if you don't spring for the plan it won't save recording, and I mean at all. Meaning if you get an alert on your phone, unless you look immediately it's useless. Actually, it might still be useless as I've never actually caught it on my phone after the initial plan expired.

I bought a package that included an Echo Show 5 and the Blink Mini, which was a great value as it brought the price down of the Blink Mini to about $5.  I did not have high expectations.  I was pleasantly surprised with the ease of set-up, the quality and the fact that even though I did not notice this, it appears to have pre-record/roll-back.  When motion is detected and you play the video back, you can see what is going on prior to the motion-activating event.  This is different than other cameras.  The sound and video quality are great as well.  This is a great compliment to other Blink cameras, the app, and works very well with Alexa.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2020"
1183,PMC,Good for the price,"  The quality is good for what you pay. The night vision isn't really all the great for me.

I’m able to easily move them around into different rooms when I want to and set up was also very easy. My kids like them because they can see when I’m on the camera from the blue light that appears and automatically start talking to me. The picture quality isn’t HD but definitely worth what I paid for it. I can even point them outside my front window to pick up on motion when I’m not home and they have worked well for that.

1185,Kevin Braun,Doesn’t offer the options Wyze has and it costs more.,"  I’ve been wanting to try out indoor cameras for a while. I was between Wyze and this one. Ultimately decided for blink mini because it had the option of getting the cameras on a monthly payment so I could get all the cameras I needed at once. So far the experience is good with the camera. Very easy to set up, I have the echo show and it is super fast to show the picture compared to Wyze or my nest cam. Only downfall is that unlike Wyze it’s only playback of motion or you can live view only in short increments. I don’t mind paying for a service but I need a service that is continually playback and live view whenever, this does not offer that. You have to click live view button and then it won’t stay on that screen for long. I’m sure this could be an update just in software, but it’s simply not there. Compared to spending less money and and having all these features rn Wyze is the better option. I’ll give these cameras a bit more time hopefully they will update their app and software but for rn if you’re considering this cam vs a Wyze. This is not the winner.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2020"

I would say dint go in expecting it to be a great security camera and you can catch people stealing your stuff. But what it does is gives you a snap shot of what’s going on with in the camera range of view and decent sound quality.

I was hesitant bc of some of the reviews but honestly I’ve had it for a few weeks now and it’s working great. I can talk to my dog through it, the night vision is alright for the price, motion detection is accurate. It only gives you one month of free recordings but I’ll just bite the bullet and buy the membership thing. It works really well for the price. The setup was a little difficult, BUT i realized most of these bad reviews were probably if you have already slow internet and a lot of devices on the WiFi. The app is okay! But beware when you arm it it will send you notifications for EVERY MOVEMENT! It doesn’t bother me but i know some would get annoyed. Im glad i purchased this, it’s serving it’s job and hopefully it will keep doing so. I recommend for the price and if you’re looking for something cheap and affordable. It’s definitely not a high definition security camera but it’s not bad. The feedback on the mic is a little loud, but i also have it set up by the AC.

So it seemed I would only be able to watch live feed if I did not purchase cloud space. With saying all that I did not have high hopes.Was easy to set up. Upon setting it up I realized it has its own storage space. So that problem is solved.I set it in window near the front door.

It gives me some piece of mind.  I focused the camera on the sump pump area and all i have to do is open the app and view a live picture of the area.

For the same money I can get another brand (like Wyze) that can hold an SD card and allow me to go back and view old footage. There is no option for 24 hour continuous recording.

1232,William C. Gens,I wouldn’t get another one,"  I mean, it does it’s job and the camera itself seems fine. It’s just that the app is so frustrating to use.It’s slow and laggy, and it doesn’t allow two people to view the screen at once. Because of this, if I close and try to reopen the live view too quickly, it’ll lag and think someone is still watching and not let me in. I have to completely close down the app and reset it in order to open the live view again. It’s also super annoying that it’ll automatically kick me out of live view after thirty seconds if I don’t keep pressing “continue viewing”.At first I thought hey, it’s because it’s a cheap camera and I get what I pay for… but then I tried another camera around the same price range (blurams), and it is just SO much better in every way.

Unfortunately, it is just a way to nickel and dime somebody by paying for the subscription to save the video clips after the free subscription ends.

I ordered a two-pack and one was just a brick - wouldn't work at all, and the other had such a skewed/stretched/distorted view once it was hooked up and working that I think there must have been a manufacturing defect in the lens. Housing quality is much thinner and cheaper plastic than earlier versions. These new cameras do not come with any remote storage like they used to (Amazon getting greedy). They are not sturdy at all. If you place one in a certain position, within minutes gravity will take over and move the position of the camera until it is pointing down in about 5 minutes. Also, with the app there is no way to view a camera continuously for more than 30 seconds at a time. That is a terrible oversight. I know Amazon is pushing these very cheaply, but you really get even less than you pay for here.

The app is sub par and prone to crashing and having issues. It’s clunky and, in my opinion, not user friendly.The only pro of this camera is the night vision.

1273,Simay entz,Crap,"  This thing has huge chunks of time where it doesn’t record even though we have it set to record all the time. It is a pain in the butt to set up, way more errors than other systems. You cannot get anyone to answer the phone to help you if you have any issues. They have a customer service number that literally never gets answered.

1274,Jonathan Texas,Do not buy it!,"  I bought this camera to be able to see my cat when I’m not home. However, I have run into some issues with this camera. One, the camera only allows one person to see the live view. Which can be annoying if my other family members want to see the live. Two, is not able to capture when my cat moves. Which I don’t even understand why. Thirdly, I bought this camera because I could be at work and talk to my cat through the camera. However, this feature stop working after my free subscription ran out. Now I’m not able to communicate with the people in the room through the camera. Weirdly the audio does get recorded in the blink app. I honestly bought this camera for those reasons and now I’m so disappointed with the camera. This is the first review that I have ever written on Amazon because I honestly want you guys to look at better cameras instead of buying this one. It’s not worth it.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2022"
1275,orlando,REQUIRES SUBSCRIPTION,"  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS CAMERA. If you’re being forced to pay a monthly fee for a camera then you might as well get one of the higher quality options out there. I only saw the subscription requirement after I bought it. It should be featured more prominently. The quality is not worth a monthly fee.Furthermore, there have been times when I’ve realized it has turned itself off. It still says armed but I know when someone has been in the apartment all day and still no notifications from blink. I have also found that the notifications are often significantly delayed. For instance, I received a notification that someone had entered the apartment. I go to live immediately and they are already gone when I know they were in there for at least 15/20 minutes. Sometimes literally anything will set this camera, like light passing through the room. It’ll send me notifications all day long about reflections on the wall. Now it’ll notify me of movement but doesn’t record because I don’t have their plan. Lastly, the camera must be plugged it. It does not hold a charge.It also came damaged, which should have been my first hint. This blink box came in a larger Amazon box which was totally fine. So I know someone grabbed the damaged item and stuck it in the Amazon box.Do not waste your time and money.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2021"

1277,Angie,Poorly designed,"  Although the product is not design to monitor non-human activities, but motion should be motion. In a setup along a hall way about 5 feet wide, 5 cameras placed in W positions, only 1 or 2 cameras captured the object. The test has been carried out for many days, always randomly picked up by a few cameras and no triggering by the others.Beside the poor motion detection, the lack of continuously recording is a major drawback. Don't understand why Blink sets itself a limit of 60 seconds of short clips only in recordingThird, the time period for live feed is very limited (10 seconds or so).Blink should warn the buyer for eliminated those common features that are commonly perceived by default.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2022"
1278,Angie,Unreliable!!!,"  This was a great product for checking in on my pups, but when my puppy starting experiencing bouts of separation anxiety and destroying his crate, it was pertinent to have access to this camera so I could talk to him and calm him down. However, this camera is just an unreliable piece of junk! You’d think something connected directly power would never have issues, but this camera continuously disconnects randomly for no reason. Also if exit out of the camera and try to get back in, there’s quite the delay to do so.

1280,Bert Snert,Informative review,  Pretty good picture. Not significant detail at distance as expected from a small camera for live feed but the picture IS incredible. Pairs with the Echo Show 5 wonderfully. You see the blink camera live feed display onto the screen on the amazon echo which is cool to always check in on your camera from comfort. You can also check the feed on your phone and choose to take photos and videos. It also records when the motion detection takes place and it displays no light when it does this so it’s very discreet as to have no flashing light while the motion detector goes off. It goes straight to the app you can check on your phone. You can speak through the tiny blink camera and it is somewhat quiet but completely comprehensible. The night vision does work great even when motion detector has no light on. With light on in the room the picture quality is great!

Unless Blink comes up with a huge update,  there's no setting to change the 30 sec timeout.The quality and sensitivity as well as night vision are fantastic.

And cars drive in view about every ten minutes so I know it's not for lack of movement. The ""'night vision"" is also just an extra light that turns on but if you have the camera set up indoors facing a window, the light will just reflect back on itself.

1325,Amazon Customer,Does not record longer than ten seconds.,"  I was initially excited for this purchase to update our interior camera and add external cameras. Although the cameras are so easy to install and offer you a great picture, I am HIGHLY disappointed in their recording features. The cameras can only record a maximum of 10 seconds clips of the initial motion. Then, they shut off for a few seconds, and if motion is detected, start up again, only to record another 10 second clip. This causes bits and, sometimes crucial pieces of what you were trying to record, to be missing. Terrible. The cameras only record if they are “armed.” And you have to scroll through ALL of the individual clips to maybe find what you’re looking for.My last camera system, similarly priced and about the same price per month, would record continuously and give you time stamps of the entire motion on a timeline- allowing you to catch what happened. AND they rotated. I primarily use the camera to monitor my dog, however we recently had a baby and there was an incident where he was injured and nobody could tell me what happened and went to check the cameras, and what do you know.? They were disarmed.Highly dissatisfied and disappointed with the features and just want back my old cameras.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2021"

The main reason I’m actually doing the review. The sound quality sucks. In every camera, indoor wired and  outdoor wireless, all have a noise that sounds like a fan is blowing into it. I can’t hear movement I can’t hear people talking. If I’m just checking in, I can’t hear nothing. It’s usually the live feed that has this problem.

1376,Kevin Pruett,Does NOT work the way it should without a subscription,"  I had to purchase a few of these cameras in order to ensure the security of my home. I did not have a problem purchasing the module and the accessories needed to make the units function as a whole. Everything was perfect once I installed everything and started using the system (during the subscription free trial). Once the free trial expired everything went to heck. Clips stopped being recorded and overall USB functionality went to crap. The cameras constantly lose connection and fail to record important clips. I personally do not want security footage of the inside of my home stored in the cloud, hence the reason I do not want a cloud subscription. Therefore, I do not recommend the purchase of this product unless you intend to pay the monthly fee to have your videos saved on some server that any decent hacker can access.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2022"
1377,Scott,Mini Blink,"  I would give this a 5 star rating except in the few short weeks I have had it, the blink mini seems to go offline everytime I try to speak thru the speaker.  I think only once it did not.  So I love it as it was an easy set up and it's easy to use it's just if I want to speak thru it, it will put me offline for a few hours before coming back online.  So that is the only thing I can't use.  But for the price its a great little camera and I am actually thinking of buying a second one for the living room.  Again, just wish the speaker would work and not throw me offline.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 5, 2020"
1378,Dana K,Blink knowingly shipping cameras that don't work.,"  Extremely disappointed in the Blink Mini.  The motion sensor doesn't work correctly right out of the box. After searching Blink's website for answers I found they are aware of a firmware issue and are working on a fix. However, the issue has been known for months and no expected repair date was given.  I think it's terrible that Blink an Amazon company would sell customers a product they know isn't going to work as advertised. The Blink Mini should be pulled from the market until it has been fixed.Update I am changing my reviews to 4 stars. The camera still doesn't work as intended and I do think Blink should stop selling these until there is a fix. However Blink's costumer support has been excellent in responding to the issue. They did acknowledge there is an issue they are working and offered to send us a different model at no charges to make up for our problems. So customer support earned Blink 3 more stars from me. I would now recommend  buying from Blink.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2020"

This is true amazon decided to remove the free storage on these cameras after months of touting free storage for life. Nowhere did it mention the free storage was being removed at the time of my purchase or I would have went with something else or a better camera as a needed a cheap set up for a room to monitor a toddler.

When live-view does load, it's slow to continuously update and is more like a slideshow of one frame every 3-4 seconds.

1430,Rachel S,Easy setup recommended for minimalist w/o sacrificing quality.(.used with echo),"  Easy setup. Super easy. Good quality for a little guy. Like option of how much to record time wise after motion is detected (with guard on). Really cool that you can listen in with minimum ""white noise"" (. I use with my echo (8) which I love except the no apps feature, but rather ""skills"" to ""learn"" -- is hard to get used to)Everything is easily adjusted and controlled within alexa app. Plugs in for use on nightstand etc or  mount it. Look live from app anytime and hit record to save a recording or auto saves certian amount of time if motion detected and guard is on. Great for the minimalist who doesnt like having to read a book and get a headache trying to set something like this up .

Only thing wrong with it is that it stops detecting motion at random times during the night. Sometimes doesn't detect motion for over 12 hours!

1445,Amazon Customer,Good camera - poor storage options,"  The camera works great, as far as functionality goes. It's 2021, so a camera with good quality video shouldn't be a surprise or worthy of 5 starts on that alone. The lack of an option to store recorded videos to a local device/local storage is just inexcusable. You can't really get by without using the subscription service so you're paying every month just for the ability to review videos. Add a real local storage option. Not one that needs additional hardware and is handicapped by an arbitrary update/download schedule.

After a couple of weeks I noticed they weren't recording any motion, the live view was still good but no recording.  Talked to Blink and we reset the sensitivity to high (#9).  This did the trick for a couple of days. Starting picking up everything. 20 to 30 videos of flies, moths, light movements and sometimes with no movement at all.  Now passed 3 camera on the way out of house and no recordings from any camera.  Stood right in front of camera from 10 inched to 10 feet and nothing.Very unreliable.

It records movement in 15 second clips and saves them for later review. Picture quality and nightvision are great. Also, it has integration with Alexa so I can use my Echo Show to monitor the camera. The only negative that I find is that it can’t be used for continuous monitoring as the video stops after 30 seconds and have to press a button to continue watching for another 30 seconds or back out and go back in to the feed.

Doesn’t pick up motion very well at all (I have a cat that keeps coming into my shop, I put the camera about 3 feet above the food I set out for it and it didn’t pick the cat up.) Playback is awful, if it does pick up motion it only records for a second, literally.

You have to turn off night vision and keep a light (like a porch light) on so the camera can see. But it gets rid of the night vision glare problem. :) For just viewing your front door or back door (or both) it’s a great camera! hope that helps! Also, the basic subscription fee is $30 per year.

Recording options are minimal. The maximum you can record is 30 seconds at a time only. It means that even if the motion continues system will stop recording automatically. Also, after each set of recordings, there is a minimum of 10 seconds of gap/interval or retrigger time. These 10 seconds of the gap are good for the intruder but not for the victims.I don't recommend blink cameras at all unless Amazon gives the option of continuous recording.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2021"

First, if the electrical plug has the USB plug going out the end of the plug rather than in the top/bottom, which would make the plug fit way better behind furniture.  Second, it would have been great if the product were offered in black rather than just white.  Third, and most disappointing/surprising, one needs to use IFTTT (rather than just the Alexa app) to create a routine that automatically turns on/off the cameras.  Even with these three issues, the quality of the camera, the ease of setup and app usability lead me to award five stars.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2020"

I had it facing outside in my bedroom window Towards my garage and it showed the picture clear as day. The only thing is it’s not continuous recording it’s 30sec so you have to keep hitting continue. And it’s only motion detection so if no one is moving in the room and it’s armed it won’t save the recording but if there is motion it will save it.

I immediately got a notification on my phone. Had the footage recorded and called him out on it to which he said he thought he heard a noise coming from my room so he had to check it out. I have now purchased a new door handle with a lock and key to lock every time I leave my room verses just locking over night. I’d give this mini camera a 100000/10.

I had this camera a little over three months when the night vision just quit working.  I tried to reach out to support, but no response.  What's the point of buying a camera with night vision if the night vision doesn't work?!?!  Also, not being able to extend the clip length longer than 30 seconds and not being able to shorten the trigger time more is also pretty silly.  Losing ten seconds in between clips can be crucial during a robbery. Really wish I wouldn't have bought this or could return.

   I'm not gonna lie I bought this to check in on my kitties during the day and it didn't disappoint!! I got a motion notification yesterday and saw one kitty laying there and then heard some kind of crazy noise and watched my kitty run off. The noise became constant and loud and I couldn't figure out what in the world it was....so needless to say I left work to run home to see that my kitty had knocked over her water fountain and the noise was the motor running with no water since water was allll over my carpet!!

2616,Jennifer Gallagher,Complete waste of time.,  These cameras should not be on the market at all. I spent over 3 hours on support calls with blink and my internet provider and still couldn’t figure out the “easy setup” mini cameras. The issue is not fixable and i highly advise anyone looking for an easy setup camera to steer clear of these for sure. You’ll end up in a day long headache over a $65 purchase. Save your money and buy the ring cameras instead.

   I LOVE this product! The main reason I bought this product is so I could check on my dog throughout the night when I’m at work. It was affordable compared to some cameras I looked at and worked perfectly for what I needed it for. I shared what it’s like to view a photo or live video from the app, and picture/ video quality day/ night were pretty impressive. The ONLY complaint I would have is whenever you view a live video or take a picture of the room, the camera makes a clicking noise so if someone wanted to use it discretely it would defeat the purpose.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2020"

No sound comes from the camera speaker at all. That and you have to hit continue if you want to live view for longer than 30 seconds.  This it pointless for a plug in camera. So far kind of a miss.

3108,Amazon Customer,This makes you buy a subscription to record video on the app,"  The cameras work fine. The motion detection is entirely dependent on the cameras connection to the internet, so if they’ve got a semi poor connection to the internet they will not record anything.

3401,Reid Schuetz,Ok for the Price but not for Security,  This camera works okay but if you’re looking for something to actually help keep you safe this isn’t it. Picture quality and movement is subpar.. always skips or crashes. Don’t try to watch live view if you’re getting motion alerts because it will take 1000 years to load and by then whatever was happening is OVER.. motion works most of the time.. all in all if you need something to drop in on a pet or just for peace of mind then this would be decent for you.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2022"

4989,Randy,Great camera for the price,"  Great quality for a $30 camera. Way cheaper then ring cameras. Only thing I would complain about. Is the fact that you have to switch screens when wanted to view another camera. I would have liked it. If that empty black space underneath my living room cam, could have showed my outside cam all together. Other then that great quality and great audio for the price.
