0,Zichao Fu,Useful to take care of my pet dog,"  I bought the 360 because I need to check whether my dog behaves well while I’m away. So exciting to watch and talk with her, seems like I’m still with her. The image quality is superb and I can even zoom in closer on the image. My dog walks around in the house and jumps to the sofa sometimes. It did follow her movement automatically thanks to its motion tracking feature. I can see her all day long. Absolutely love this camera!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2019"
1,Zichao Fu,"The ONLY BABY MONITOR you NEED, Especially for the price! ❤️","  Ok let me just start out by saying OH MY GOODNESS is this camera amazing!! 360 degrees to keep a watchful eye on my babes! Also, remote access so that my sweet parents can also watch her when they can’t be around her (hence this quarantine)!The price!!!!! Well worth it and reasonable! The last monitor I had was over $100 and it died just short of its warranty and could not be sent back. Very very VERY pleased with this product.This product also is easy to mount! No weird angle that you need to attach to the wall then screw in the cams!! NOPE attach then click in the cam! Wonderful!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2020"
2,Shennanigans9,Great camera at a great price-point and simple to setup!,"  I have the Nooie 1080P indoor camera and I've been quite happy with it so I had to give this 360-degree model a try. It takes the features of the static camera and adds the ability to pan and tilt the camera either manually or you can enable motion tracking easily through the app. I wrote a review for the static camera and many of the features carry over including its great video quality so if you've read that review, some of this will seem familiar.Setup -Setup was very simple using your phone or tablet, running the free Nooie Cam app. You first need to verify that your phone is connected to the 2.4Ghz access point in your home where you will be using the camera. You then simply start the Nooie Cam app and select the +Camera button. You select the Nooie Cam 360 option and it will walk you through the remaining, simple steps. Basically, you assure the camera is on, enter the password for the wireless access point/router your phone is currently connected to (this is the same one you will be connecting the camera to), click Next, and a QR code appears on the screen of your phone. You now hold the screen of your phone in front of the Nooie camera's lens and it provides an audible tone and LED light indicator when it is finished reading the QR code. The app will now inform you that it is pairing and will begin a countdown. When complete, the app will inform you that pairing has completed. It's that simple.Use -Now that the camera has been added, you simply select it to view the camera. To hear audio from the camera, you select the speaker icon within the app and now you are able to see and hear what's going on around the camera. The camera also has a built-in speaker that allows you to press the microphone button within the app and then speak through it. This is very useful and/or just fun depending on where you locate the camera. For example, I have the camera in my living room where my cat typically spends a good part of her day. If you have cats, I'm guessing yours is similar where she doesn't have one place that she always lays within a room. She instead has multiple locations that she'll randomly select. With this 360 degree camera, either from home, from work, a restaurant, wherever I have WiFi or cellular access I can pan the camera from left to right and up or down. It's range is great where you can literally place the camera in the center of the room and, from the app, turn it from it's left side behind it all the way around front, through to the right side behind it just by swiping across the screen with the camera's image live the whole time. You can pan it around to see the entire room. Beyond this, you have the ability to tilt the camera up and down from the app as well by swiping up and down on the camera's image live. I can scan the room for my cat, locate her, and then touch the microphone to talk to her. Being a cat, she chooses whether she wants to respond or not. Sometimes her ears just perk up and she whines (which you can hear through the camera's built-in microphone), but other times she'll choose to walk over to the camera and give it some love. :)If you choose to use the Motion Tracking feature, if your cat, or anything really, moves in front of the camera's lens, the camera will follow it. As the moving option moves close to the edge of the camera's current visibility, the camera will move to center the moving object within it's vew and continue doing this until the moving object either stops moving or moves behind something where the camera can no longer see it. One thing to note with automatic Motion Tracking is the camera can pan 360 degrees. If something moves and the camera ends up pointing in a different direction than the next moving object. The next moving option must move in front of the lens at some point for the camera to see it and start tracking it. Depending on where you mount the camera and your use, this may be fine or it may not. So, definitely think about this before placing the camera if you plan to enable Motion Tracking.Video and audio can be recorded to either a microSD card or to the cloud. Cloud storage is a paid service. Given my usage, microSD recording is fine for me so I haven't tried the cloud storage option. MicroSD recordings are easily accessed through the app via a scrollable tape across the bottom of the screen. You select the day and then scroll through to the time you would like to view. If at any time you are viewing live video or recorded video from the app and you would like to save the video to your device, you simply press the camera icon on screen to set the start point, continue watching the video as it plays, and press the icon again when you'd like to stop and the video will be saved to your device. It's VERY easy!Like other security cameras, you can also setup notifications based on sound and/or motion. This too is easy to configure by selecting None, Low, Medium, or High for each option and then selecting the timeframe that you would like to receive notifications. Note that you can enable disable notifications by day, but each day only has one start time and one end time that can be selected. Meaning, you cannot setup notifications from 8am-5pm and then again 10pm to midnight for the same day. You could do one or the other, but not both. I don't see this as a problem for me, but it's worth noting depending on your use case.There are a few additional notable settings. First is the ability to enable/disable audio recording. I haven't done much testing with this, but I'd imagine this could save some space on your microSD card, allowing you to possibly record more video if disabled. Second is the ability to enable/disable the small LED light on the camera. If you placed the camera in a visible location in your home, you may want to disable the LED to avoid the distraction of it. Last, there is a Rotate Image option. So, if you need to mount the camera under an overhang, cabinet, etc., you can simple tap this button to flip the image for mounting the camera upside down and now viewing it live or recorded video will display right-side up.Customer Service -I reached out to Nooie's customer service prior to purchasing my previous camera as I had a number of questions. I received quick, thorough responses the same day, shortly after I had sent them. I worked with Julia who was great to work with. Very friendly, personable, and understanding. Julia's customer service was great and made the decision to purchase this camera a complete no-brainer. As I'm sure many of you know, when you have questions or something goes wrong you really find out what a company is made of. I'm happy to say Nooie's support is great! Regarding this camera, I had a few questions for Nooie support prior to purchasing it and received the same great, prompt responses. This proved even moreso that their support is great! It wasn't just a one time fluke with the first camera.Summary -This camera works great and has clear video. The two-way communication capability is an added bonus and could open up its use to more than just a security camera. It's ability to automatically track motion as well as it's ability to turn 360 degrees while automatically tracking motion and/or by manually swiping the screen coupled with it's low price point of under $40 makes this a great buy in my book! I am definitely glad that I added this camera to my home. It will work well keeping track of not only the cat, but I can see when my teenager comes and goes when I'm not home.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2019"

4,JDS,"Don’t get it, spend your money elsewhere.","  DO NOT BUYThe only good thing, when it works, the picture is great.Everything else is horrible. The way you set it up you can’t just type in your password, it generates a QR code and it tries to get the camera to read it to discern your password. The problem is that it reads it wrong half the time. It rookie me nearly 30 tries just to get it set up the first time.The setup is horrible. Idk who thought his up but it barely works at all. I could get to step 2 or 3 and it would say it had connected but then just timeout.For reference, I have google fiber, a nighthawk router, and I have multiple devices MUCH farther away from my router that NEVER have issues. This thing had trouble just CONNECTING. It’s terrible. Idk if it’s the network chip in it or what, but it’sGod awful.If any of your toddlers unplug it ever, when you plug it back in it doesn’t reconnect. You have to manually redo the entire setup process. Anytime you lose power, or it gets disconnected.It has a lag to viewing. It has to “load” every single time you try to view it.It’s about as UNINTUITIVE as it gets.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2019"

9,Melissa Councell,Being watched?,"  I know it sounds crazy, but I think my partner and I are being watched. We bought this product a couple months ago, and if you have purchased this product and set it up, you know that it makes a startup sound when it’s plugged in and first turns on.It’s been working fine until about a week ago it randomly made the start up sound, but the camera was already on. It’s been happening more and more lately, and the camera now starts to move in our direction even if my partner and I aren’t making any noise or moving. I’ve since unplugged it because I feel uneasy about it.Honestly, it’s a great camera otherwise. The price is great and we haven’t had any problems with the camera besides we feel like we could be being watched.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2021"
10,Yilin,Smart and powerful camera,  I like this camera very much. It looks simple but is smart and powerful. You can record high quality videos/photos through Nooie APP even under poor light conditions. You can also hear the sound from the camera and make your voice heard to the camera remotely. It can move at any direction and the angle can be controlled by simply tapping and dragging on your phone screen. Highly recommended.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2019"
11,Yilin,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING PRODUCT,"  At first I was a bit skeptic about the quality that this camera would have. I wasn't familiar with the brand Nooie, and with such an amazing deal on the purchase price, I just assumed that it was too good to be true. However, this camera has not only exceeded my original expectations, but it has also created a new standard on what I expect from any future camera or recording device purchase.The camera offers amazing video quality no matter which video resolution your using. The added night vision feature is just an amazing bonus to have, even more so with the clarity of the screen images. The downloadable app that goes along with the device works wonders, and has a nice amount of features to make your camera experience go above and beyond what most cameras will allow.The camera has video recording, still picture taking availability, voice activation, motion detection, motion activation, two way communication, cloud storage, sd card storage, sharing capability, and a lot more features that will make you fall in love with the camera as well as the available app. I definitely give this camera and its available app a 10 out of 10! I love it so much, I'm going to purchase 4 more!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2020"
12,Connor Hua,Love this camera,"  PROS:Great priceQuality pictureEasy set upSelf-monitoringTwo-way audioLots of features in the appCONS:Limited to one range of time per day for monitoring.The manual does not specify which type of microSD cards is compatible.Your phone/monitoring device must be on same internet connection to set upI love this camera. It was easy to set up and use. I already have a Nooie 720P so adding this camera to the app was easy. If this is your first Nooie, you will need to download the app and create an account before using the camera. Once installed, you use the camera to scan a qr code that will appear on your app.  If you already have a Nooie, you can add this camera to the app by pressing the + sign for adding cameras in the app.The quality of the picture is good and the ""follow"" technology worked perfectly. When I first connected it, there was about a 15 second lag between the camera and viewing on my app. I suspect that was an internet-related issue because that disappeared quickly.I forgot to order a microSD card with the camera. If you want to be totally self-monitored, you will need a compatible microSD, The manual does not specify which type of microSD cards is compatible. The first one I ordered for my 720P did not work but the SanDisk card I ordered after reading comments here on Amazon, worked great. Other than this, the manual is simple and succinct, easy to follow.If you are watching live and want to take a still picture or video of what the camera is seeing real-time, there is an option in the app to do so. There is also a monthly monitoring service available for purchase at a reasonable cost through a company Nooie partners with.The camera arrives well packaged with recyclable cardboard material. Once removing the camera, there is a lower compartment that has the power connector and cable as well as hardware to mount on a ceiling or wall. The camera stands on its own when using on a table or shelf.Your phone/monitoring device must be on same internet connection to set up. Once set up, you can monitor from anywhere you have Internet.  That is not an issue for most, but I could not set it up in my office. Our WiFi system treats each login as a unique private network for security reasons. There is no way to plug into the camera for direct setup (an option many printers have, for example) so I am unable to use it in my office.For most, this is a VERY affordable, quality product that will meet your needs. I find myself favoring this camera over my SimpliSafe.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2019"
13,Connor Hua,Do not buy.,"  I bought this in early June to give to my son who has a diabetic cat.  As he was moving out of our home into his own apartment where the cat would be home alone all day. This would give him peace of mind to be able to look in on Poe. But it has yet to work. Amazon had nothing but great reviews but my son found the Google reviews were saying something different. According to these reviews this item worked well until an update to the app was done in January.  At that time, everyone said the app stopped working and they were hoping a new update would solve the problem. Well here we are in July and still not working. My son said in June he would wait for the update. For me, just a waste of money. Should have spent a little more and got something better. But I trusted the Amazon reviews.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2019"

15,Gabriel,Cat cam!,"  On a whim, I decided to purchase an indoor camera to see what my cats got up to when I was sleeping or away. I learned they're actually pretty boring. haha! The camera was super easy to set up. Download the app, scan the code and voila! I installed a 128 micro SD card, but I also opted for the 3 day cloud service as a sort of backup. Plus, I like that the cloud catches incidents and I can move to each one. The videos are good quality and it's fun to capture videos and photos from the footage to share.In fact, I was so happy with the Cat Cam 1, I purchased a second one: Cat Cam 2 for another area of the house.I do have one teensy complaint or wish about the cameras. I wish that when you scroll through the saved videos, you could see what you're scrolling through, like when you grab the bar on YT to move it, the pictures you're moving through show. If that makes sense. On the Nooie 360, if you grab the bar to move it, it just skips to that place. Having the incidents notices on the cloud sort of works around that, but still. I also wish there was a way to see the live feed and/or have access to the cloud saves on the computer. I've tried different things, but can only see them on the app. If I want to view on the computer, I have to record the bit of footage I want to my phone, then send it through dropbox or email.Overall, great cameras. My family and I are having fun with them. We like to talk through the phone app to troll each other. You can also pan the camera all the way around from the live view in the app to check the room.  Just a great little camera set up to have fun with and also have an added bit of security.Photo1 - Hitting the picture/still capture off the video in app.Photo2 - Night vision works really well!Photo3 - This is a screen cap of the whole app as you would see it in use viewing the cloud captured footage.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2020"
16,Gabriel,Horrible app makes this otherwise good camera useless,"  I got suckered in by the many 5 star reviews and after receiving the camera (which technically works, it's the app that's horrible and renders the camera useless) I understand now that these reviews were left as a bribe for free stuff. Included in the package is a note stating if you leave a review you get a free SD card so their high rating is essentially bought.I will be returning this camera as the app is so horrible it's impossible to use. It freezes constantly (search these reviews for the word freeze) which defeats the whole purpose. When the app is functioning it provides a clear picture. But as soon as I try to zoom in or pan around, the picture freezes and I'm unable to control the camera or see what's happening anymore. I have no choice but to force quit the app and start over. It's really too bad because the picture and viewing angle are superb. They really need to update their app so that it's functional.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2019"
17,ARetiredArmyVet,DO NOT use as a baby monitor! Worst camera ever.,"  I got this camera a month ago because of its positive reviews and price. After one month of using it, I should have invested in a more reliable brand that I know would work properly. We used it as a baby monitor for our newborn but the image kept freezing countless times (which ruins the whole purpose of MONITORING your baby!. so DANGEROUS! . Countless times I thought my baby was fine and then I realize I was looking at a frozen image for hours. Once again, very dangerous!. My baby could have had a real problem and wouldn't have known until it was too late). Oh and BTW, I even installed a wifi repeater right next to the camera to make sure it wasn't freezing because of a week wifi signal, but the image freezing despite having a super fast 130Mbps wifi signal right next to it.

You have to get on a 2g network, get it to read a QR code (sometimes you’d have to try 5-10 times, each time it takes 30 seconds). Then if it did read the QR code you would then have to wait and pray for it to pair (when it did work, sometimes you’d have to try that step another 5-10 times.) the camera also needs to be re-paired everytime power is out or WiFi is out. So all in all a huge waste of time. Ultimately of course the last time I tried to pair it, it refused to after countless tries. So now it’s completely useless.

21,SouthernAgain,"Be wary of Nooie and its minimalistic packaging: It truly is minimalistic, even in its features!!","  Pros: appearance, decent 1080p quality (as seen on photo)Cons: dysfunctional 2-way audio/voice capacity (you can make out 2 seconds worth of speech through receiving audio but it is impossible to send intelligible messages due to choppy and disconnected interference), extremely slow movement of camera (you literally have to swipe multiple times—super labored— to get the camera to move 1cm every 3 swipes).We really wanted to love this set and purchased 4 cams to monitor our pet throughout the day. If you have a pet turtle or a pet snail, or even a sleeping baby, it might work. But this is definitely not for dogs and moving babies because the camera will not move fast enough even though it claims 360° coverage. If you don’t want to hear your pet/baby bark or cry, then this may just work because you can still hear them, but just not long enough since the audio is limited to 2-3 seconds at a time. If you ever want to talk to anyone through the camera, it’s better to forget the feature altogether. Our house is on 660mbps internet which is pretty fast and should not be the reason to such poor 2-way communication. For its beautiful minimalistic appearance, I wished so badly to keep all 4 units. I even purchased the Nooie doorbell cam and the power strip but now am having second thoughts of following through with this company... There are other brands out there that will be way more reliable for your purposes of monitoring your loved ones than Nooie.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 10, 2021"

We use ours to keep an eye on the kids' pet rabbit. set up was a breeze and I didn't even realize it had night vision until it automatically switched when the light got too low.My only complaint would be that the camera is slow to respond when you try to move it via the app BUT that's a feature we rarely use anyway because I set up the camera in a way that I can see the whole bunny enclosure without moving. Good thing, too, because she HATES when it moves. So heads up, your pet might see it turning and FREAK OUT. She's used to it by now but she still doesn't really trust that it's not going to eat her.

25,jennbee,Only ONE viewer allowed at a time greatly reduces the value of an otherwise VERY superior product.,"  If you have more than one person in your family who will actively be wanting to keep an eye on things, too bad. Since this is portrayed as a ""baby monitor"", let's imagine a strange, odd, almost unheard of scenario... One involving TWO people!  A mom.... and.....? A Dad!!!!  Whoa.... [Mind. Blown.]  I know, crazy right... Let me add to the Twilight Zone-esque atmosphere a little bit here... Let's imagine that BOTH of those humans want to keep an eye on baby at the same time. Too bad!  It's not going to happen!  If mom is at work and she wants to log in to the app so she can observe the baby from her office while dad has his mobile device with him in the kitchen as he prepares lunch for the other children in the family, HE will be kicked out of the app once mom logs in. Or conversely, if mom was logged in first, SHE will be kicked out when dad logs in.  As you see from the other stars given to the product, the picture quality is great 1080! The motion detection works very well and even is capable of automatically following movement! The IR night vision is quite clear. not full color, but it is IR, and as I said, it is VERY crisp and clear.  Those are all VERY VERY great features and attributes for this device.  But for me and MY needs / uses of the device, more than one person should be able to log in to view.  I can appreciate that, perhaps this is a security measure, albeit NOT a very good one, since it does NOT deter unwanted login, it merely kicks out the current user to allow the next person logging in access to view.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2021"

27,Katelyn Hartje,A Must Have for your Pet!,"  The Nooie camera is awesome. Its picture quality is very clear and the included features such as 360 degrees view, night vision, and motion detection make it an excellent all-around baby or pet monitor. Additionally, you can speak through the microphone to get your subject's attention. The slight delay in audio pickup is only noticeable if you are using the 2-way audio in the same room as the camera. In our case, this camera has helped tremendously in training our new puppy. Since he likes to eat everything in sight, it's great to be able to check in on him as well as be alerted when he barks or makes any sudden movements. As far as design goes, the camera looks very modern and its simplicity makes it easy to pair with any style, not to mention the Nooie camera recently won Gold in Home Interior Products/Electronic Device Accessory & Platinum in Media and Home Electronics/Consumer electronics and cameras from the European Product Design Award™.All in all, a great investment for anyone with a baby or pet, and at less than $50, it's a bargain. Highly recommend!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2020"
28,Vin,"3 star product, 5 star company","  Update:After posting my review, Nooie reached out to me and offered to either refund my money or send me an updated outdoor camera to try out. I opted for the outdoor camera. They did not want the indoor camera back, and truly seem to just want to make me happy and offset my losses with the previous camera. I look forward to trying the new camera. I have to say, I am very impressed with the company. I will be upgrading my review to a 4 star. The camera is still 3 star, but the company is 5, so 4 is a fair rating.A little background:  My 5 year old son is afraid of monsters. He is REALLY afraid of monsters. He is so afraid that he doesn’t ever play in his room. He has to be able to hear me and know that I can see him. I bought this to give him some peace of mind and give myself some peace (period).We put the camera in his room, connected it to the WiFi, and I got the app.At first, we both loved it. But unfortunately, that didn’t last long.For starters, the picture quality is great. That’s the only feature I have been fully satisfied with.My biggest complaint is the lag. Often times, he would say something to me, and I would respond, but my response was so laggy that, by the time it reached him, he had gotten scared that I could not hear him and ran out of his room to find me.It freezes CONSTANTLY.The field of view is not great. We had it on his dresser, and when he was sitting on the floor, I couldn’t see him. This could be remedied by mounting the camera, but the camera has to be plugged in to work, and the cord is not long enough to reach the outlet from a mounted position.The motion sensor works well in terms of detecting motion, but the motion tracking was lacking. The horizontal tracking seems to work well, but I don’t think it works vertically.We did not try the night vision because, camera and intercom or not, there’s absolutely zero chance he’s going in a dark room alone.Finally, we abandoned the camera idea for now, until I can buy a better quality product.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2020"
29,Vin,I do not recommend!,"  Ok. First I am not the kind of person usually putting bad reviews. I truly think that each one deserve a good feedback for the work they are putting into their products. But this one really deserves no stars.I will try to explain why.First everything is considered the price of the camera. I would probably not react this way if it was a 20 bucks camera. For once that I invest the price....i am pretty upset.The camera seems to be solid.The pairing system to the network works but could be improved. I am an IT engineer and I can tell that I needed 3 attempts for the pairing.You have to create an account to even use your camera.Ok now starting all the true desappointements:- when you switch the network then you loose all the sharing you did with other people (let's say one for you and one with your wife...), Very annoying.- they way that you can not share with someone to an other county, it is not said before you buy it or anywhere in the description. That is bad, knowing that if you ask to the other person to put US instead of the real country of residence, it works. So it makes no sense.-finally you can share with max 3 persons!!!???!!!!!! You (master account), your wife or husband, then only 2 other persons!! Why this limitation??!! Make no sense!Finally if the bandwidth is not big enough on the network, the camera will freeze and never allow to reconnect except after a reboot.The design is nice, field of view is ok....but for this price I expected way better on the app side. My 30 bucks Chinese camera is more flexible!",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2021"
30,S,DONNOT buy for baby camera. App has a long delay.,  You pay for what you get. Camera is cute and sleek. Mounting it to the wall is ok but not to see a whole room the cord isn’t long enough. The night vision is works well. The motion and sound detection has 3 settings( we live close to an airport so that worked well for us) unfortunately if your using this for your baby DONT! It has a 2-4 second delay. The app never opens in a timely manner so your better off getting up and checking on them instead of using the camera. It updates and says it’s improved but it just seems to take longer and longer. There’s times the app doesn’t even open. Installing was not that difficult but the app and camera took some time to respond to each other. It also kept shutting down before it was synched to each other and we had to do it all over like four times. Over all I wish we had spend more money on something worth the trouble. Would definitely not recommend to anyone.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 9, 2020"
31,The Hams,Great picture quality,"  I was very pleased with the quality of the video on my phone.  Setup was easy to follow and except for needing firmware update all was fast.  I was also able to access from my phone on 5 Ghz network, although camera is a 2.4 Ghz product. So far very pleased.  Setup  required  phone  on 2.4ghz  network.

32,The Hams,"Great camera, terrible software","  TL;DR :A) Video quality is actually really good, but the setup is extremely flawedB) The audio is horrible - you'll need to buy a separate audio monitorC) The software is barely usable (see below) - this was a much bigger deal than I realizedD) The integration with alexa is not easy and the video is delayedI've been trying to use this software for about a month and here's what that process looks like for me:Step 1: Open Nooie Software on my phone and realize they logged me out (no face recognition option)Step 2: Find super secure password to copy and paste into appStep 3: Open baby camera - wait for video to loadStep 4: Realize it isn't loading, force quit appStep 5: Open app again, enter password again - video now worksStep 6: Continue monitoring baby for about 30 - 45 minutes until video feed stalls indefinitely(note: there is no notification that video feed has stalled. If you're not paying attention, it isn't obvious!!)Step 7: Repeat from Step 1I've tried using the integration with Echo Show, but the video quality is degraded and very delayed. Plus, the Show is not mobile and it's very difficult to go about my day while checking on a low-quality monitor in another room. I definitely rely on the phone app much more, but the app is simply not developed to the point where it is easy to use (see above).",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2021"
33,C. Heck,"Not too shabby, but it could be way better.","  Ok, so just got our Nooie 360. Got it on sale for 38$. For 38$, it's great. Pairing went just fine. Using 2.4GHz network. In fact, pairing went fine with 3 different devices connected to the same network. Also, unplugging Nooie and moving it around the house, also went pretty easy. So far, so good. Picture quality is so-so, more meh than ok, especialy in low light, but that goes for any camera (more or less). Controlling the camera via the app is slow and sluggish. Nothing to brag about, in other words.Now, the biggest problem this device has is its limited installation options. Sure, you can set it on a desk. Sure, you can mount it to the wall, with the lens facing down at a 90 degree angle. Sure, you could mount it on ceiling, but here's where troubles arise when it come to this device. Lens has a limited vertical movement span, meaning if you mount it to the ceiling, you won't be able to point the lens straight down, but rather at an angle. In our case, bassinet is in the middle of the room, so no matter where we place Nooie 360, we just can't get a good view of the bassinet. This could be remedied if Nooie offered a custom mount, maybe even one with a rotating/pivoting arm or something, but of course they don't. Which is as much of a bummer as it is a missed oportunity by the manufacturer. And I don't think Nooie's mount is standard one, again... bummer.  If manufacturer has any new mounting ideas, and if they work, we'll bump our rating. Thus far, 3/5. Recommended-ish.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2020"
34,C. Heck,The APP is the problem,"  At first this camera I liked, it gets the job done it lets me know when there’s noise the quality of the picture and video is good, BUT! When it comes to trying to connect to my other tablets such as iPad or Alexa tablets it looks so blurry so I don't recommend on big tablets. If your wifi sometimes struggle that’s an issue because it sometimes doesn’t tell you there’s poor internet connection and it remains frozen so it makes me think my baby is okay, and if your internet is not all that it sometimes a whole minute late of showing you what’s going on. There have been a few times where I had to check on my baby and leave the room it still shows that I’m in the room when in reality I’m not anymore so it would freak me out making me think there was someone else in there with her. But I’m not blaming the Nooie exactly on that my wifi does suck BUT! The one main thing I very much don’t like about this camera is the APP!!! It tends to log me out like perhaps 3 times a week! And it deletes the device so I have to redo everything all over again almost constantly !!! That’s what upsets me the most ! The APP is my biggest issue and it frustrates me all the time. I am now just going to get a camera that does not require an app and wifi.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2021"
35,Femalefeline Xoch,"Good video quality, but the app is glitchy","  The video quality in both the light and dark are great. The setup took a long time because the camera wouldn't sync with my phone and I had to look up instruction online. Eventually it did link, but the app is really glitchy. It signs me out at least once a week, which means when my baby is making a noise and I go to check the monitor, it asks me for my login credentials. It also disconnects or unlinks the camera from the app, so you have to go reset it and go through the whole setup again in the middle of the night. Obviously, this defeats the purpose of having a monitor. The app is also very slow to load - I could often walk downstairs to her room faster than it takes for the app to load. Finally, when you attempt to use the voice feature, the app stops working completely and just loads continually. I have an iPhone 12 and the fastest high speed internet available in my area, so it is not a phone or wifi issue. I like the portability of having the feed on my phone, but I wish it was faster and would stop constantly logging me out.UPDATE: Nooie contacted me and refunded me because I wasn’t fully satisfied with the purchase. Very impressed with their customer service and they seemed to take the feedback on the app seriously!",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2021"
36,Wisco,Worked great for 6 months but now it quits working frequently!,"  I really like this camera — picture quality is good (not good enough to see baby breathing, if you’re paranoid like I am you’ll find yourself checking on them with your own eyes), the night vision is really good, the app works well, you can move the camera around on the app, I really liked it for the first six months! But now it keeps quitting — I’ll go to the app to check on the baby and it either says it’s not plugged in, not connected to WiFi, or just shows a black screen. At first I tried restarting the camera, restarting my router, removing the camera from the app and reconnecting it, and nothing worked. Then I sent a support message on the app and only then did it start working again, so they must be able to fix it remotely. Now when it stops working that is what I do and it usually starts working again within a business day. It’s happening more frequently lately so I’ve requested a refund as the camera is still under warranty.

37,Wisco,DO NOT need to buy Amazon Echo Show 5 to use camera,"  I primarily use this camera as a baby monitor and it has helped a lot! Reason why I'm giving it 4 stars is because it doesn't have an instruction manual. I learned (the hard way) that you do not need to purchase the Amazon Echo Show 5 and that you can have more than one phone to access the camera.I don't recommend for those of you to purchase the Amazon Echo Show 5 because the camera does not continuously stay on the monitor, especially if you want continuous monitoring at night. After about a couple of minutes, it will return to turn the home screen and you have to repeat the command again to show the camera. So if you want continuous monitoring, especially for babies or kids, I highly recommend to not purchase the Amazon Echo Show 5.You can have more than one phone access the camera by going to the main account that the camera is already calibrated to on the Nooie app, select the camera, and select the settings at the top right. There's an option for the main account to share it with other users who have a Nooie account. To share, have the other user download the Nooie app and create an account. Once that's done, just enter the email address of the other user and the other user will have to accept the invitation within the app. Once the invitation has been accepted, the camera should show on the home screen of the app. That's it!If you're worried that the camera won't stay on on your phone, especially at night, it does. Just make sure you're also charging your phone while the camera is on as it will drain your phone battery since your phone will stay on.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2020"
38,Amazon Customer,product didn’t work for us.,  Tried to set up the product and I had a very difficult time getting it to pair. After multiple failed attempts it finally connected. We then had an issue with the firmware update. It kept failing and the device never worked. I was in contact with the support team multiple times to try and resolve the issue. They asked me where the device was located in relation to the router and if there was a wall in between them. We planned to put this camera in our baby’s room which is 1 wall away from the router. The support team notified me that the distance from the router could be causing the issue. I will be returning this product. If the camera has to be in the same room as the router it really defeats the whole purpose.The support team was not helpful at all. One other issue with communication with the support team is when you email them they respond within the app. Each time they respond there is no way to reply to their message. You have to begin a whole new support ticket. Seems ridiculous to me.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2019"
39,Richard Sang,"Surprisingly great camera, app could use some tweaking","  I purchased this camera based on the reviews and features vs price - overall I'm VERY impressed with this camera. The night vision is surprisingly good, the regular daytime quality is very good to excellent, and the sound quality is pretty solid. The ability to pan/tilt/zoom is also great. Overall, I'm a big fan of this camera. Easy to set up, and so far it has worked reliably.There are a few negatives, but they don't greatly diminish the benefits:(1) The app could be more user friendly. You don't have the ability to open the app and go directly to your active camera, you have to select a camera to view even if you only have one. In addition, getting to the settings - specifically motion and sound detection - requires several steps before you can adjust them.(2) The motion detection is REALLY sensitive, even at its lowest level and with the detection zone limited. Moreover, it alerts CONSTANTLY if my daughter is moving around, even when I have the app open and I'm watching the feed. Sound detection is also pretty sensitive, but less annoyingly than the motion.(3) I haven't used the SD card feature, but if you want to use cloud storage, there's a monthly charge. It's not much, and I'm not deducting from the rating because most cameras charge for cloud storage.(4) The camera works well on my Google Home Hub. However, one feature I was expecting that isn't available is casting to Chromecast or another service like my Roku. I don't know if it's a problem with the app or with Chromecast, but I would LOVE to be able to cast this to the TV instead of to my Home Hub.Overall, I'd give this 4.25-4.5 stars. Highly recommended, and it would be damn near perfect if they'd revamp the app.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2021"
40,Amazon Customer,Buyer BEWARE!!!!,"  1. This ONLY works with 2.4ghz routers. If you have a mesh router that flips between 2.4 and 5, this will NOT work.2. Your wifi password can only contain English letters and numbers (so no special characters like - or &, etc), so unless you're prepared to change your wifi password, look elsewhere.I spent 3 hours trying to set up this camera and in the process had to reset my router, clear my browser's cookies and cache, change my wifi password (much to the, uh, delight of my teen who is trying to get homework done online), reset the camera no less than 20 times, restart my computer, restart my router, restart my phone, download and delete the app no less than 6 times, and much, MUCH more.

We have very fast WiFi and the camera is constantly disconnecting or the app will say it’s disconnected when the camera shows it’s not. The camera takes what feels like forever to turn on and connect sometimes and I cannot tell you how many times I have had to remove the camera from the app and reconnect it. There’s an update for the camera now and I can’t update it.. everytime I try the update fails and I’m left spending a good 30-45 mins trying to get the camera working again. I purchased this as a baby monitor and it’s just not worth it.

   I bought this camera to replace a Blink camera we have set up to watch over our dog that recently had surgery. I like the pan & tilt option as well as noise alerts. Motion detection is great and it follows the motion. Night vision and picture quality is comparable to our other cameras. My dislikes: the only way to look at recordings is either to add an SD card or subscribe to their cloud which is more than the current subscription we pay for. The integration with Alexa is not as easy to set up as other cameras and occasionally does not respond as expected but I think that's related to the skill. It DOES work well on both the Alexa Show 8 & 5. You can 'share' the camera with someone but they must make their own account under a different email address or it will sigma out the other user which is a little frustrating as others do not work that way if you have a joint email account for specific situations like this. The instructions could be more detailed but it's easy enough to figure out. The camera comes with a mount but we just have it sitting on a table and it works well this way.  Overall it's worth the money but get an SD card when making your purchase or plan on the subscription.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2021"
44,Judy,Wifi cams are okay,"  UPDATE: i made another account so i can share this camera with my phone so now i get notifications on my phone for movement while i have the app already open on my ipad. Which we are getting an echo show (original reason why i even bought this specific camera) & i feel better about it this way bc my main thing was if my child moved & i couldn’t see it right awake bc it had to load then there’s no point bc i could just check on him by walking over. This means i’ll prob just keep this camera 👍🏽For the price it’s pretty good but i think i’ll be switching to a camera that doesn’t require wifi. This is for my bby boys room.Just a couple of things about this camera1) setting up is SUCH a pain in the ass it took me about an hr to finally connect the camera to the app2) if you have a motion notification you’ll prob miss what the motion even was bc it takes time to load the video (Mostly why i want to switch to no wifi monitor )3) it does have the option to take pictures & record. i like that option it just saves it straight to your camera roll. Idk how long it can actually record for, so far i’ve only done 35 mins as that’s how long it took my bby to fall asleep.4) the quality is not all that but i guess that depends on your wifi...i have really good wifi so not sure why the quality still isn’t as great as i’d want. Night vision is def better in my opinion.5) motion detection can be a lil annoying just bc the camera tries to center the movement so it’s just constantly moving. For example my boy moves his legs the camera moves to look at his legs & now his face is not really showing.6) the hook that goes on the wall is pretty small so if you want to move the camera to another room temporarily your wall won’t look weird w a big random hook on it (i worried about this bc his name is above his crib & didn’t want the hook to ruin the look)7) sound quality is good, it has a couple seconds of lag but it figures8) two way talk is good SOMETIMES other times it sounds like complete trashAll in all...it’s really not a bad cam for the price but i will be switching it out for a cam that comes w a monitor",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2020"
45,Allan M,Camera picture good...App not so much.,"  I bought this camera to alert me at night if my elderly father gets up in the night.  He started falling after a recent stroke and it became necessary after a couple falls in the night to alert me if he's getting up.  It's also nice to be able to keep an eye on him as I do other things around the house.Setup for me was a snap and I had it up and running in about 5 minutes from the time I took it out of the box.  The camera picture is very good during the day and decent at night.  The night view is good but certainly is not as crisp as I would like it but 1080p can only do so good at night. The ability to move the camera around from the app is nice but it would be nice to be able to lock the camera in place via the app as to not move it accidentally.  I accidentally move it frequently when getting texts and other notifications while in the app.  Long story  short the camera itself does a pretty good job of doing what it's suppose to.  The cord is quite short so if your mounting high, have an outlet near or be prepared with an extension cord.Now the app.  Where do I start.  It's functional but how good depends on your needs.  I'll break down my issues each on it's own paragraph, app and camera.There is no supported option to view this on the web from PC.  There is however a work around.  Download BlueStacks to your PC which is an Android emulator.  Set it up with your Google account so you can download from the Play store.  Download the Nooie app and create a NEW account with a NEW email or other email you already have. It just shouldn't be the same as the original email you have the cameras registered to.  You can use the original email but you can only be logged in on 1 device at a time.  A new account keeps you logged in on all devices.  Follow the signup steps then invite yourself from the primary account.  I know it's a pain but it works.  iOS also has a emulator. I'm not familiar with those since I'm an Android user but it's an option for Apple users.The biggest problem for me is not all motion is detected and alerted.  I use the bathroom in the night and I enter the camera viewing area well inside the view area.  The camera does not send a motion alert when I walk through which takes about 5 seconds from the first sign of me on the camera.  This is on low and medium sensitivity but it should still detect an entire body moving.  I'm not a small person. Ultimately I don't need it too right now and it still detects and alerts to my father if he gets up or even rolls over in his sleep as he is mostly centered in the camera view. My needs will eventually change what I use these cameras for so that's a negative for me.I want it to record to SD card continuously until I stop the recording and it doesn't.  Everytime I open the app it stops recording.  I need to start recording again before leaving the app.  Sometimes I forget and it's really annoying.If I need to review past recordings it's a real pain.  It gives a timeline by date and you have to go into the date and scroll to  find what your looking for which can be a pain depending what your looking for.  If your looking for something and don't know the date it recorded... May god help you in your quest to find it.On a positive note if you get an alert you can view the alerts from WITHIN the app inbox and have it take you to what caused the alert.  This is ONLY if you were recording.  I suspect a lot of people don't know that from some of the bad reviews I read.  I found this when I had a moth flying by the camera setting off motion alerts (even on low sensitivity).  It had to fly right in front of the lense to set it off.  Flying 3 feet in front of it didn't at low sensitivity.  If you have alerts by sound detection then this will be more difficult for reasons mentioned below...unless the reason is a loud one.The ability to share the camera view with others is a really nice feature.  My father is getting home hospice care and it's nice to have family be able to give themselves piece of mind by checking in on him... especially the one that lives out of state and can't be here.  The company states they can't adjust the camera but they definitely can move it.  This is a big problem for me. They cannot adjust the settings but I have had to fix the view from them accidentally moving it many  times.  This would be another reason to be able to lock the position of the camera from within my app as the owner.  It would also be nice for them to be able to control their own alerts with their app.  Right now they are stuck with how I (as the owner) have it setup for me.The 2 way audio is lacking for me.  A family member was standing  5 feet in front of the camera and couldn't hear what I was saying to them, only that I was saying something.  I don't talk softly so the built in speaker is a negative for me.  The microphone is lacking as well but is more functional than the speaker.  Room noise from anything more than 5 feet is not great.  I was talking to a nurse 4 feet in front of the camera and my family watching could hear good but hearing the TV at 12ft is VERY faint, tinny and not distinguishable, even at a decent volume.  Take that for what it's worth for your situation.A missing feature that would be nice is being able to set a motion detection area for alerting.  I was hoping this app would  do that (not stated it does) but it doesn't.I'll update as I think of other things, these were just off the top of my head.  I just ordered another camera for another room even with my issues as now is not the time to reshop for a new brand of camera I would be happier with.  The camera serves its primary purpose but it could do so much better with work to the app.  I'll update for a 2 camera setup if needed but for now I would not recommend this camera.UPDATE2 camera setup has all the goods and bad mentioned for both cameras.  I moved the primary camera watching my father to 5ft away from where he sleeps instead of 12ft away and false/no alerts are much better.  So apparently alerts are only reliable within 5 or 6 feet of the motion.I upgraded to the latest beta software to try and make things better and now I have connection problems.  Sometimes it's slow to load video and sometimes it doesn't load at all.  If your having connection problems then unsubscribe from being a beta tester in Google play and reimstall to see if it helps.UPDATE 2Ok I'm done.  1 of the cameras now disconnect randomly and needs to be unplugged and plugged back in to reset it to get it to work again.  I wasn't wanting to find new cameras now but Nooie is just not cutting it so I will upgrade to a 2k camera from another company to provide the night details I would prefer and also get a more reliable camera..  The negatives are now drowning out the positives.  Reducing to 2 stars.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 20, 2020"
46,Reid,Where's the technical support?,"  **2nd Update** Still no response from any technical support, and now, not only are the push notifications not working, but they also stopped being recorded in the inbox of events.  I am passed my window to return this product, so as of right now only half of it's features are properly working.  **Update** I all of a sudden stopped receiving banner notifications on my phone for the motion detection.  I checked all my settings and everything was good.  Checked for an update and they had just pushed one out so I am assuming it had something to do with the update.....HOWEVER, I am unable to reach any type of technical support. On the app, there's a way to message and report the problem via the app, and they are supposed to email me back, but they have not, after 4 messages.  There is no phone # to contact either.  I have received some marketing emails from them, all containing mispelled words.  I had previously received some technical help emails from them, they are definitely not US bound and have trouble communicating. See photos I’ve attached.  I had just ordered 2 outdoor cameras, they are going back.  I need a person to talk to or someone to respond back to emails from the company if  needing technical support. **  Amazed at the quality and functionality of this camera for the price! I don’t use this for a baby, I use it for my home. I can zoom in and out, rotate, look around the house, I’ve propped it in a window sill and been able to keep surveillance on the front of the house also. It has quality motion detection and playback. I can also talk 2 way through it. It has motion tracking and sound detection. We are going to buy one of their outdoor cameras next.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2019"
47,Schtrooklee,Great picture - terrible functionality,"  There is only one pro to this camera - it has a really good picture, both regular and night vision.  Regrettably, the software functionality is completely abysmal.  1) You can't view specific recorded events, at least not with reviewing the entire days worth of recordings. 2) You can't view the camera from any other device other than your phone with the app on it. 3) You can share the camera with your spouse, but they have to set up the app and a completely separate account on a separate phone. The list of failures go on and on.  It gets 2 stars for the great picture - but despite that, you should avoid this camera completely.  The good picture doesn't make up for the failures which make this camera useless for any purpose.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2019"
48,SolidandFirm,Frustrating product with a terrible app,  Had a very frustrating experience with this product.Like many similar cameras it needs an app to interface. The app is rated a generous 2.3 / 5 in the app store. A lot of 1 star reviews with a few 5s thrown in between which I assume are from the developers of the app themselves.The app pairing with the camera was a very painful experience and after everything it wouldn't stay connected.Even something as simple as resetting the camera was a very unpredictable process.I'm truly shocked at all these positive reviews. Did I get a product from a defective batch?Also why is there such a discrepancy between the app ratings and the Amazon ratings for the product when they are pretty much inseparable?All in all this one is going back as soon as UPS opens up. A very big thumbs down from me.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2021"
49,Kati Fitzgerald,I liked it so much I got a second,"  Pros: Almost everything about this camera is perfect- it has excellent picture clarity, a really decent app, it's affordable, and it picks up on motion and sound perfectly. I asked for this camera for my new baby (my last VTech baby monitor was over $100 USD and didn't even last 2 years before it started to short circuit) and I liked it so much I got a second for our living room and when we travel. I love how easy it was to set up and it has a fantastic roughly 350 degree view. Overall, I'm happy with these cameras and I use them daily. I also love you can buy an SD card instead of a monthly fee. The microphone is fantastic and I can use it as a mini intercom system with my husband when I need his help. The night vision is incredible and works better than anything I've ever seen. It auto turns to color in the daytime and it is crystal clear. You can pinch and zoom- and even manually turn the camera to look at things, which is great as well.Cons: so far, here are my concerns after using them daily for about 2 months: 1) the sound and volume on the app is almost totally non-existent. When my baby cries, I can't hear it barely at all when everything is turned all the way up and the sound icon is highlighted. I could whisper louder than the sound plays on my Google pixel phone- which can fill a full room with sound on the big speakers on the bottom. I entirely have to rely on the notifications saying a noise was detected because I can't hear anything. 2) I used one camera as a mini security while I was away for the weekend and it only lasted for about 12 hours before it stopped showing a screen. The camera occasionally needs to be unplugged and reset by hand (I've had to do it about 4 times in the 2 months so far)- and that happened while I was away making it totally ineffective as a home security camera. 3) when using this away from home, say while traveling in vacation, it's not easy to switch internet. You basically have to reinstall the camera each time (and pray they have a 2.4 internet speed connection because it can't connect to a 5 internet speed) which is a total pain... Because then you have to go home and reinstall it AGAIN.Overall: I really enjoy this camera a lot but there are some pretty annoying flaws that I wish would be fixed by the app developers. I will still recommend it because it's affordable and works decently well.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2021"
50,Brit,Cheap price OK product,"  We used this product for 2 and a half months but the important things to note is that this thing is SLOW. It takes a REALLY long time to buffer. At the time of writing, we are getting 4 FPS. Sure some times we get towards 30 FPS but the do not expect a smooth live stream of your baby. Why the 1 star? Today we noticed that our baby was screaming and we didn't get the notification on the APP that our baby was moving or screaming. Luckily we live in a pretty small house but it made us feel pretty bad because if we had the TV louder or had headphones in then we wouldn't have known our baby was up and screaming. Would not recommendEdit: we have noticed this product having more and more issues with not notifying us. Makes us wonder how many times we missed our baby crying.

51,A1ru1k0n9,Upside Down,"  Update: 1/5/21: This is my second one. It has worked well for several months and now I haven’t been able to get it to connect or sync for at least a month. I should have just returned it when it first gave me issues instead of exchanging it. I have reset it and unplugged it several times. I’m very frustrated.Update: I’ve had this for about a week. It is now in color. The feed is now the correct side up however there is still a delay with notifications.Update: I now get alerts when there is movement but there is definitely a delay.The video feed is still upside down while sitting on my shelf. I have tried clicking rotate image and that hasn’t helped.The picture stays in night vision during the day.Original:So I set it up correctly, I went back to check the feed and the video is upside down.Also, I’m not being notified when there is movement in the room.I will update review if this improves.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2021"
52,Melissa Williamson,Great when it works.,"  First off, when this thing is working well it's pretty damn good. Picture quality is great, night vision is great, and the ability move the camera is nice.I noticed some reviews said that having your phone as the monitor didn't work for them but we had a spare galaxy S9 so we used that as our dedicated monitor phone so I had no issues with using our own phone to see the baby.Our biggest complaint and the reason we no longer use this is because the app sucks. The camera and the app lose connection all the time, the app randomly crashes all the time (a problem if you're using it to monitor your baby at night when you're sleeping) and 75% of the time you have unplug and replug the camera in so the app and camera sync again. After waking up a few times because we hear our baby and notice the app crashed and didn't hear them from the phone was really frustrating.Price is great and it has nice features, it's just not reliable as a baby monitor.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 2, 2021"

54,Curly Gal,Update not so great! GREAT Baby cam/Puppy Cam/Security Cam - I'm using to monitor puppy,"  Updated review:Really disappointed in the camera now. I have not been able to use it at all because it just spins. Nooie is saying it's my wifi, but it's not. We have it on a 2.4ghz router and it is very unpredictable. We get an image, then it hangs up... spins, catches up, spins...it's unuseable!!  Makes me mad because I need this!! I really loved this camera but  the latest software updates made it no longer work  if they can't get this fixed it's going in the trash and I'll be out $50 :(.This is really a great camera system!  I bought this camera so I could hear if my puppy was crying in the other room when in her crate/playpen.  Works fantastic!  You can set it to notify on sound or motion detection or both and that feature works very very well.  I am able to talk to or correct the puppy with the 2-way voice as well.  You can control the camera from your cell phone and move it around too!  I also like that you can turn off the camera light indicator so that no one knows tha that camera is on and recording.  The puppy was seeing the light come on and that would gain her interest...also a GREAT feature if you use it for a security camera, which we will when the puppy is grown.  I bought a 128 sd card and that is plenty of storage.  You can purchase the cloud storage fro $5/mo but I don't see the need for that and perfer to not have my video stored in the cloud.  It's plugged in to an outlet and not battery op (HUGE plus)..  I have the BLINK system and use those cameras to monitor the animals in the barn (no electricity there), and had purchased an indoor camera to use to monitor indoors.  The Nooie is far superior to the blink camera...so much so that I will be purchasing more of these to monitor my home for security.  The picture quality is better, app software is better, electric and not battery,...Another GREAT feature is my husband and I can both be in the app monitoring the camera at the same time.  Easy to setup too.  All around great device that I'm very happy I purchased.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2019"
55,V. Fuchs,Good picture quality. Not great for seeing inside a crib due to lack of different mounting angles,"  The camera itself works pretty well. I like that it tracks motion and sends notifications for sounds and motion. Picture quality is pretty good too. We had some difficulty with set up at first but we got it figured out. For the most part it meets our needs. Our biggest problem we have with it is the fact that we are unable to mount it at an angle to see both the inside of the crib as well as the rest of the room. It’s not entirely 360 degrees in its movability. It does turn all the way around horizontally, but does not have a very wide range of motion vertically. Because of this, it is hard to look down inside of a crib when you have it sitting on a shelf or mounted on the ceiling. If you mount it on the wall where it sticks sideways, you can only see inside the crib and not the rest of the room. Having an angled mount would solve these problems, but they do not make one and it is not compatible with any of the universal mounts. Overall this was a huge disappointment for us. We had to do our own makeshift mount out of wood to mount it at an angle.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2020"
56,Lisa,Great little camera for remote check ins,"  I purchased this product to replace a baby monitor that frequently disconnects. I like that I can check on my child from anywhere, even if I’m not home. The picture quality is great, much better than the monitor I’m used to. Night vision is also really great! I like the motion following function although I hardly use it now, I anticipate using it when we switch to a toddler bed. It’s also great to be able to talk to my child if she’s having a hard time sleeping then I don’t always have to go in her room. A couple things that I might change: make it easier to switch the camera to a new WiFi. It takes forever to set up and  if you’re away visiting grandma you’re spending 10 minutes setting up the camera for a nap for 1 day. You should be able to save multiple wifi since some people even have more than 1 router in their house. The other thing I would change is the loud start up noise! It’s not a beep it’s like a nice like melody but it comes every time it is plugged in and could potentially wake a sleeping baby if power was lost and reconnected during the night. We haven’t had the problem but some might like to know that this is a possibility. But overall, a great value and I’m very happy with the purchase!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 24, 2020"
57,Stacey Waggoner,Do not buy this camera!,"  First off, this camera took over an hour of repeating steps to even get it set up because it wouldn’t work. We finally got it activated and it worked great, but would only let you access the camera from one device at a time. The app kept logging me out and I kept having to log back in daily, which now I assume was from it being logged into on another device (not my own).  One night I was in my daughters room laying her down for bed and a man’s voice started talking from the camera and the camera was facing right at us. I instantly unplugged it and took it out of her room. I feel so gross thinking about someone hacking into this camera that was in my girls’ room and watching them!!",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2021"
58,Stacey Waggoner,I love this camera,"  I could say so much about this thing! First of all, this is actually a really good monitoring camera for the price. I have it in my living room for a variety of reasons. Baby watching while cleaning since I have 3 floors, keep and eye on a 4 year old who likes to sneak into stuff, animals, and just security when gone.So before I get into the good, I have one bad. The app isn’t total trash but I wish moving the camera direction was a little bit easier. Other than that, I have no issues with the app either. I was able to share the camera device with my partner on his own account so we can both watch. But the method of turning your camera in any direction is annoying. You have to swipe up, down, left, or right on the video feed and it can be a bit of a hassle sometimes.Other than that one thing, I’ve had no issues with setup or anything! Pretty easy process. Simple app format (other than motion change). Night vision is actually pretty good and clear even when zooming in a bit. The clarity when it’s not using night vision is also surprisingly good for the price of this camera. I honestly wasn’t expecting that.So with it being a 360 motion camera, it has two extra options in the app. You can have motion sensor on and sound detection. The motion detection is pretty cool and I turn it on when I’m not home so keep an eye on my animals. It will alert you if it senses motion with a notification on your phone and also when you open the app to view the camera, it will follow the motion in the room. It’s not perfectly but it keeps up with my 4 year old so I’ll give it credit. The sound detection is actually pretty cool too. Again, it’s not perfect because it’s not an expensive camera but if you don’t have a tv on or loud background noise, it picks up baby crying and small noises like when my dogs were bumping into stuff and playing. Again, it will send alerts to your phone if in that mode. I have to turn sound detection off when I have the tv on though because I’ll get notifications like crazy.I guess that could be a con but it doesn’t bother me because I can turn it off and I would rather get all those notifications if I’m not home and be able to know when something is going on than not. But yeah, great camera for the price!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2021"
59,katt,Not a baby monitor,"  First and foremost this is NOT a baby monitor - I purchased this to keep an eye on my mother as she is elderly and her mind is wandering.  This will not work, for that or as a baby monitor.  I only purchased it because it came up in the search for a ""baby monitor""  It is in actuality, an indoor security camera similar to a ring but no where near as good.  Benefits that it is Alexa compatible and works on iPhone for away from home viewing.  I purchased this after the monitor I had was just too small of a viewing screen - screen size obviously is much bigger as it is both on my Alexa and my phone, but the night vision is very bad.  The nigh vision on Alexa is even worse (Alexa echo show 5) Two photos one from my phone and the other from Alexa - can not even zoom in clearly on the Alexa, zoom is much better on phone.  The other issue with this is the sound quality - it picks up loud noises but not much else.

60,Avaston,Worked well until they newest update - now it’s worthless,"  I had this cam for less then a year and we absolutely loved it! It worked well every time, was so easy to set up and the app gave us no issues whatsoever.Then about a month ago they came out with a new “update” that actually forced me to delete the original app and download the new one. The cam itself went through a software update as well when I first connected it with the new app. It worked fine the first 2-3 days and then suddenly it will NOT pair with any of my devices. It’s been about a week now and I’ve still been unsuccessful in getting it to work. After it reads the QR code it fails to go to a steady white light indicating it is ready to pair...At one point it did go to the pairing page... but then after 40mins of it saying it was pairing it gave me the ‘failed to pair’ notice.So this camera I once would’ve recommended to just about anyone who asked, is now absolutely worthless. I don’t know what the update was for but whatever it was it destroyed the cam. I’m shopping around for another one now....

The only times I’ve had issues with the camera is if my Wi-Fi was being  crazy(thanks Verizon). Other than that it’s been smooth sailing. I know others have complained about the night vision cutting out, but it’s as simple as sync the time with the app in your settings. I was really critical of the baby monitor I chose and ended up spending $200+ twice on monitors that just simply didn’t work. Like right out the box, nothing.

62,Junebug75757,The APP is its downfall (Update: turns out it was my phone!),"  The cameras themselves are great. Super easy to setup; the picture quality is great and so is the night vision! Love the two-way audio function. Now the bad part. When you are out and about, it is hit or miss if your phone will connect via the app.  Half the time, all you get is the pulsing Nooie N on screen waiting to connect (even though the individual cams show good wifi connection). When it does connect, the controls for movement are super large, and/ or drops. When it works it is awesome!  In good faith, however, I wouldn't recommend this system until they fix the issues with the app. Especially, if your buying this to keep an on a baby sitter, or any care giver that is working in your home taking care of your loved ones.Update 7-16-21: Changed from 3 to 4 ☆. Just got a new phone (Galaxy S21 Ultra), and the issue of the app not connecting has gone away. Looks like it was on my end with an older phone (Galaxy S9). To the company's credit, they did offer one of the following options to rectify the issue: full refund,  replacement camera(s) or outdoor cam. In all good conscious, I will not take them up on their generous offer. It was an issue on my end.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2021"

But he sleeps the best in his own room. As a mom, it's hard to be away when he could have an asthma attack.  This camera notifies me whenever there is movement and I can clearly hear his coughs, which is a precursor to his attacks. I can clearly see his face and the camera automatically follows any movement, in case he gets up from his bed.We both now sleep better knowing that I can see and hear him whenever he needs me.He even walks up to the camera (that sits on his dresser) and waits for me to come (no crying). It gives us both peace of mind.When I leave early for work, I can still monitor him and watch my husband get him dressed.The camera also has a microphone.  So I can tell my son to go back to bed, or tell my husband which socks to put on to match my son's outfit.We know that mom's run the home and this allows me to keep everyone safe and together.When we get a larger house, I plan to get a couple more.Two negatives,  it buffers sometimes and both me and my husband can't view the camera on separate devices.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2021"

I have twins so I bought two when they were younger so I could see them in their cribs and now I use one to oversee the room since they’re toddlers. The camera is fine and the app works as far as notifications about noise or movement but when you go to the app to see what they are up to, it NEVER works. It has worked maybe 20% of the time when I try to see what they’re up to in the last two years. I have a backup monitor without the video because unless you are in the app, you can’t hear what’s going on, only a notification letting you know noise was detected. It’s always offline/undetected. You can correct it yourself by going through the setup again but what’s the point for it to drop again in a couple of days. Especially since the setup is a pain seeing as though the camera can never actually scan the QR code the first few tries… I fell for the positive reviews but at this point, I believe they have to be paid.

65,Caitlin,"They watch over you, spy on you and record your babies and you with this camera !!!","  I will start by telling that we bought it for our couple's room, the one we share with our newborn.  Suddenly I began to see pictures of myself on my cell phone taken from my monitor, in the room with my baby.  Days later I noticed how the camera moved by itself. To focus, I entered the application to see what happened, but it was nothing, just me in the same place.  I mentioned this to my husband but he told me that he had movement so I let it pass (it should be clarified he was disabled).  Last week I had in my tray two photos of me in my underwear on my cell phone taken from the monitor, I thought that I had taken it from capture and again I let it pass.  Yesterday my mother-in-law took care of the baby at night and tells us in the morning that the camera moved completely from where she had it.  Today my husband and I were in the Bedolla and out of nowhere he began to move to focus.  To finish soon, my husband told me what was happening and I told him all the times that happened to me and I showed him the photos which were never screenshots.  (I never took the time to check whether or not they were captures, I just took it for granted but when reviewing that album) all the photos were taken from the monitor.

67,TyToshi,Excellent WiFi camera,"  This is a product that looks very polished, and its performance is very good (particularly considering its very reasonable price).  Besides the Nooie, we also have an 8-camera security surveillance system which is NOT HD quality, but pretty good SD.  When my wife first saw the video that the Nooie produced, she kept exclaiming how CLEAR the picture was! The other features that it has are also very impressive.Setup was a breeze.  The only issue I had was that I selected the 1080P option when setting up the camera in the app, when I should have selected the 360. Once I figured that out, the camera and app were ready to go in about 2 minutes.  So far the app has performed very well.  About the only suggestion I would have for the developer is to discontinue CONSTANTLY asking the user to upgrade the camera firmware.  I’m of the opinion that ”if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”, so I am not interested in taking on the risk of fouling up the operation of a device which so far works well.The motion tracking feature works pretty well. It even tracks my cat well.  Manual pan and tilt through the app is a bit laggy as some reviewers have reported, but it’s not terrible.  The motion of the pan and tilt is very smooth and very quiet. I’ve seen similar cameras in which the movement was pretty loud, particularly though the camera’s mic.I also like the loop recording to the SD card. I threw in a 32 GB card and used about 5.2 Gigs in 17 hours, so a little less than a third of a Gig per hour. That should give me a little over 4 days of recording before new data starts to overlay the older footage. Perhaps future versions of the app will have an option to only record footage to the card when motion is detected?All in all I am extremely satisfied with the Nooie 360, and definitely would recommend it to others!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2019"
68,LaFemme,"Great camera, but crap for monitoring.","  TL:DR- Great video quality, crappy notification system.The only redemption of this camera is the video quality, which is great, especially if you're just using it to check in on your kid playing by himself in another room. If you plan on using this for a night time monitor, I don't recommend it. You can technically leave the app constantly running, showing you the live feed, but unless you leave your phone on the charger and don't go into other apps, you don't get to have constant access to the camera. Instead of a constant live stream that you can leave on, like other monitors, you have to open the app whenever you get a notification about movement or sound and sometimes doesn't connect to the feed. It never notifies me when my 4yr old gets out of bed at 3am or is crying. But for some reason, will send multiple alerts 15min after leaving his room for story time that there was motion/sound detected. It will even alert me to movement when there's nobody home. I have done jumping jacks in front of the camera and still received no alerts. If it comes unplugged, you have to go through the WHOLE set up process again. Definitely wouldn't recommend this.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2022"
69,Diego,Pleasantly Surprised - Portable!,"  Purchased for baby monitoring but could be used for more. This camera is everything we’re missing in our bottom of the line home security system.There is significant delay with audio, and it would be nice to have a web portal to log in for a dedicated machine to give visual output, rather than having to keep opening the app on a mobile device to check in on baby. Picture quality is fine and it supports at least 1TB microSD, which is more than plenty of space for this reasonable quality video. Night vision is also surprisingly clear.Adding users leaves them with fewer permissions so it may not be idea if both/all parental partners are tech-inclined and like to tinker, but it’s actually a plus for giving others access–ensures they don’t mess up your settings. App has a sleek and highly usable user interface, especially compared to a lot of other similar devices on the market.Perhaps the best feature is that it takes micro USB power supply, so a $10 battery pack makes this usable all over the house. Disconnect/reconnect from power supply only takes about 10 seconds to resync with phone app. Pleasantly surprised at the versatility.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2021"
70,Kate J.,LOVE this camera!!! Works GREAT!,"  I have a Galaxy S10+ and a decent internet connection using an airport express for the wifi (generally, the wifi from your modem won't work as well) and this thing works GREAT for my setup. It moves towards the motion or sound and when you go to check the camera, what you need to see is already on screen! I haven't experienced any noticeable lag, it moves well and sounds great! I replaced a more expensive camera with this one as this one works flawlessly comparatively. The one I had before cost over $100 and had all sorts of features but they did not work well, and it was a battery hog when running in the background. I don't notice a difference with the Nooie cam. The night vision is spectacular! I checked in our sleeping newborn last night and was able to see her a momma sleeping away, clearly! I use this as a supplement to my dedicated baby monitor, plus I can check this when on the road or out and about. I love this and am SO happy I purchased it! I had no problems setting it up or using it. Just remember, this is a new camera using new techology with a HD connection. Everything will be affected if you have an old phone, a slow internet connection, poor wireless or a bad modem. This wouldn't be the fault of the device, it would be on the consumer to optimize their environment for HD wifi cameras; they aren't magic. With optimized everything, I have to say that I love this camera!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2019"
71,Misskittygirl,Pretty good camera and customer support seems ok,"  I wanted a way to watch my home without having to pay a storage provider and this camera is what I found.Pros:- Inexpensive and mostly easy to setup.- Movement tracking and recording is pretty good and can spot, track and record moving objects in the cameras view.- Uses local micro USB cards for video storage for when you have an incident and need video evidence.- Supports on-going software updates with minimal user intervention. (Could be good or bad.)- Clarity seems good. Have a look at the picture I included with this review. Probably won’t be able to read a license plate at distance.- Night vision uses powerful infrared (I think) lights to illuminate dark areas but won’t project out more than 20 feet but that’s good. They work in the dark.- Customer support is responsive, even months after a purchase but they seem to delay useful responses with information that doesn’t lead to a solution. (Like half answers. Maybe it’s a language barrier.)- Provides sound and visual movement detection and recording for events.Cons:- Setup can be tricky if you run multiple wireless access points at home and aren’t on the same network. (Won’t work)- My SD card was full of empty videos of nothing happening and seemed to trigger for no reason, leading to many useless videos and a full SD card. (I think they overwrite older videos but I need to verify that.)- Left to right motors may fail after a short period of time.- Nagware tries to get you to purchase their cloud storage in tricky ways like masquerading buttons for buying their service.- Cameras are often unresponsive, even when on the same wireless network locally and lag out.- Night vision won’t work through a window. No surprises, just the nature of reflective glass and IR lights.Was running a wireless packet capture to see if the camera was talking more than necessary to a remote server, possibly gathering information about my activities or exporting our videos to them but didn’t see anything unusual yet.I guarantee that if I uncover evidence that this camera spies on us and reports back to some station somewhere, I will post it here. I hate that.They do check for software updates, that’s common but I haven’t witnessed undue network activities to outside my local wireless network yet.Anyhow, these are a good solution for monitoring your home if you’re away or obtaining evidence around your home automatically through the motion and sound detecting.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2021"
72,Misskittygirl,Great video quality!,"  Updated May 2021: I changed changed me review from 3 stars to 5. I would do 4 1/2 if it let me. Like I said in my original review, the video is amazing quality! After some great customer service they sent me out a replacement camera and told me they updated their app and software to help fix the audio and connection issues. After testing it out for a few days I can say the Audio and connection has greatly improved. It is no longer choppy and works great. I would take half a star off if I could, due to the 2 way audio still being delayed and choppy but that is not a feature that I need for an inside camera. So it is not a big deal.For the price I would for sure recommend this camera! I am glad the audio and connection issues have been improved. This now would make a great baby monitor.Original ReviewThe camera has amazing quality and I love how it can tilt, rotate, and zoom, but sadly I had to return it. I wanted to use it as a baby monitor and the sound was horrible. It was choppy and would be useless for hearing a baby cry. The 2 way communication was also choppy. It also lost connection several times briefly while testing it out. To bad since the camera quality is so great. If your just needing it for video than it could make a great camera.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2021"
73,Tori,Better than the Owl,"  Honestly, I wasn't expecting much, I actually had another brand's camera set up before this one, but I kept running into some connectivity issues and then finally realized that it could not be set up with Alexa at all.Well, I finally had the chance to set this one up after realizing that this could be used with Alexa, and wow...for 1/3rd the price, it had way more features than the other hoot cam. I mean, yeah, it doesn't have a temperature readout, but honestly, I have enough temp sensors and other things that can read temps, so it's not a loss at all.But really, other than being able to use this with Alexa, the ability to record and/or take pictures is a HUGE plus. How is this feature not in every single camera at all? Also, you can add an SD card to record locally if you so desire versus your phone instead. It also has cloud storage (paid) if you want/need that.Do NOT hesitate, this is a great baby cam (or however you want to use it!)",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2021"
74,Stephanie Sperrazza,Sent it back.,"  Sent the unit back. What we wanted was a baby monitor and this doesn’t fit the use.  The only way to “monitor” you sleeping baby is to have the app open on your phone, draining your battery. You can have sound and motion detection turned on, but it comes as a notification to you phone or tablet.  What they don’t tell you is to get the advanced features, you have to pay a monthly subscription fee. We wound up buying just an old style audio monitor that also acts as an intercom. The units picture quality was fine, but controlling the movement of the camera is difficult and frustrating.  Nooie has a lot of room for improvement on this one.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2020"
75,Stephanie Sperrazza,"Worked for a little over two months on echo show, then just completely stopped.","  We have been using this camera for almost three months now, and other than the occasional lost connection that we'd have to restart, it worked fairly well. We had to do a reset of the camera, our phone and echo show connected to it a few weeks ago, but other than that issue we haven't really had much to complain about. Out of nowhere, two nights ago, the echo just lost complete connection to the camera and now says ""the camera isn't responding."" We use it as a baby monitor, so this was very unexpected and has changed how we can watch her.We have reset the camera three times so far, as well as completely disconnected it to Amazon altogether and restarted everything. Our internet was recently upgraded in the last month as well, but that didn't help the occasional connection loss. We reset the router too just in case. So far, nothing has worked. I reached out to customer service via email and as of right now they have just said to reset the camera which I've told them I have already done. I'm still able to use the camera on my phone, but we viewed it to check on her on the echos quite a bit so I am at a loss and hope they will help me resolve the issue or fix my camera. Will update my review if this gets resolved.4/7 - So far still happening, and the only response I've been left with was to show a video of the problem after they told me to reset the camera. I'm quite frustrated with this waste of $50.5/11 - This camera is a complete waste of money IF you are trying to use it with an Echo Show. I can use it on my phone but it gives us constant problems on the show. Spend a bit more on something reliable.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2021"
76,Lindsey,Frustratingly inconsistent,"  I was on the market for a baby monitor, and stumbled across this camera as a Lightning Deal. It seemed too good to pass up: a really good camera (with night vision!), motion tracking, and sound detection -- all at a really good price. I went ahead and ordered it, with the thought that I might eventually order a few more, possibly for the outside of my home.When it arrived, I was eager to tear into the box and get it set up. It requires a wireless connection, and I assumed it would be pretty easy to set up. (I was wrong.) You have to first download the Nooie app, and from there, you pair the camera to your wifi network. I have multiple devices across my home, and none gave me NEARLY as much trouble as this. You are given a QR code for the camera to scan, and from there, the camera searches for a wifi signal. I spent almost 45 minutes trying to get it set up. (I even set the camera beside the router, and it still didnt connect.) After consulting YouTube, and finally getting lucky, the camera connected with a loud, but pleasant chime. I opened the app, and saw the camera. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the video. I could pinch to zoom, control the direction of the camera from my phone, use the microphone to speak, connect to the cloud (or record locally with a SD Card), and I even had the option to set up motion alerts for when I was away. It checked every box for me.The next day, when I was away from home, I opened the app just to see what was going on, and the camera feed never loaded. I waited and waited, but the feed never loaded. I closed the app, tried it again, and much of the same. When I went home for lunch, I tried the camera again, and it worked perfectly - the camera opened right up, no issues. I went back to work that afternoon, tried to open the app again, and experienced the same things that I had that morning. I try the camera again the next day, and I have the same experience: the feed doesn't load. (On some of my tries, the app force closed, and others, the feed didn't load.) I try on the third day, and the camera finally works when I'm away from home. The next day, I come home to find the camera had disconnected fron the network. I reconnect, and have the same issues I hav before. (Mind you, none of the other devices connected to my wifi were having any problems.)As the days go by, the app becomes less responsive, I'm not getting motion alerts (or if I do, the camera won't load), and the camera still won't stay connected to the network for mode than a day. The app had been updated while all of this was going on, so I hesitate to blame it just on the app. So maybe the unit was defective? I don't really know, but I do know that I was let down by what I thought would be a really nice product.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 26, 2019"
77,Alycia Delima,"Not consistant, disconnects from internet, but great features","  There are definitely pros and cons to this camera. I want to love it so much, but there is one con that just seems to outweigh the pros.The major con? It does not stay connected to the internet consistently. I have had it not connected many many times in the last 2 weeks of owning it, and I couldn't hear or see my baby crying. I don't have issues with other devices staying connected to the internet, just this camera. Also, note that it doesnt connect to a 5Ghz connection. I knew that before I bought it, but double check your router/modem to ensure it is a 2.4Ghz connection , as most updated ones are 5.The pros on this carmera are great. It has awesome picture quality, as you can see in other reviews, including the night vision. You can adjust the position of the camera from your phone. It covers a large area for viewing, unlike most tiny baby monitors. You can adjust the motion and sound by low, med, high. So if you don't want it to pick up the car moving down the street, don't pick high. You can pick the times you want it to monitor for sound or motion. You can also turn them off all together. It was also easy to set up to my Amazon echo.I don't know if you can change how it notifies you, but the sound my phone makes wouls not wake me if I was sleeping hard. I wish it had the option of opening the camera automatically to active sounds and stayed open so I could hear the room instead of just relying on hearing the short ding sound and having to open the app to see what was going on. Sometimes it takes a while to pull up the active view, when I would like it more instant. happening.Overall this camera is mostly wonderful and has great features, but those features are worthless to me if I cant use them because it won't stay connected to the internet.Also, I bought a Wi-Fi detention for the baby room to see if that helped the camera stay connected and it did not!",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2020"
78,Keck Family,40 bucks is 40 bucks.,"  Quality is in line with price.Pros:- Mirco-USB so you won't have to chase around a replacement cord. In addition the cord that it comes with sits flush with base, a round housing keeps it secure. Very unique.- Simple initial set up.- Upon power loss, roughly 2-3 min to resync with wifi and your phone.- Phone app is handy, notifications for audio and visual triggers are accurate. Sensitivity levels are nice.Cons:-Night vision is very moody. Switches often.- Control of camera is a bit clunky, movement is slow and awkward.- Streaming quality can be hit or miss, (fast internet, close proximity to router, still skips and struggles at times.)- Microphone feature is basically useless. When you attempt to use it, it will drop your camera picture entirely- it is simply too much data for the device to handle, it cannot process the video and transfer the audio out. (This is very small for me, didn't even realize it had this option until I received it)Lastly, I can't call this a con, it is a bit weird though, they really push their cloud service on to you. You can still record and save from the app into your photos, but for constant recording, an SD card or their service is required. If you want constant surveillance, this probably isn't your product. If you just need to keep an eye on something and spot check it, it really is a good bang for your buck.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2021"
79,Keck Family,Updated review... back to 5 stars,"  ***Updated*** I did get a response,  I needed to update the app, and it works fine since then.  I think they weren't seeing my messages because I was using the older app (but never received any notice to update it). For what I paid for the camera,  plus 3$/month for 3 day recording,  it works very well.  Provided extra peace of mind on vacation, being able to keep an eye on my cats, and knowing the house was still there.It worked OK for almost a year, although I found out that ""works with Alexa"" does not mean it can be controlled with Alexa, which is misleading.  Customer service used to be very responsive despite being located overseas.  However I was recently forced to cancel my subscription in order to reset my camera.  Now  it took away the less expensive plan I was using,  but still won't even let me select any option at all. Customer service has stopped responding to messages in the app except with occasional excuses for not responding.  Overnight my camera shut off, logged me out of my account,  and wont let me log back in.

80,Tiffany,Works well,"  It does what it says. It’s pretty much like a ring camera. It’s awesome if you aren’t home and have a sitter watching your kid, you can check in on them, but if you’re home and just need to be away from baby but also need your phone or tablet or whatever device you’re using, it defeats the purpose and you may as well get an actual camera monitor that comes with its own monitor…Overall the picture and sound quality is great, it can notify you for sounds but I wouldn’t put it on if you have multiple kids because it’s sensitive and catches noise quite easily and your device will be notifying you all day…same with movement if you have kids in the same room. But it definitely detects both. The zoom feature is definitely a good feature to have. I’ve been able to catch moments of spit up and I caught baby rolling over for the first time. It’s a good camera to have, but if you’re looking to have consistent monitoring, this may not be the right one.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2021"
81,Brandon Ford,Nice baby camera,"  Works pretty well as a baby monitor- the app allows me to stay on it for continuous monitoring. The app stays open for the purpose of using it as a baby camera. I love the pan/tilt ability, and the motion detection works well.We use this as a baby camera since it can be repurposed later when baby is all grown up. Overall pleased with this purchase.Only wish there was an easy mounting option that let me use one of those universal mounts that attach to the crib. But it does have a wall mount plate and drywall anchors for you to drill into the wall/ceiling.4 month update:Removing one star because every now and then the camera changes to “daytime mode” in the middle of the night when the lightning hasn’t changed, and it causes the picture to go black so I can’t see my baby.

82,MacLeod,Updated Review,"  I initially got this camera and had issues hooking it up without a hotspot because I lived in a community residence where you had to login to their internet then use a secondary login for your apartment. This camera couldn't handle it so I returned it. Customer service was quick to respond and said they believe they fixed the issue (they did not) and had sent me a free camera.  I have since moved into a house with direct internet so I waited to update my review because I didn't know if my issues were related to the hot spot or not.The camera will run ok for a few days then crap out - that's happened since the beginning.  It basically disconnects from the internet so you have to reset it often.  I used the app to watch as well as move the camera.  Some times it was super responsive but a lot of the times it was not.  The camera wouldn't move, it'd get stuck.  The app constantly was loading and spinning so you couldn't see the image.  So I'm not sure if the issue was the camera itself or the app.  I recently decided to pay for cloud back up and paid 1 month.  I got charged an extra fee from my bank because this is an International company. I've now had this camera for 5 or 6 months and the thing no longer moves no matter what I do.  I have had enough, unplugged it and purchased a product from a different maker.  I canceled the back up to save myself the extra fees.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2021"
83,Kyta White,Wanted to love it,  I guess saying it was “Alexa enabled” was misleading or I didn’t read enough. Unless you have an Alexa tv or echo show you can’t enable it. It doesn’t give you notifications like our ring doorbell does so if I don’t have my phone on me I don’t know it’s going off. On the app it turns on by itself after I’ve shut it off. The notifications stopped all together at one point and I was told to reboot the whole thing and now the sound notifications don’t work. I tried to subscribe to view clips and it tells me to select a plan after I already selected one. Tonight my 3 month old was turned around from how I put him in the crib and I can’t even view how he did it.

84,Steph,So far worth the money!,"  Update: Reduced rating from 5 stars to 3. We purchased this just about a year ago now, almost on the dot, and the movement of the camera up/down has stopped working fully. It will not rotate down past a certain point anymore without having to physically move it. Very disappointed that it didn’t even make it to a year without an issue. Has been great otherwise! We’ll likely continue to use it while we can, and hope we can get some more life out of it before having to replace it.Original review: This camera works great so far, and we've had no issues! I read some reviews that said setup was difficult, and we did have to try twice to get it to read the QR code for our password correctly, but it seemed to be a matter of just holding it steady at the right distance of 8-10"" (I held it too close the first time, I think), and making sure you click on the ""full screen"" so it puts the QR code against a plain white background. Otherwise, the picture has been great, the night vision is way better than cheaper camera's we've had in the past, and I love the fact that you can adjust the camera position & view by moving it with your finger right on the screen of the app. We don't use the motion or noise detection on it, so I can't comment on that, but talking through it via the app worked just fine and in general if we turn on the noise to hear what's going on in the room it comes through clear. If we come across any issues, I'll update the review!",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2020"

I set up the sound detection and motion detection and set the motion area to just around her in bed. It worked wonders! The camera would ping me on the phone and I could run into the room and catch her before she climbed out. It was such a stressful time, but knowing I could be alerted was a major help!I was really nervous because of the price of this camera compared to other more expensive ones, i was also super nervous about the bad review the app seemed to have as well.

Check the App Store first, look at the reviews from there for the camera and you’ll learn all you need to know.My issues: Only one person can look at it at a time, unless you create multiple accounts and share the camera. So if you’re using this as a baby monitor to share with your spouse, it’s a pain in the butt to do. You can’t both log in to view, it will force a logout for the other person. Also, this camera HAS to be mounted upside down in order to get any good vantage point on a crib. The scope of the camera down is total garbage.

   It probably works fine if you are casually watching pets, but if you are looking to use for a baby monitor or ceiling mount look elsewhere. The claimant wireless in the title, apparently what that means is it’s Wi-Fi enabled. To make matters worse they do not give you a long enough cord to mount from the ceiling to plug into the wall. The cord is a USB!! and only about 4 feet long. On what planet does this make sense? So now I have a ceiling mounted baby cam that I need to use my own USB to outlet plug, and then attach a new extension cord to it?!?when the app actually works it’s fine, but over half of the time it takes 4 to 5 tries to actually get it to connect to the camera.

I have had to disconnect and reinstall it multiple times to get it to work, and even then it doesn't want to.  I will say the motion detector works great, but unfortunately when I get the alert that the motion sensor was activated, I cannot see what tripped it because all I get is a swirly n (think spinning wheel of death) on the screen as it tries to load, which it rarely does.  I bought this in an effort to save money, since I really only need to use it once a week, but that money is wasted as this camera is useless.  I can't imagine needing to use it as a baby monitor, as it is advertised. You'd never know what was happening in the nursery until you got up to check, which rather negates the need for a camera.

91,RyBan,Amazing for the price,"  This camera is amazing for the price!! Summary: it’s not a $200 camera so it won’t act like one, but it’s pretty darn good for how cheap it is. You can see the baby from anywhere in the app, as long as the camera is connected to the home wifi, and you have data or internet on your phone (or tablet). It was exactly what I needed without breaking the bank. Some notes:- The night vision is great- You can manually move the camera from your phone to see what’s going on in the room without physically going in there.- If you have a sound machine, you can’t use the sound detection, it will notify you every like 20 seconds, even with low sensitivity- The motion detection was ok, I feel like it was correct 50% of the time, but that could be because it was viewing through play pen mesh. It would probably be better if I mounted it on the wall.- They fixed the app so that you can add another person so you can both view at the same time, they just have to make an account on the app which isn’t hard. It logs you out if you log into your own account from another device.- The speaker is great, I was at the store and had a convo with my husband through the camera lol- It really does only work on 2.4 internet, I tried the other one and it wouldn’t connect.- Connecting it was a pain sometimes, but lots of the time it was because the camera didn’t have a good enough view of the QR code on my phone.

It will notify you of sounds and motion but you can also turn these features off or schedule them to only monitor at certain times. If you pair with alexa then you can tell her when youre leaving and she will put on guard mode and notify you of glass breaking or smoke alarms or movement. AMAZING value for the price.

95,Burgos Games,Better than expected - Easy Setup,"  I wanted to get a camera device to watch our baby while we were in another room. Having had a really bad experience with some of the infant gadgets like the Owlet, I was skeptical to spend the hundreds of dollars for some of the other infant cams.The Nooie came in a simple box with everything inside. Even has a wall mount and screws in the box.Setup was a breeze. Did a lookup cia the Camera app on the iOS QR code that was in the instructions, downloaded the app, created an account and within a minute I had the device powered on, added to our mesh WiFi and got the live stream from the cam. Super easy!App required very little configuration with night mode enabled by default. The other controls were simple to use such as motion detection and sound detection. The only drawback on the app is not being able to go landscape mode but that’s not a deal breaker for me.You do not need a subscription to live stream from your own network. This is a huge benefit as many of the other devices seem to also require some sort of cloud subscription.If you’re like ya and want something simple that allows you to peek in to see baby while in another room, walking the dog or while you are working this fits that to a T.

96,Carl W.,See updated review. Very happy with the camera now,"  I will be returning this camera as the app is so horrible it's impossible to use. It freezes constantly (search these reviews for the word freeze) which defeats the whole purpose. When the app is functioning it provides a clear picture. But as soon as I try to zoom in or pan around, the picture freezes and I'm unable to control the camera or see what's happening anymore. I have no choice but to force quit the app and start over. It's really too bad because the picture and viewing angle are superb. They really need to update their app so that it's functional.6/2021 Update: Nooie reached out to me and sent me a new camera free of charge with an updated system.  The new update has fixed the freeze issues.  I am happy with the new updated camera.7/30/21: I’m still very happy with the camera, I would definitely recommend it now with the new update.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 23, 2021"
97,Amanda B.,Edited with a new rating,"  The new app made all the difference- customer support at Nooie was very helpful! The new app named just 'Nooie' has to be installed replacing the old app 'Nooie cam'.Edited--The seller reached out to me and sent me a new device which I thought was great customer service. My new camera connected quickly and within seconds was ready to use. I use it as a baby monitor and the sound and motion detection feature with a control setting for detection is pretty on point as is the night vision setting. With multiple kids, it's a simple scroll across my phone when I want to pan between the cribs spaced across the room, zoom in to see which one is awake and trying to wake up the sibling! All in all, I'm very pleased with my new camera!This video monitor was difficult to connect to our home WiFi, and takes a long time to connect each time I turn it on. When it does come on, it pans the room very slowly and is quite glitchy, even when I scroll on the app. So much so that I prefer to use my old non WiFi, stationary monitor which is a lot more reliable. I definitely wouldn’t recommend this one.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2020"
98,Sam Switch,Great camera,"  For the most part this is a great monitor. The night vision and picture clarity is awesome! There are a few minor flaws but mostly with the app required to use this camera. When you use the feature that allows you to talk it freezes so you’re unsure if your message got through and you can’t hear your child’s response. The camera feed lags occasionally, freezing and unfreezing. However that is more to do with my WiFi rather the camera. So my suggestion is to make sure you have a good internet provider. I really love that you can choose the sensitivity of the sound and motion detection. The app will send a notification alert to your phone letting you know sound or motion has been detected. Which is really helpful because you can use your phone and not have the video feed up the entire time your child is sleeping. For the price I highly recommend this camera. It’s a great value.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2021"

Do you like opening and re-closing apps continuously in an effort to make your product work? Do you enjoy spending money for a mic that doesn’t work?

100,G. M. E. ,Works well and has good features,  Disclosure: I am writing this review at the company's request but the opinions are my own.I bought this at a discounted price and it's been totally worth it. I bought it to keep an eye on my new dog when I leave the house and I was worried I'd regret the purchase but it's been invaluable. The speaker/microphone has been VERY useful in soothing him during separation anxieties. The motion tracking follows him as he paces back and forth so I don't have to move the camera around manually to find him. The alerts can be a little too repetitive so I keep those off most of the time but I do use them occasionally since they include screenshots.The only negative I have found so far is that the power cable is far too short so placement is limited. I will need to purchase a longer one to get a better view of the room.Overall I would definitely recommend this product if you're in the market for a camera for your pet or baby!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2020"
101,Susan,Can't beat the price,"  I needed a camera to check in on my puppy in her crate while we potty train. Initially I thought of getting an indoor Nest camera because I have others and they work well, but I couldn't justify spending over $100 on a camera for a dog. I ordered this camera because it had great reviews, and it's greatly exceeded my expectations. The video quality is great in both normal and night vision modes, I love that I can speak through it, and it's been very reliable. I didn't even realize at the time that the camera turns and you can also angle it up and down, which is a huge added benefit. I eventually figured out how to have 2 different accounts access the camera at once, which has been very helpful. The only slight downside for me is that I bring this camera wherever we go with our dog where she might nap in another room (home, work, friends houses...) and theres no easy way to change WiFi networks without completely removing the camera and adding it again. This is a pain to do, but thankfully it's not a daily occurrence for me.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2020"
102,Sammi,CAMERA IS GREAT BUT NOOIE ALWAYS PUSHING CLOUD SUBSCRIPTION,"  This camera offers excellent coverage area (adjustable remotely up and down) and 360 deg span.Somewhat difficult to set up but you will get it done by yourself if you just persist .. customer service is not helpful and way too slow.  By the time you hear from them you will have figured it out, so just be patient with yourself.The one and only negative about this camera is that after I bought the camera, Nooie is constantly trying to get me to subscribe to their Cloud storage.  You cannot see your videos in real time after the first few days.  You have to wait until Nooie ""sends"" them to you and then after repeated attempts to view them, you can finally access them after they hard-sell you 3 or 4 times.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2021"
103,Amazon Customer,Great camera and great price!,"  This product was made well and overall works really well. I am using it as a baby monitor and if the app is up all the time on my phone, its perfect. But it does not work well as night monitor because the alerts aren't loud and annoying enough or even customizable in sound, vibration, or duration of alert. (So if baby wakes up in the middle of the night in distress and you aren't a super light sleeper, you will sleep through it [on my phone it is a very light vibrating sound]. Which defeats the purpose of having a baby monitor for me.)The picture quality is great, motion and voice detection is great. Had an issue setting up and connected to Wi-Fi but my husband had no issues. It does lose WiFi occassionally (the cam is upstairs and on the opposite side of the house).The thing that I would really want in a baby monitor is customized alerts. Currently when motion or voice is detected, I get a light vibrating alert that lasts a second. Other monitors have the screen turn on or have reminder alerts so that if you are sleeping and want to be woken up when the baby is awake, you can be.Also you are currently unable to schedule motion detection or sound at multiple times ina day (like morning and night or before work and after work).Overall great camera though just wish the app worked a little better.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2019"
104,Cynthia K.,Great for pet monitoring,"  I love this thing.  We needed a camera to monitor a pregnant feral cat that we are fostering.  The kitty needs her privacy (she's not too wild, but still scared of humans) but we need to keep an eye on her.  We needed a wifi camera so we could leave the house.  This little camera fit the bill.  And we didn't want a subscription service to record the cuteness.Set Up: I found setting up the nooie cam straightforward and quick.  Plug and play in less than 15 minutes.  Once you play with the nooie app a bit, it's intuitive.  One thing that was a bit tricky was adding another user.  Each person has to set up a nooie account and be invited to that specific device.  I believe there is a way to share the whole nooie ecosystem, but we only have this one camera.Picture Quality:  Very sharp in daylight and surprisingly clear at night in a pitch black room. We have not had any major buffering issues, maybe a second or two.Recording: Recording live video is a breeze and the pictures and videos go right to our iphone's photo app.  I did go buy a 128 gig microSD so we can do playback.  It's not seamless, but it does work.  The camera records in 5 min segments and it takes some patience to find moments you want to see.All in all we are super happy with this cute camera.  The price point is amazing for all the features you get.  It's so good I'm considering buying the nooie doorbell and plug adapters.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2021"

   This is my first time ever buying a video camera but color me impressed! I don’t know about all the other bells and whistles that others may prefer in a video camera but if you only need this for monitoring purposes, and considering the price, then this video camera is amazing. I truly don’t understand the negative reviews. Agreed that setup with the barcode was a bit frustrating but for the price, it’s totally worth it. We only use this to monitor our cat and house when we’re away. I’m really impressed with the quality of the picture at night. My favorite feature is the 360 view that you can control on your device from long distances! I accidentally knocked this little guy off the table but it was durable enough to withstand my clumsiness. I happily give this product my stamp of approval. For all you video camera newbies like me, see below for information I wish I had known (and some of which may have already been addressed in prior reviews).-Unless you’re looking to actually keep a lot of footage over time, you don’t need to purchase cloud storage or an SD card. In fact, there’s a video camera icon on the screen that allows you to record the feed you’re looking at. It automatically saves to your device! Same deal with taking a picture. I don’t know if there are any time limits (but would think there aren’t any) as I’ve only done this for 30 second increments.-As I said above, you can control the camera from your device and it swivels for 360 degrees! I verified this when we were a state away recently. Keep your finger on the screen of your device and swipe to whichever direction you want the video camera to show you. It also goes up and down.-Setup: You’ll need to download the Nooie app and set up an account. Once you do this, a QR code will appear on your device that you’ll need to hold up in front of the video camera to connect it to your device. I highly recommend doing this on a table so you can place the code evenly in front of the camera and so you can see its reflection squarely in the camera. Once the camera connects to the code, you’ll hear a sound to let you know it was successful. From there, setup truly is a breeze.-Love the speaker feature as well. We actually use this to communicate with each other when we’re not in the same room!-Finally, you can download the Nooie app on multiple devices but can only log into the video camera’s feed from one device at a time.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2020"

My only complain would be that I don't know if you can have 2 apps open at the same time on two different phones.

It has positive reviews because they give people free things for writing 5 star reviews.I got this specifically because it said works with Alexa and bought this and the Alexa show together. It does NOT. The picture on Alexa is so blurry, you can’t see anything. The picture quality on the phone is fine I guess. But that’s not the worst part.The app is CONSTANTLY freezing and either shows the loading screen or just a black screen. We have to exit the app and sign back in multiple times for it to finally work. Not great when you really need to see what your kid is doing. To make it worse, when it does this and finally reconnects, it makes an EXTREMELY loud wind chime noise. Not what I need when I am trying to get my toddler to fall asleep. On top of all of this, when it does work, it has a long lag. My husband was watching me put my son to bed, I came out of his room and into the living room and I was STILL showing up on the camera.

109,D Young,Wanted so badly to love it ( UPDATED),  Unfortunately I wanted to love this so badly. Camera is great and the features. But the app for this camera is by far the worst I have had to use yet. It nice its simple but IT IS INCONSISTENT! people are buying this to watch there babies and make sure they are safe when they are not right next to them. You can have the best hardware but if your software can't keep up then its no good. I would highly suggest spending extra and getting a more reputable brand that has good credit when it comes to reliability and there application. Also the wifi needs to desperately be upgraded in this camera it is the worst.UPDATE!NOOIE had reached out to me with an updated app and asked me to try the product out again. So I said sure why not.

110,Renee M.,Great camera for the price!,"  This video camera is an great choice for the price. Video quality is clear in day or night vision. The app allows you to adjust it to most your liking. Installation is a breeze and can be mounted on the base on the wall or just on top of a solid flat surface. Set up wasn't complicated either and had it up and running in a matter of minutes. We originally purchased the Owlet camera and sock as a bundle. However, we didnt think it was all worth the high amount after trying it for a week and returned it. This camera is just as good or better because it can be adjusted. The microphone and speaker so you can speak with your baby are also great features.The only real problems we had with it was that the app was a little tricky to get it to adjust the camera. It was too sensitive and would move more than you wanted. The second issue is that only 1 person can log on to view the camera(s) at a time.

The camera has a nice aesthetic look, easy to set up and the Nooie app is user-friendly as well.The picture quality is better than your average baby monitor (see attached photo taken early morning, with blinds slightly closed). I love how I am able to record live clips and screenshots of what’s happening in the room (my toddlers love standing in front of the camera for “photos”). I also like how I am able to switch the view with just a light swipe via the Nooie app.The two-way communicator is great for when I need to calm baby on my way up or call the hubs down for dinner 😆For the price point, it’s a great little camera!

113,iLuvTech,"Great Price, Great Reliable Camera","  Bought this camera to replace the one we had received when our son was born. The Nooie 360 has immediately been so much better and allowed me to truly sleep at night. This camera has not had many if really any lags or has come disconnected from the WiFi. The times I can recall we’re due to my internet service and had nothing to do with the camera. The motion detection is super sensitive (it can pick up on the fish swimming behind it) as is the sound recognition so I am alerted fairly frequently, which is exactly what I wanted. If I know that I don’t need to be concerned with what’s going on then I just turn off the notifications on my phone or turn off the volume. You can adjust the sensitivity or turn these detections off completely in the Nooie app. I have already recommended this camera/brand to friends with/without babies, pets etc. I have not had to contact customer service because this camera is incredibly user friendly as is the app and I haven’t had any issues. I have an SD card which records movement and sound on a loop which is fine since I’m only using it to monitor my son during his naps and at night. This camera is truly perfect, especially for the price, compared to those incredibly overpriced, name brand “baby monitors” with a separate handheld device, specifically for the monitor. I love that I can check on things if I’m not home or my parents can sign in to watch him dancing or doing something that a video just won’t truly capture.1/8/21 Update: camera is still going strong. Works great, connects without any issues. We have since purchased many of Nooie's other smart products and they all work great and the home app combines all of the devices and cameras perfectly.

114,Lindsay,Worked just long enough to get past return period. Revised - Efforts to fix problems successful.,  INITIAL REVIEW -This product worked for about 60 days. Then it froze. Nothing works at this time. I have had numerous and I mean numerous exchanges with the manufacturer and they have not been able to solve the problem. The return period has passed. I am extremely dissatisfied with the failure of the product. In looking at other negative reviews I find my experience to not be an outlier. I also found a UTube video detailing this product failure problem. I had high hopes. It worked nicely at first.Additional review : Nooie worked very hard to help me solve the problem(s). They provided replacement hardware and it seems they have updated their software. The camera now seems to work very well. I was very dissatisfied with the initial product.

115,Amber Hudson,The App Makes It Useless,"  At first I thought Nooie was the best invention since sliced bread. But over time a severely flawed app effects performance that it is completely worthless as a baby monitor.The night vision and picture quality are great. But the app does not remember/save your motion/sound detection settings. Despite deleting and reloading the app the problem persists. What this has meant is my toddler was able to wake up, leave his crib and room, without the Nooie app sending one notification or alert. Making it completely pointless.In addition- if you ever travel with it- you cannot simply just change the internet connection. You must delete and re-install the camera to your app. Which is simple enough but takes 5-10 minutes. Which becomes a cumbersome task because you have to re-do it again once you return home.This camera has so much potential. Between the price point and the quality of the camera.

116,Kati Bursley,"Affordable, reliable, and excellent customer service","  I am not compensated in any way for this review.I have purchased four of these cameras since January, and I recommend them to others on a regular basis. I gave two as gifts and use the two I have for baby monitors, one in the nursery and one in the living room so that I can still have a visual on my daughter if I have to leave the room momentarily (WFH/STAHM). They have been a lifesaver, set up in minutes and are easy to maintain.Recently, I noticed a bit of a delay in connecting to the camera feed after the iPhone app updated. I emailed Nooie’s customer support and in very short order had a reply from Alma who helped me get back up and running in no time. They pushed out a firmware update and the problem immediately went away. I was provided with prompt, excellent service and am completely satisfied with my experience.I’m not sure why anyone is complaining about Nooie’s support quality. I’ve contacted a few times and always receive the help I need. I have also seen some negative product reviews but frankly cannot understand why.

117,Carolyn,Great Little Camera!,"  The Nooie 360 camera was easy to set up, however, the documentation that came with it and available on line is very minimal.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for this reason.  The app works pretty well, however the pan / tilt operation is a little sporadic.  With little or no documentation on the web site, you just have to play with it to figure out how the controls work.  The Mic and Sound icons really don't look like a mic and a speaker, and they aren't identified in the manual.On the plus side, the picture quality is excellent.  The night vision is excellent also.  Motion detection works good, and the sound is good for such a small device.My overall opinion is that this is a very good camera, that I would recommend and buy again, but the documentation and app need work!

My only take is do NOT buy Alexa like it suggests to do it, I got her for the kitchen to be able to see her while I cook or do my chores as a way of not having to use my phone all the time. It’s a total waste of money since the quality of the image is garbage specially during the night vision.

119,Amazon Customer,Great value,"  I really like the sleek modern design of the 360 Nooie camera. We have nicknamed ours R2.The motion tracking is great (you do need to turn on Motion Tracking in the app). The only issue is when more than one motion is going on, the camera has a hard time decided which one to follow. The ability for the camera to pan helps eliminate the need for multiple cameras because it will cover a much larger portion of the room.You can use a SD card or cloud service to record or you can save directly to your phone (if you hit the record button in the app) Note: automatic motion detection and audio detection recordings need storage, can be either SD card or cloud service.You can adjust the sensitivity to low, medium or high for either motion or sound in the app settings.You can share the camera with a second person as long as they have a Nooie account set.The night vision footage is very clear.It would be nice if the camera supported more than 2.4g.

We recently purchased YI Smart Dome Security Camera X, AI-Powered 1080p WiFi IP and found this one is much much better than Nooie camera. Compared to YI camera, Nooie has poor sound sensitivity and most importantly, you need to go through the setting processing again once it is unplugged and re-plugged back.

I would highly recommend this if looking for a way to see in your home.  The fact that you can turn the camera 360 degrees is a plus.  It shipped out fast with prime.  It came through the USPS.

123,Yaydoom,Compatibility with echo show not consistent,"  The main reason why we got this camera was the compatibility to our echo shows. The set up to our echo shows worked so we can see our baby in her room, however the echos screen just shuts off the nooie skill randomly without us asking it to shut off. Ex. I turn the baby camera on before I go to bed so I can hear and see my baby if she cries at night, but when I wake up to check the show the baby camera is not on. We constantly have to keep asking our echo shows to show baby room. It defeats the purpose of why we got the camera.The footage on the echo shows are also  super delayed. The older version of my echo show there is about a 30 second delay, my newer version is about a 15 second delay. It may not seem much but as a new mom I would like to address if my baby is crying immediately.I also have to keep restarting the app on my phone to show the baby camera, the footage doesn't always show up the first time, it just shows a black or green screen. I did make sure all apps and skills were up to date.One other item I wasn't a fan of is you can't have multiple people viewing the camera in the phone app at the same time . Ex. My husband watches our little one and logs into the app to see the camera. I am at work and want to see the baby. If I did this it would force my husband to log out of the app. I understand they probably put this measure in place for security reasons, but they should have a setting or parameters where you could give permission to allow multiple people to view the camera using the same log in.All in all the camera works fine, picture quality is nice and night mode is great, however if you are using it for the sole purpose of seeing your baby on the echo show, I would not reccommend it. It is not consistent enough for me to trust it.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2021"

I keep his nursery pitch black and the picture was still very clear!(+) Reasonable price for the quality(+) Very sleek design, it will blend perfectly with any nursery theme and decorCons(-) Not really a big one, but I do hope that I can angle the camera lower.(-) You have to open the app constantly to be able to hear baby cries in real time, the motion/sound detection and notifications is not really accurate.I couldn't comment on the longevity yet, since I just got this (will update this review in the future once I got to use it longer) but overall I highly recommend this for baby monitor.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2021"
125,Stockton Bear,"Great buy, highly recommended","  I bought this out of frustration after returning ""the tesla of baby monitors"" which was a total dud. I paid $50 so my expectations were that it would work 50% of the time. I was wrong. This works flawlessly and is incredibly easy to set up. It was different by having to use a QR code to set it up but it worked just fine. The night vision and zoom are great. We use an old Kindle Fire tablet in the living room and it works just fine without any delay. With night vision it's incredibly sharp. I can zoom in on the mesh of the co-sleeper and it's not blurry at all. I constantly get motion/sound alerts so it means it's working. It's silent when you move from side-to-side. I thought there'd be a loud mechanical sound. The two things I can think of that could be improved is the noticeable sound delay (by about a second) and the microphone sensitivity. Overall, I would highly recommend this camera as a baby monitor or to just use around the house.EDIT: I completely forgot about the short power cable. I bought an extension cord because the cable was too short to reach halfway across the room. This is what we do when we place our baby in the co-sleeper.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2019"
126,natalie,Unreliable App and Camera,"  This baby monitor works well maybe 75% of the time but it's really unreliable the other 25%. It occasionally will not connect despite the app saying the internet connection is good. It also picks up tiny movements like a bug flying by or a change in the light from outside. I've also watched my baby move around significantly and it didn't register the movement. Also we turned off notifications in the app but we're still getting dozens of notifications a day, most of which are when our baby isn't even in the crib. It's a good thing these aren't super expensive because we might end up having to buy a different one if it gets to be too annoying.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2021"
127,N,Read reviews online not,"  Don’t waste your time or money on this. I read all the reviews on amazon and was excited. Got it set it up, and it kept telling me my WiFi password was wrong. So I tried to problem solve by going online, others suggested maybe the internet wasn’t compatible or the modem was full. ( it should be able to identify what the issue actually is but apparently any network issue is labeled as a wrong password). So I unplugged stuff, disconnected some stuff from WiFi And made sure I didn’t have my extender on. Still nothing , I must have spent an hour an a half trying to do it thinking I was just stupid and doing it wrong. From the beginning I was on the app where there is really no technical assistance available . I decided I was done, and went back online and continued to read all the negative reviews and ppl talking about how they also relied on amazing reviews and were upset . So I decided to do research for a good indoor camera with 360 viewI ordered a new one off amazon, got it and plugged it in, downloaded the app and within 20 seconds was all set up",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2020"
128,SL,So much better than Lollipop at a fraction of the price,"  It was important to us to have a monitor that we could watch from our phones. I got the Lollipop monitor when my baby was born 17 months ago, and it never worked right. Constantly disconnected from wifi, consumed lots of battery, just problem after problem. I even thought the problem might be with our home wifi bandwidth, so I decided to pickup a ""cheap"" wifi monitor on Amazon to test that theory. Enter Nooie: perfect from the beginning. 3 minutes of setup and haven't had to think about it since - it just works, and it is less battery-intensive than the Lollipop at less than a third of the price. I am not being paid to write this review, just had to share. The only thing I would improve would be to have the ability to stay logged into the app on more than one device simultaneously using the same account. My husband has his own account that he uses on his phone, but sometimes I like to monitor from my tablet and it's annoying to have to login to my account every time I switch between my phone and tablet. I could create another account using my secondary email address, but I feel like that's an unnecessary step. Other than this relatively minor inconvenience, I can't recommend it enough!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2021"
129,SL,App is terrible!!,"  Look at the app reviews. It is terrible. The speaker function makes it constantly glitch, freeze up, and load. Makes it unusable. The camera itself looks really clear and does everything it’s suppose to. Tracks and moves around, but even that is glitchy sometimes. I have great internet and never have problems with stuff loading or being slow so that’s not the problem.  I see multiple people complaining about the same problems since an recent update.

131,kat,It fails when you need it most,"  I bought this in May 2021 because we had a litter of 10 puppies. I used it for watching them when I tried to sleep an hour at a time, and when I was in a different room from them, so I could watch them and not be concerned. Also, after 3 months when we needed to both leave the house at the same time, but still keep an eye on them, I thought it would come in handy.Well, it mostly works and is decent, but, when it doesn't work, it is infuriating to get started up again. It randomly unpairs from my iPhone and says there is no phone paired and I have to set it up completely again, even the name of the camera. It also randomly unpairs when we leave the house- sometimes- but not all of the time. Additionally, it decides not to show the area where the camera is focused, even if I just looked at it a moment ago. It is very annoying and selective in when and how it wishes to work.Also, if the camera is not working and just spins, but you are away from home, you can't reset it unless you want to re-pair the whole thing when you get home.I know, you get what you pay for, but I really hoped for more. I have been planning to post a review, but today was the final straw and I had to do it now. It unpaired again when I was walking our other dogs and it took me 4 tries to get the damned thing to work again...so, roughly 20 minutes....",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2021"
132,Danielle,I really enjoy all my Nooie products.,"  So I actually purchased this after experiencing a major emergency with my family/household, where having something like this would have helped out tremendously. I had purchased Nooie products previously and I've really not had any kind of issue with them. They've all worked flawlessly.I was impressed with how easy this was to setup. It took less than 5 minutes and I was up and running. Another 5 and the firmware update was installed. I checked and changed my settings to my preferences. It really was simple for anyone that has a relatively decent level of understanding of modern day technology.I feel safer already, and I think I'd consider purchasing additional cameras for other rooms in the future.

133,Alicia Becovic,Video viewing on microSD is a deal breaker,"  The good:-decent image quality-good motion tracking-good panning up and down-decent night vision-can take microsd card of 64 gigsThe bad (and man, it is awful):-The video files recorded are not shown to the user as a file that can be clicked on. You are given a time-line that has a tiny vertical slit to indicate a file where there was motion recorded. You will spend about 10 minutes to try to line up the time line with the vertical slit so you can actually view the video that was recorded. Perhaps the worse file viewing experience I have ever had - this makes it a deal breaker. I should be able to just click in a file that represents the recording and view it instantly. If they did that, then this product would probably get 5 stars.***Wow, just realized that there are NO VIDEO CONTROLS AT ALL. You cannot pause the video. You cannot stop the video. You cannot fast forward, rewind, jump to another part of a video, etc...It is just play or move onto another ""time line"" period. Wow.

134,Oscar Hurtado,Only device on my wifi that has problems.,"  I have a very powerful WiFi setup at home, using WiFi 6 protocol. All devices on my WiFi (all across my home) are very stable, except for these cameras. I have three of them, in three different rooms. All three give us problems when trying to connect to them to view our kids. The video stream buffers and spins. Sometimes it doesn't connect at all. I think the wifi module these cameras have are very cheap, and perform very poorly. Not to mention, it also only supports 2.4ghz band, not 5ghz band. Outdated, unreliable network module in these.Look elsewhere if you're looking for a reliable video feed to check in on your loved ones.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2021"
135,Oscar Hurtado,Awesome monitor for the price!,"  After testing this camera for a couple weeks I must say this is a pretty good investment for the price. The monitor I originally wanted was over $160 and I can't justify spending that much money on something ill only use at night or occasionally during the day. Pairing it to my phone was super easy, the picture quality is amazing (i can see my LO breathing), and night time vision is even better. The alerts I get sent to my phone are right in target when my LO wakes up, moves or makes any sort of noise. I love that I can customize the motion and sound settings to pick up low, medium, high motions/sounds. The 360 view is amazing as well and I love that I can zoom in on our LO. Even after we done using this as a baby monitor, I love the fact that we can continue to use it in our home while we are away as security or even for our pets.

136,Mark H. Kolman,"Good hardware, good price, limited app","  Love the camera hardware. The company does not seem sketchy. The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars is the controls(or lack there of) within the app. Know this:1.) only one account can be logged into the camera at one. You have to re log in if you get booted.2.) can’t send e-mail or photo alerts. Just video streaming from SD or amazon cloud.2B.) unless you pay for cloud service all a thief would need to do is take the camera. Now you don’t have the video or a photo3.) no way other than the app to access camera.4.) minimal visualization of advanced network config.5.) no preset position on camera. To move the camera you have to swipe across the screen. It isn’t exact and it’s laggy.

137,Lovely,Solid option,"  This thing is a lifesaver. My babe takes naps in his room. Tiny naps. Micro naps. So whenever I manage to get him down, I'm running around trying to get things done. While I'm loading the dishwasher I can check on him. When I'm scarfing down a bagel I can check on him. When I'm vacuuming I can check on him. Just a few hang ups: It's not all that consistent. I'll get a failed message many times that I'm trying to check the live feed, so I'll reset the app on my phone before I can get it to work. Also, it makes a startup noise when it's plugged in and takes a bit before I can get an image, so moving it from room to room can be a bit difficult. But the night vision is clear, the ability to move the camera is useful, and I'm able to talk to my baby as well as hear him. There's a few seconds of lag, but whatever. Getting it set up wasn't all that hard. Overall, given how many camera options out there, this is a solid choice for the price",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 10, 2020"
138,Lovely,Good hardware with app limitations,"  The camera is a great value for the price and works well for our baby. HD video, night vision, sound and motion alerts, and 2-way audio were all features I wanted. Pan and tilt plus motion tracking is a plus!The only thing holding this back is a mediocre app. Often times, I have to close and reopen the app because alert notifications open to a blank version of the app where I'm logged out for some reason. Simply closing and reopening refreshes and the app remembers I'm logged in. Also, there's no snooze alerts button anywhere. Would love to be able to snooze alerts if we're in the room with baby, then turn them back on easily once we leave. App takes a little while to load the video, but should be good enough to monitor baby. Also, no background audio either, which I feel like is an app limitation. Good to have 2 factor authentication and the image is very clear.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2020"

140,R G N,Decent camera for the money,  Set up took a couple of tries. It’s worked well except when we had a power outage it kicked my mom off the camera. I had to send her a new invitation. Set up instructions left a little to be desired. DO NOT download the gray Nooie app. Download the blue one. Instructions did not specify this. The blue works much better. I couldn’t even use the 360 movement on the gray one and it kept cutting in and out. Moving the pic with your finger is WAY to sensitive. It is hard to get the camera pointed this way. I also don’t like the motion and sound detection. They are too sensitive also but my son is almost two so that wasn’t as important at this point. He’s a loud screamer anyway so I chose to keep the camera. It does enough for me. Hope this helps.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2022"

I love the 360 capability that you can control from your phone and that it has a motion tracking option.  This camera also has EXCELLENT night vision. The fact that it is not cordless is good and bad. Great because you dont have to worry about this running  out of battery but it can limit your mounting options depending on what/where your using it for. It took forever for me to get it connected to my phone but once I did I haven't had any problems.  I would HIGHLY recomend this camera!Update: this camera worked great for a few months and now the motion detector no longer works.

The night vision goes in and out at times 'adjusting' itself like you're flipping a light off and on when the room is the same darkness. Cam goes out at random too.

Even though it says it connects to my echo device with a screen, it doesn't work (and yes I was sure to enable the skill). I had to download Google Playstore on my Kindle Fire because there is no app in the Amazon Appstore for it.It also does not let only the administrator get the notifications.

This installed fairly easily, the only problem that we had was it would not pair with our Wi-Fi, even on the 2.4 recommended channel. I ended up having to set up another router, which did not solve the problem immediately and we had to do a factory reset on the product right out of the box so if you had a similar problem, that may be what you need to do. Futhermore, the camera quality is good for the price, however in order to utilize this as a baby monitor, we had to mount it to the ceiling to see into the crib and when viewed on either our phones in the app or on the alexa the image is upside down and there is no way to adjust it.

While I can't say that the camera is 100% perfect, it absolutely does the job. Sound detection is fantastic (sometimes a little too good when I got nonstop notifications for a visiting barking dog), motion detection is usually good about 75% of the time (occasionally it will just send off in an opposite direction when my dog is squarely in same position). The audio levels are perfectly fine, but the voice feature doesn't work. The few times I've tested it, it comes in very garbled and mightttt pick up half a word. Luckily, I don't want to use that feature because I think it just teases my dog more. Playback via the app (I use SD, haven't tried cloud) is rough - I still haven't really figured it out, but thankfully I don't need it often.However, the panning and zooming ability is fantastic. It's exactly what I wanted/needed. I love that it's SO easy to turn on and off when I want wherever I want so it isn't filming me when I'm just sitting at home.

Being able to see what is going on Live in my house and move the camera with a swipe of my finger on my phone's screen is pretty darn cool. Also, having the ability to listen and watching at the same time live is a nice way to keep tabs on the kids when you have to run to the store.Lastly, using it as a two-way radio is a pretty nice feature too. We were able to call out to our daughter on the way home from the store and ask her to turn the oven on to get it preheated for dinner.Yes, it connects to your home WiFi network.Yes, you can access it through the Nooie app from outside of your home network using your cellular data.

So I can open the app and look back up to 7 days which is very helpful for my second home. If there was ever a break-in I would have footage. Also the sensors on this device, the motion and soundtracking, work very well so with both those on if someone did breach my security and get into my home it will send me warning that its detected motion and or sound which would prompt me to look at the camera, if the camera had been located and disabled by an intruder I would have footage leading up to that from the cloud service and would be notified via the sound and motion sensor.

It’s faster for me to get out of bed and go check on my child than it is to wait the three minutes to get the video to load. You shouldn’t have the “clear the cache” every single time you want to view the video on your phone, and if you don’t clear the cache it will honestly take 4 minutes for a live stream video to load.

I had a Motorola and their Hubble app works in the background of your phone so you can listen to it while doing other things. This app doesn’t work that way.2. The microphone isn’t very good. It cuts out a lot when you are trying to use the 2 way talk and is very delayed.3. Setting it up on an Amazon Fire table is not user friendly. You should just be able to download the Nooie app, but they don’t have the app available on the fire tablet store. So you have to use Alexa, but when doing that it isn’t live. It is about 30+ seconds behind. So by the time I see my kid getting out of bed, they are already down the hall. It’s not helpful when trying to keep a toddler in bed.If none of those things would bother you, then it is a great camera!

You can configure the camera using the app.You can share the camera view with others too.My favorite feature is that it has 360 degree view from app, I can rotate the camera remotely.I see only one downside. This camera is not shipped with any monitoring device so you have to use your personal phone or tablet to view the live feed which can drain out your battery if you are watching live feed for longer time. But it wasn't a deal breaker for me. I am fine with watching my kids on my mobile even though it drains out my battery. In a way its better because picture quality is better on mobile phones rather than tiny LCD monitor shipped with traditional baby monitors.I have paid more than double the cost of this camera for very limited features in past. This is definitely next generation technology and way to go!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2019"
157,Dailyn W.,Not cordless!,"  I’m so frustrated. I searched for rechargeable nanny cam’s and saw this one with great reviews on quality. Ordered it, plugged it in to connect it as instructed. Took 6 tries to get it to connect then the firmware needed to be updated. It kept “failing” or showed “update unsuccessful” in which the cam won’t work without it. Finally, after 45 minutes of restarting the app it finally updated and the camera started working. Unplugged it to take it to my daughters room and it shut off! It is not rechargeable or wireless!

158,Nola Dogwood,"Buyer beware - Poor customer service, unit no longer operational","  UPDATED REVIEW:(After a few months of continuous use)Monitor no longer rotates fully and will not connect to any devices. We tried all troubleshooting options on the manufacturer website, including reconfiguring our modem, changing WiFi password, ensuring on WPA2, connecting via phone hotspot. Reached out to Nooie customer service several times via email and no response. My husband had to run to the store and buy a replacement monitor from Vtech and we returned this unit. It seems that initially, these Nooie monitors work well, however once firmware updates occur, it becomes defective and customer service does not respond. Most of these 5 star reviews are probably due to the “free gift” that is promised by the seller.Exactly what we needed for our nursery! Some pros and cons that we have noticed after setting up the camera today;PROS:-video quality-able to rotate-night vision-able to use app via phone or Echo Show-Clear audio (one way, incoming from nursery)-Recording/photo functionCONS:-rotation is limited and a bit delayed in app-Two way audio function not working as intended (cannot hear/delayed audio when talking through phone app)There are some functions we have not tested yet.

159,Robert Baker,"Updated review, awesome company, great product.","  Update: The customer service from this company is outstanding. I’ve never expected much from sellers other than Amazon directly, so I left this review and ordered a replacement hoping the second one would work. It did work. The first one wasn’t defective. Apparently I ordered the camera right as they were updating their apps, and I happened to download it before a pan/tilt option was fixed. It works great, I love the camera. The company reached out to me and apologized for the inconvenience and even sent me a free outdoor camera. I will definitely be buying more Nooie products from here on out.Camera won’t pan or tilt. I’ll be returning it. I’ve messed with all the settings I possibly could on the app, unplugged it, plugged it back in, uninstalled the app, reinstalled it.

160,Me,Worth the money,"  Quality is very good, initial set up was not difficult. The quality of the picture is good, the night vision is good, the latency of moving the camera and angle is what I expected and should not be held against the product.A few things need improvement around sharing accounts because it was not intuitive to add the user to the home, then edit the camera and share that device. If you were to re-design the layout where the Home tab showed the camera and you could identify where to change the settings for the camera this would go a long way.In total, this is a great purchase for the price point.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2021"
161,MacKenzie Lenz,Best Bang for the Buck!!!,"  I purchased the Nooie Cam 360 as a security camera. I examined tons of different models from a variety of brands. This camera met all of my needs and is definitely the most bang for the buck. I caught a special Amazon ""Lightning Deal"" and got it for $32.99. With Dynamic Noise Reduction and Color Enhancement, the 1080p video quality is excellent. The night vision is nothing short of stunning. It uses ""Gamma Correction"", so the infrared images are not washed out or grainy and have plenty of contrast. The night vision literally looks as crisp, clear and clean as daylight, only in B&W. The camera is ridiculously easy to set up. Using a QR code was a brilliant idea. Just make sure you're on a 2.4 Ghz network for the setup and pairing process. This is only for the setup process. Once paired, you can switch your smartphone back to 5 Ghz, if you're using a dual-band router. The Nooie will remain connected to your 2.4 Ghz band. This is the #1 reason people give this camera negative reviews. They don't read the setup instructions and don't realize this. The built-in speaker is loud and clear. The microphone is sensitive enough to hear the faintest room activity through your phone. My router is about 20 ft. away from the camera, but it's on a different floor of my house. The connection is rock solid and stable. It's never lost connection. The camera will send alerts to your phone if it detects motion and/or sound. You can turn these features on/off, and even set a schedule for when to detect either. This way, the camera's not sending you alerts when you're home and within camera view. The motion tracking pan & tilt is whisper quiet, so as not to attract attention if recording a home intrusion. That, combined with the ability to deactivate the ""Status Light"" makes this unit stealthy. The app is well executed, includes all of the necessary features and yet is simplistic in design. The camera's design is inconspicuous and elegant. People have commented that it looks somewhat like an air freshener. I can see the resemblance. The entire base of the camera has a rubber ring, running the full circumference, so it stays put and won't mar your furniture. I honestly can't find one thing to complain about with this camera, and believe me, I've tried. So, if you're looking for an inexpensive, quality camera to monitor your baby, pet or house, look no further. Buy the Nooie Cam 360. You won't regret it!Setup Tips:If your first attempt to pair the camera with the app is unsuccessful, reset the camera first before trying again.  There's a tiny pin hole on the body.  Just insert a straightened paperclip into the hole and press for about two seconds.I keep reading reviews complaining that this camera won't work on a 5GHz network.  These people are obviously not very tech savvy.  Otherwise, they would know the reason for this.  The difference between 2.4 GHz and 5GHz is range and bandwidth. 5GHz provides a faster data transfer rate, but at a shorter distance. 2.4GHz offers a greater range, but at a slower speed.  When talking about WiFi cameras, range is the primary concern, not speed.  The wireless signal must penetrate through walls and/or floors.  The data transfer speed (for this purpose) is irrelevant.  You will not see any visible different between the two frequencies.  As long as the video image is smooth and not choppy, the added speed of a 5GHz network offers no benefit.  To the contrary, the decrease in range is a detriment.  This is the reason every WiFi camera I've seen on Amazon, also only works on a 2.4GHz network.Some people have stated that this camera will not connect to a dual-band router.  This is NOT true.  Most modern routers are dual-band.  You have to know how to ""force"" your cellphone to connect (and stay connected) to only the 2.4GHz band during the pairing process.  If your WiFi password for your 5GHz network is ""stored"" in your phone, you must select ""Forget Network"".  This doesn't actually forget the network.  It merely deletes the WiFi password for the 5GHz band.  This forces the phone to only connect to the 2.4GHz band.  Once camera pairing is complete, you can reverse that process if you'd like your phone to stay on the 5GHz band.Usage Tips:When manually panning the camera via the app, you can't touch the phone's screen and drag your finger ""in one motion"".  It takes a second for the app to detect your finger.  You have to touch the screen and give it a second to recognize your finger.  Then, slowly drag your finger in the desired direction.  Remember, this touch control command is being sent over a wireless network.  It's not the same as a ""local"" touch command on a phone app, thus the added time needed.Nooie Cam App:I noticed a problem with the app disconnecting from the camera after being closed for several minutes.  There were a few other minor bugs.  I contacted Nooie Support and received a reply within hours.  I was advised that they were aware of the issues and were working on fixes.  There have been three updates to the app, including two beta releases, all within the last two weeks.  I tested the different versions and reported back to Nooie Support.  They addressed everything in a timely matter.  Due to their quick reply and fixes, I didn't let this affect my rating of the camera.  For anyone who isn't familiar with how beta versions work, here's the deal.  Beta versions are still in the testing mode.  The developers will collect input from actual users, implement fixes and test the final result.  Only then, will it be released to the general public.  This is a normal process with all software development.  They'll likely make other tweaks and enhancements in future versions, so check Google Play and the App Store regularly.Latest Version:  1.7.7, Released 9/28/19",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 20, 2019"
162,Evelyn,Smart phone connectivity may vary,"  The initial set up fairly easy. I connected the device to my Android phone( one Plus 6t). Navigating the app is a bit  tricky, I kept feeling lost trying to find certain features as they're not so clear. My main issue is my family members could not set up their accounts, the device would not sync. After several attempts with their iphones, no success. As the main account manger,  the members you invite must FIRST set up their account, then the manger will add them.

164,Ray,"So far it's great, especially for the price.","  Update: The camera is still great and the night vision is very good. Highly recommend.So far so good. This camera was very easy to set up and pair with my phone. I failed the first time because I picked the wrong camera type, but that's on me. You have to set up an account with Nooie in order to use this camera, which I don't like, but it wasn't very invasive (didn't ask many personal questions). The picture is very clear and responsive, only about a second of delay. I love the option to turn the status light on or off. It's not bright, but you might not want people to immediately be drawn to the camera. I haven't tried the night vision yet, so no comment there but I'll update this review once I do. The motion sensing works great and notifications on my phone are very fast.  It's especially nice that you can set days & times for that to be on or off.  The only real negative I've found so far is that the power cord is a little short. I simply swapped it out for a longer one I already had since it's a standard Micro USB to USB cable. But the one that came with this camera has a circular end to fit all fancy like in the camera. Unfortunately, that means I can't repurpose it for my phone, but whatever. In summary, so far this camera is great, especially for the price. I'll be sure to update if that changes.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2019"
165,D. Duarte,Worked so fantastically.,"  I had bought this for 2 purposes. One was because my wife and I were planning to have a baby and to use it for when the baby was born. The second reason was that my father was on his way out of this world and didn't have very long left to live. He was given a time from anywhere between 1-6 months. So we figured we would get it and set it up in my house to help keep an eye on my father when I needed to go to work so that I can check on him frequently whenever I had a chance. The fact that I could talk to my father through the Nooie cam when I was at work to reassure him that everything was okay and to call for help if I saw anything afoot. About a month later he passed away but during the time I was using it, it worked like a dream and made it easier for my peace of mind when I had to work.

166,Blayre,A huge improvement from my last camera,"  I have used a different brand camera for the last couple years in my kid's room. Although the previous camera was ok, it had several different issues both with the app and the camera itself. So far I really like this camera. It has great picture quality, is very smooth with it moves and doesn't draw attention to itself. The only issues I see are small ones, 1st the screws provided are very flimsy and strip easily even when just using a screwdriver, so I had to find other screws. Then 2nd, if the camera is mounted on the wall it has some limitation in how much you can view. For instance, I have my camera mounted on the wall opposite the door for my kid's room, I can see most of the room, but I can't see up to the wall or door that are across the room because of the angle limitations of the camera. It's not a big deal though, since the main purpose of the camera is to see inside the room.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2020"
167,Beth,Good baby monitor,  Loving this camera so far! Got it for a baby monitor in my youngest room and it works great. I can’t think of any complaints. I turned off the motion notifications just because it would blow up my phone and its not necessary for us. I keep it on live when she’s napping/at night and it works like any other baby monitor. I have used the Kasa one in the past and didn’t like it because while on live view it times out every 30 minutes and stops so you have to constantly push continue.

170,A. Robbins,Works great with Echo Show for constant viewing,"  I got this because the Blink camera offered in promo's with the Echo Show would only stay active for 5 minutes of viewing. I work from home and with Covid I need to be able to watch my children from my work space in the house while they are in the living room/kitchen area. I plan to buy another to put in the kitchen. The motion detection is a great idea until it catches motion in a mirror and then stops there while my children are on the other side of the room. I haven't tried mounting it to the wall but I have it sitting on my entertainment center and it doesn't show the whole room the way the Blink camera does. I don't know if that can be solved with a lens or if that is it's limit but it's still worth it! The ""live"" view is slightly delayed by a couple of seconds or so, I can see my children walking to my room to knock on my door as they are already knocking. Overall, as a ""baby monitor, pet monitor, live monitor"" for long viewing this is the camera to get. If you want something for short viewing or just motion detection recording I would go with Blink.Comparing the two cameras is like apples and oranges so if there is a camera that could incorporate all the aspects of each that would be my choice but for now I will have both the Blink and Nooie.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2021"

Fortunately, this has become one of the cameras most used for keeping an eye on the dogs while we are away. The motion detection does a surprisingly great job alerting to and following movement from our two pups at home.  The camera quality is adequate at 1080p, and the microphone and speaker allow for two-way communication. The app is easy to use and you are able to pop a sim-card in for storing video without having to pay for a cloud subscription, however, that IS an option if you so please.The one and only small gripe I have with the application's software is a semi-buggy ""swipe to pan and tilt"" function. Sometimes, it's a bit too sensitive. If there were a virtual direction pad paired with the swipe functionality, this would be perfect. Sometimes, when swiping left or right to swivel the camera, it will suddenly move 180º and fully up to the ceiling.Other than that, this camera is perfect!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2019"

First off, you cannot log in to view this camera from different devices without forcing a logoff from other devices. Meaning you have to log in every single time to view the camera unless you view it from the same device constantly. Night Vision is good but daylight quality is awful and pixelated. When the camera switches between night vision and regular it makes a loud clicking noise. It seems sensitive to any light source for night vision and sometimes will click back and forth over and over. One of the main issues we have with this camera is that it will freeze and you have no idea its frozen.

I bought them specifically to monitor my dog while I'm away from home. I love that I can move the camera around to see other angles of the room and the night vision is spectacular. The Nooie cam app is very user friendly and I could easily add multiple cameras to it.  The motion detection is spot on. However, I haven't received any sound alerts yet but that might require changing some settings in the app. I really like that it has the ability to save footage on a micro SD card and that I'm not required to pay for cloud storage (however, it is an option) and I don't have to pay any monthly subscriptions. The app is 100% free. You can also take pictures or video from the live feed in the app and they will save directly to your photo gallery for easy sharing with family or on social media.To be honest, I really wanted to buy a furbo camera so I could also send treats to my pup while I'm away but Nooie's specs were literally identical to furbo without the treat popping ability. It was a no brainer to purchase the Nooie 360 when considering the price point and good reviews. You can buy 2 for half the price of the other. I'm really happy I did.

I bought a holder for it just in case and that is very useful since I don't want to wall mount it cause I live in an apartment. I don't use the motion detection because he sleeps in our room and then we would get notified everytime we walk in our room. I did try it out though and I like that you can select a small square of the screen for motion detection instead of the whole area. the picture quality is good and so is the night vision. the actual camera is great but the stream and connectivity is horrible. when this works it's great, and I really enjoy the range of coverage you can get, even though I wish the horizonal movement could be more. if there is any large movement the stream loads constantly which kinda makes it useless. it takes a while to set up as the company barely send instructions with the package. I had to reinstall the app 4 times for it to work consistently and still there can be long load times. there is a two way audio which works fine one way but I can't hear audio from the stream. you have to pay a subscription to get previous playback which I have no problem with cause that's not what I got it for and the subscription seems reasonably priced. all in all it's ok, but since I'm using it to check on my baby and not an empty house or a dog I'm going to return it and get a nest camera instead.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2021"
186,K Milburn,Mostly pretty good,"  The camera and all its functions are good. I actually bought a second for another room but when I kept the motion detection on I kept noticing a weird noise. When I did a bit of detective work, I discovered it was coming from the camera every time it would rotate to follow anything!  It was a kind of creepy moaning noise so I had to turn off the motion detection!  The first one still works like a charm and is very quiet and respectful!  The picture quality of both is good. If you’re looking to be able to carry on a conversation with someone through the camera, don’t buy this one though. Even my dogs can’t hear me speak to them through in the middle of the night when things are very still!",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2020"
187,Felicia Gallagher,Love this monitor,"  We have had our monitors for a year now. I love being able to check in when I am not home. The picture quality is awesome, night vision is great! The motion detection is ok but not amazing. Sometimes it over rotates when tracking things. We currently have 6 Camera's.  The set up is super easy.  (Samsung phone) Also note if you do not have good wifi, then make sure to get a booters. Keep in mind, if you have a poor wifi connection it doesn't connect well. It is not device messing up, it's the wifi connection. We have wifi booter and all 6 camera's work great. When setting up make sure to switch over to the 2g wifi when connecting. Then you can turn your phone back over to your 5g connection after set up. The one thing, I hope they can improve is being able to view multiple monitors at the same time. I wish, I could watch at least 2 at the same time. Then tap the screen to veiw one if I needed to see something closer. That would make this set up perfect. But other then minor things. I highly recommend this monitors. I will say it's really easy to switch in between cameras.Update! They came out with a New app and yes there are few things they are working out but now we have live veiw on multiple cameras now. Which is a game changer for me. They have great customer service and Enola helped me and was fast on response and help solve my issues. I love that Nooie is constantly improving. I would 5 star it but it's not quite perfect yet because but it's getting close! I love my cameras!",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2020"
188,Kaci,"Didn’t work! Super delayed, horrible picture quality.","  I was very disappointed with this product. It wouldn’t connect to my WiFi long enough to work. I’ve had a few cameras like this (different brands) and never had a problem. I bought this to watch the puppy in his crate since he likes to escape and it was horrible. The picture was all blurry, the night vision made everything look dark so I couldn’t actually see him in his crate and it was so delayed. I could walk in front of the camera and then five minutes later I would see myself doing that on my phone. Would not recommend! *** To replace this one I went to target, bought a hi-tech nanny cam that came with a screen AND connects to my phone (that requires the same internet as this camera) and the footage is clear as day (even the night vision). *** So I wouldn’t recommend this camera, there are cameras for $20 more that are 100x better.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2020"

I was very pleased with the quality at any price, the price toys low only made it a no-brainer. I like that it came with a wall mount but the camera is limited with the angle it can point up, I solved with a wedge to propt it up slightly, now we can see the whole room if she climbs out of bed.

It comes with a mount kit which makes it easy to move out of the way so my son doesn’t mess with it. I also love that there is not a required subscription model like some other cameras.

192,P,Worked okay for 9 months and then it stopped working saying incorrect wifi password,"  I bought this camera in September 2020 and it worked well during the daytime. The motion detection worked but not all the time it was selective. I used it as a security camera and it worked well enough during the daytime that I paid the $5 per month for recordings, but there was absolutely no night vision once the sun went down there was nothing but a black screen until dawn.  Still I was satisfied until it began not working intermittently and chirping ""incorrect wifi password"" when it wasn't working. I was busy and didn't have time to deal with it. I emailed the company and asked for help and never received a response so I cancelled the $5 a month recording that I was paying them and stored the camera away until I had more time to figure it out. (I got tired of it working and then not working and chirping at me throughout the day.) Well last week I had time to deal with it and pulled the camera out and reinstalled it from scratch on my new cell phone and guess what - it won't even install saying ""incorrect wifi password"".  I checked and double checked and my password is indeed CORRECT. I will send one last email to the manufacturer and if they help me this time, I will change this review.

194,GoPack7,Great baby monitor,"  We bought this to replace our Danale camera, which is the same company this one comes from. The problem with the Danale one is that if it ever got disconnected from the WiFi, it would LOUDLY say ""wifi disconnected"" while my son was sleeping and disturb him. The Nooie camera doesn't make any noise if it becomes disconnected and has to reconnect. The picture quality is also far superior, as is the zoom ability. We like that we can turn the camera remotely to watch him in other parts of his room while he plays independently. We don't use the motion/sound detection features, so I can't speak to their efficacy.One downside is that getting it to connect can be a little tricky, and everytime you move the camera and have to unplug it, you have to delete the camera from the app and restart the connection process. It was frustrating getting it going, but it's been working really well for us the past couple of months.

After reading the reviews, the details and description of the camera, and noting the price we decided to give it a shot.  The Nooie does not disappoint.  It was very easy to set up and the picture quality is excellent.  My husband set the camera up on his log in and I all created a log in. He was then able to share the camera with me through the app, so we can both view the camera at the same time.  It tracks movements and moves around 360 degrees dependent on where the movement is coming from.  We’ve practiced talking into the app and our voices come in clear on the monitor.  The unit must be plugged in and the wire isn’t super long but we make it work.  No subscription needed to access video.

There is an app using which you can connect more than one cam.

The only thing that didn’t work for me was the notification settings. I set it to notify me of baby crying during the hours that my child normally sleeps but I was getting notifications all the time for other sounds around the house that weren’t crying so I just turned all notifications off. At some point I’ll try giving someone a call to figure out how to adjust my preferences. My house is small enough though that I always hear my kid from any room I’m in so right now it’s not a necessary feature. One other thing that would have been nice to be logged in to multiple devices at one time.

There is an option to film or take pictures that will be downloaded on your phone/tablet, but you can also use the SD card for continued recording.My only complaints are:1) every time you open the up it takes a bit to  get the live view running and if you switch on your phone to another app and then return, it will take again a bit to reload the live view. Sometimes you actually need to close the app and reboot.2) the camera is supposed to track movement but none of mines do it.

This camera has woken my child up a few times due to the camera resetting itself and chiming altering you that the camera is on. Connecting to the internet and seeing up the camera is a hassle and can require you to set up again if left unplugged for long periods of time.One big kicker is that the seller super e from Nooie contacted me regarding a free camera to review  if I have them a 5 star rating on this camera. As some one who would test a new upcoming camera I think you would want to know the truth and not just try to buy your reviews.Overall I would recommend this as a Good budget camera.

The sound/motion tracking sometimes get confused because we have our near a window and if something drives by we could find the camera looking into the curtains but that is easy to fix just go into the app and manually change where it is looking.

214,brianna,Exceeded expectations - Fantastic baby monitor!!,"  I am absolutely blown away at the quality we’ve received with this camera and the price we paid for that quality! In the past we have always purchased Motorola monitors for our babies/children and found they they were reliable but only for a somewhat brief period of time. The picture with Motorola was subpar, connection was alright, sound quality was meh...customer service was ridiculous. Charging eventually crapped out.Right from the jump, this camera exceeded my expectations. I enjoyed the simple packaging, and what I read in the directions pamphlet. Setup was easy - the part that tripped me up a bit is when the QR code pops up, you have to CONTINUE to hold it in front of the camera even after the first ding you hear. I didn’t do that the first time and ended up having to start the process over. Very minor hiccup in the scheme of things. You can tell that setup was meant to be simple and very user friendly. The phone app is very easy to use (I have the app on my iPhone 12pro max) and the picture quality from the monitor is SO SO SO much better than what we are used to. Sound quality is also great! I am looking forward to seeing how this camera holds up over time and eager to purchase more for the rest of our home.EDIT: Since ordering our first Nooie 360 camera, we have since ordered two more! Setup was easy peasy with those too and the Nooie app still works great. And customer service was superb - Alma helped to make sure my ordering experience went above and beyond. Emailing back and forth was a bit cruddy but otherwise great. The only issue we’ve encountered thus far has been with the app itself when we try to do the two-way talking feature.

I didn’t purchase a monitor for my 17 month old until now due to her being so close to my bedroom and just checking on her. I purchased this camera on Amazon prime day and I must say I’m really impressed.I personally do not need a constant running camera, I just need to check on my baby as I feel necessary. So this camera works excellent for my needs. The camera is clear and the sound as well. Night vision is excellent as well.

220,Julianna,Stop working after a couple months,"  Worked great when I first received it. Connected the first time no problem. I was able to check on my pup at any moment at any time. Sometimes it would lose connection, so I would repair it- no problem. For the last 2 weeks the amount of time I’ve spent trying to repair the connection is embarrassing and so frustrating. There’s nothing wrong with my wifi, I’ve crossed off all avenues. I’ve tried to reset the device, I’ve done everything to be able to use this dang camera. Other than those issues that may be a single defect in the lifespan of this camera the quality and reliability (before this,) were good. Sometimes the camera in the daytime would turn black and white, it did not bother me but the camera quality isn’t top notch and totally clear.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2022"

222,Megan Arce,Love this!,  I came from a baby camera that was video but didn’t connect to my phone or move at all. This was a great step up! Packaging is simple and to the point which I really appreciate. Not hard to remove and no extra parts or packaging getting in the way. I didn’t get it set up on the first try but my husband did. The instructions are very clear. Installation was just two screws and it comes with extra screws which is helpful. The picture is amazing! You can change the sensitivity of motion and noise detection and they’re very accurate. It drains your phone battery a little quick but that’s expected. I went back and forth for a while before buying this and I’m so glad I did it.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2020"
223,Mike s.,Not recommended,"  I got my monitor and it was very frustrating to set up. It goes offline constantly and I can’t get video  until it decides to work again. I first plugged it in about 4 hours ago and my wife has been complaining constantly ever since. Which is only slightly more frustrating than the set up.Aside from this monitor only working when it wants to, my two other issues are 1. If you have it on a shelf a few feet above the crib, the camera doesn’t pan low enough to see anything. It has to be mounted to a wall. 2. If my baby starts crying in the middle of the night, all I get is a notification on my phone instead of real time audio that will wake me up. Like a lot of people, I have my phone set to do not disturb overnight, so I won’t hear the notifications anyway. I know high end monitors can cost a few hundred dollars, so I rated it 2 stars because I realize this is what you get for 40 bucks. I’m sending it back tomorrow. I don’t usually write reviews, but I am now because I wish I knew these details before I ordered it.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 8, 2020"
224,Joyce B.,Terrible headache. Great camera that does NOT record.,"  This product was an unfortunate waste of money. The actual camera works fantastic. You need a subscription which I subscribed to. It was however unrenewed, and impossible to renew making the product worthless. The email support is the only support available and it took a month to get a response to my question. My question was how to renew, since  it was impossible to get into the online account. Everytime I tried to sign in, I had to change my password. When I went to sign in with the new password, it asked me to change it again... the support told me the only way to renew the subscription was to do it online. The phone app does not work, they are aware. In fact, they are getting rid of the app alltogether. Since I couldnt get online I asked to refund / send back, and I was simply told no. All in all, I am stuck with a camera that works great and doesnt record. Will try to sell it on ebay.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2022"
225,PEye2000,Great wifi cam,"  Crystal clear image under both daylight and night vision. The sensitivity of motion detection alert can be adjusted in the app (the most sensitive settings can trigger alert when a small bug flies by). Make sure you have strong and stable Wi-Fi signal at the spot to have smooth video & audio stream.Setup was straight forward and the app was easy to use. I found there are 2 apps in the app store: one is ""nooie"" with blue icon and the other is ""nooie cam"" with grey icon. Both works but the ""nooie cam"" app (the grey icon one) is only for cameras and it is faster, while the nooie app also control other products like smart light bulb under the same brand but video feeds have more delay. Each account can only login to one app on one device at a time.  When you log in on a new device, the old device you previously logged in will be log out automatically.

The tilt on the camera still is lacking but we've learned to work around it. Two way voice and connection issues seem to be resolved now.Original: This gets 3 stars purely because it fulfills its primary purpose of us being able to watch our baby. The night vision works great, and we can hear what’s going on pretty well.What the camera lacks is enough downward tilt to be used close to her crib. In order for it to see our child we have to elevate it a couple feet above the crib and a few feet away.The second downside is the 2 way audio just doesn’t work. There is a huge delay from t the time you talk to the time the camera tried to play what you said, and 90% of the time it comes out garbled and choppy.The app can’t always connect to the camera after it has been set up, and we routinely have to back out and try again.Lastly these things need to be able to use 5ghz wireless.

It cannot turn in a full circle.If mounted on the ceiling it has to be so far away to see the crib that the picture quality is not good.If set on a shelf it still has to be so far away that the picture quality isn't good in order to get a good angle on the baby's face.If mounted horizontally from the wall it can get a good picture of the face and have good picture because it's close enough, but then the camera is panned so far up that you cannot see any other area of the room except a little left and right.All in all I wish I had bought a different product.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2021"

Like the old school one for the baby I only needed it at night to hear her if she woke up. I decided to buy a camera monitor bc I got tired of sneaking in at night. Hoping not to wake her....I always check on my babies before bed. So now I just open the app and watch her sleep! The day/night vision is so clear.The camera moves around the room with ease.Microphone works great! I use the feature at night to help my boys go to sleep. I don’t have to go in there over and over anymore.Okay, so I feel like I almost didn’t buy this bc there a lot of negative reviews. But most were wanting to use this for security. That’s not what this is for...it’s a perfect baby monitor.I am the least tech savvy person. These were an absolute breeze to set up! Download the app plug them in and BAM!I did read the reviews and so I saw where someone said to make sure your WiFi is not 5g or dual lol or something like that? Still have no idea what it means ....so anyway I called ATT to make sure my router was compatible. They even looked up the product for me to be sure.The only negative is my husband can’t log on at the same time. But I still love everything else that is not worth taking a star away for. It’s a $40 camera.You pay for what you get....in this case though it’s really a bang for your buck.I do want to say one more thing. I use this in addition to my baby monitor (the cheap one) bc if she cries at night or is awake I know immediately. Like I said remember the price of the product you are buying.I also use it during the day when she naps and I’m outside with my boys to check on her. It always shows live I have never had a problem with it not...We were just out of town and I got on the app just to see our house and so now I’m going to buy several more for our house.

We borrowed or bought four different cameras. This provided the best image quality and features by far, and surprisingly at the lowest cost. The only down sides are that there are some limits to the range of motion since we mounted ours on the ceiling.  It can't look straight down. Also this is not a good choice for a security camera since it's rather obvious and recording is done on an optional SD card inside the camera.

The motion sensing is pretty good as well. The application runs well on my iPhone. The pan and tilt function is a Slow on the phone but still works fine. I have not tried the motion detection notifications. I will remark that set up of the camera is relatively easy but the camera has to have the code very still to connect properly or it will error.  In other words you have to set the phone on a surface so it doesn’t move at all. It took repeated attempts to set up the camera with the scan code. You have to reset up the camera after firmware updates so this is also very frustrating. For the cost of the item I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend.

At this point why bother having the darn thing. I'm more irritated that because night 1 went so great, I threw the box away. Great! Not to mention it's supposed to notify my phone when a motion is detected. It never has. My husband walks in, in the middle of the night to test it. Not one notification.

256,BR,Great value with full Echo Show integration,  Glad I came across this product as I was about to pay 4x for a fancy baby monitor.  The main 2 attributes I needed were dependable wifi streaming connection and seamless Echo Show integration for continuous monitoring.  From tearing open the package to seeing the video feed on my Echo Show took fewer than 15 minutes.  I tested the video stream fidelity on all of my Echo Shows over the weekend.  The feed ran flawlessly over an 18 hr period.  There’s a 5 second lag but I’m very happy.  Now I need to figure out a stand for the 2nd camera and add an inexpensive fire tablet for flexible baby monitoring throughout my home.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2021"
257,J,Best Night Vision Camera!!,"  I love this camera so much! We were replacing our OG baby monitor due to awful night vision, and were looking for something with an app. I had never heard of the brand, so after reading reviews, we took and chance and are THOROUGHLY impressed with Nooie!!PROS:- Amaaazing night vision! Our night light in the room doesn’t affect the camera (a previous problem), and the black and white coloring doesn’t constantly readjust (if you have an old camera, you know what I mean). This is hands-down the best night vision camera!!- Quick response time!My other worry with an app camera (versus standard monitor and camera) was the response time in opening the app to seeing the room. I’m happy to say this performs well, and I see a clear picture in less than 3 seconds. A plus for first-time moms.- Motion/sound detection is on point! I turned on all of the alert options (crazy first-time-mom-ness), and it easily picks up noises, cries, and movements of our sneaky toddler. It even has a high-medium-low setting for this detection—a feature I love!- Picture on Point! The picture is incredibly clear, even when zooming in. I was worried about the clarity during night vision too, but it’s just as great as day!- Great price!! Since it was on the lower price point, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and features.Cons:- The only thing I would change is vision directly below the camera. We mounted this on the ceiling facing down, so it rotates well to view about 90% of the room. The only spot we’re missing is right under the camera, since it cannot point straight down. It might have a slightly better view mounted in the corner of the room, but this small blind spot for us is not a big deal.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2021"
258,Dana Overland,"Overrated, spend your money for a better brand. O V E R R A T E D.","  The review all says positive things about this camera so I had high expectations. Connection consistency SUCKS. Every time I open the app, I wait for it to open and it would NOT load the camera. Sometimes it would, but most of time it’s spinning and never pops up. It’s just ridiculous, some function I expect out of a $15 camera. I rather spend more and go with a better known brand if I knew the interface and camera connection consistency is like running on a 14.4k server. Just frustrating. Now I am out $50 for this overrated POS and have to spend more money to get something else.The pictures are great WHEN IT WORKS.

259,H. He,Great camera with all the necessary capabilities and a reasonable price,"  When you try to use the mic to talk through the camera, it lags so badly the camera is unusable. Once you turn the mic off, it works normally. I got a second one and it is the same problem. This product is incomplete and I will be returning both.***update- so Nooie customer service reached out and sent me a new camera to try it again. It appears they updated their software because now I am able to speak through the camera without crippling lag on my iPhone. Also I found out there is an option to share the video feed to other users so multiple people can keep watch at the same time. I have tried many baby cams through this whole process, ranging from $300 to $40 and this camera has the best visual quality in daytime and night time.

260,scott a thor,Not the best with iPhone,"  The camera has a sleek look, and the picture quality was great. But the Nooie app is poorly rated on the AppStore…for good reason.I did everything I could possibly do to be able to move the camera using the app to no avail. I even had my husband try with his iPhone. We are both pretty tech savvy, but we simply could not get the camera to move. The camera itself moved just fine when it started up and calibrated, but trying to get it to do what we wanted was a no-go.

261,Stoneyjo,Excellent baby monitor!!!,"  At first I was very cautious about buying this due to the price and comparing it to different baby monitor. After reading numerous reviews I pushed the purchase button. After receiving the nooie I surprised how light it was but looked to be built with durability. It cam with a wall mount and anchors so I can hang it above the crib. Very easy to mount and once plugged in it was very easy to set up to my phone, and very surprised how clear the camera was in day and at night. I was able to share the camera to my wife phone as well (she had to make another nooie account under her email for it to work). I can view my son while he sleeps and I'm at work as well as talk to him through the camera when he's awake.

262,BikerKitty,Save Your Money,"  The camera quality in bright daylight is fine but that's about where the cameras pros end.The camera does not have good range. You cannot see below the camera for a good 4 feet from the wall, not great for a nursery. Maneuvering the screen to get the camera to move is annoying and somewhat difficult.  The quality of photo isn't anything spectacular and in night mode it is worse. It freezes and I have very good wifi. The mic picks up more background noise than anything. Aside from that, the app is terrible. Only one person has access to everything. The camera CONSTANTLY disappears from the added cameras and you have to keep force closing and hope it returns. Sometimes it takes over 5 minutes to pull it up. I paid for the ability to access recorded videos. The playback is terrible and not user friendly. Now, this is the last straw, I was logged out and it is telling me my account doesn't exist. Just started using it for the nursery but am out of my return window so I'm stuck eating the cost.

263,BikerKitty,“Always be there” nooie 360 camera,"  I use this camera in lieu of a baby monitor and it’s perfect for us. The sound and motion detections are both capable of being set to very sensitive so they detect even the slightest sound or movement from baby.Pros:- turn camera on/off easily within the app- clear picture and sound- excellent night vision- take snapshots or record video through the app- motion tracking (I haven’t used this feature yet but I like that it’s available)- adjustable and scheduled motion detection (when set to high sensitivity it can even detect the mist next to it coming from a humidifier)- adjustable and scheduled sound detection- rotate image to hang camera upside down- you can share the camera live feed with another user as long as they have a separate account- you can speak through the camera- 360 feature is amazing, you can move the camera up/down/left/right through the app with ease- ability to zoom in with clear enough images- status light allows you to know whether your camera is on or off- easy setupCons:- if you want to playback footage you need to purchase a monthly subscription to their cloud storage or an SD card- if you bring your camera to a different house you need to reset the camera to use it again- you cannot login to your account on two devices, the app will automatically log you out of one- startup can take longer than 30 seconds- if you leave the camera on consistently the lens area does get very warm (note: this is not an issue when the camera is plugged in and off)Overall, I honestly love this camera. I bought it through an amazon lightning deal, but I would purchase another one full price. I would (and do) recommend this camera to my friends and family. I don’t think you need to be particularly technologically savvy to use this item, but if you are someone who struggles with texting, taking pictures, or using apps on your phone then a virtual camera isn’t for you. Please note that you must have WiFi to use this camera.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2020"

   I've been using this camera as a baby monitor for my daughter, but last week we had to go out of town, I got the Nooir outdoor camera thinking that It was going to work just like this one, so I needed another one to watch my backyard, and since I didn't have time to order another one anymore I decided to use this one. I know that this is not an outdoor camera, but I placed outside my kitchen window, and within 5 minutes of leaving my house my dog got it! (See the video)I was already resigned thinking that it was over for it, and guess what? It still working! Even though my dog played with it as it were a ball nothing happened to it and it still works perfectly fine.I LOVE LOVE LOVE  this camera. I'm saving money because now I want to buy another one for my living room and of course a second nooir outdoor camera 😂I really recommend it.

267,Johnathan,"Low price, low quality, but good customer service","  We’ve had the Nooie 360 for several months now, and overall I’m pretty unsatisfied. The camera has always taken a very very long time to load up the feed, sometimes requiring multiple closing out of the app and reopening. The image quality is just fine, not great. Very slow FPS. I also don’t love that it tries to sell you cloud storage and other products within the app.More recently, as in the last week or two, the camera will randomly just stop working altogether for hours at a time. It displays a message saying your camera is offline, despite no wifi issues with any other device in my home, and the camera itself displaying the white light indicating it’s on and working.I definitely regret going the cheap route. You get what you pay for with this product.UPDATE June 2021:Nooie customer support did reach out to me after I posted my review and they asked me to double check the app I was using and offered three solutions to my poor experience: a full refund, another camera, or another item from their line of products. I went ahead and took the full refund which was processed quickly. Overall I would say the product review remains the same, however I do appreciate the effort and timeliness from their customer service department. Updating to 3 stars for that reason.Also note for future customers - I did notice when double checking my app that in the iOS app store, there are actually TWO different Nooie apps. One is called ""Nooie Cam"", and the other is called ""Nooie"". Both from the Nooie development team. The correct app to use is the one called ""Nooie"".",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2021"

Additionally, if the app is running in the background (like most of the apps do in the smartphones while you are accessing other apps in the phone) and you try to open the app after a while the camera never loads up.

It’s also nice that I can go outside and do yard work while he’s sleeping, and the sound notifications let me know when he wakes up. I turned the motion detection off because the notifications drive me crazy if someone is in the room moving around. The picture is great, sound is not as good as my fancy baby camera, but I don’t need it to be perfect for a toddler’s room. Would be great in a playroom also, or any room you want to be able to keep an eye on. We have it mounted on the ceiling, which is nice...I can pan the camera to see the whole room. We just had to buy a longer cord to mount it on the ceiling, as the one it came with was pretty short. Easy to mount and remove the camera if necessary.

Long story short, it was a terrible user experience.The Nooie, when received and unboxed, had trouble syncing with the app. Maybe it was human error, but was a breeze after I got past that trouble spot. The movement detection can be a bit sensitive, which in turn is a good thing, though I turned it off in the end because it blew up my phone with notifications.

You can listen to the audio the camera picks up on your app but sending audio through the app to the camera is slow and unusable.- As i mentioned in the pros, sound detection notification does not come in consistently.

287,CMathis,A Great Value,"  I bought a Nooie360 about a month ago. I was impressed enough that I bought a second one. We use them to keep and eye on an elderly family member who has fallen, slept in a chair over night, etc.  She is okay with the setup. The Nooie gets a thumbs up on most features. IMO, the thing that needs improvement is the speaker system.  I am soft spoken but my voice comes out quite sharp or harsh. I think it might frighten an infant or young child.

289,Lainee S.,Good for the price,"  The picture quality on this camera is impressive. I wasn’t expecting much for that price. We bought this camera after investing in a horrible and expensive baby monitor that crashed on us at least twice within an hour. This camera was fairly easy to install and you can access it from everywhere. We only connect it during my baby’s nap/bed time or when I leave her at home alone with a sitter, we have never had an issue with it. The only downside of the camera is that it gets very after a while and that the speaker doesn’t work that well when I talk to my little one. Other than that it works great! I will be buying more whenever I am ready to go back to work. It has given me peace of mind the times I have left home without my baby.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2020"

Regular daytime picture and night vision is clear and motion/sound detection alerts are sent to my phone to let us know if they're up and not asleep like they should be. Motion tracking is a little sensitive and sometimes turns itself to the wall even when no one is moving but other than that this is a great camera and has helped solve our issues with kids staying up all night playing in their room instead of going to sleep.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2021"

For example, I am using an iPad as the primary display device for this cam, and I have two additional iPhones connected to it.- The additional phones do not need to be connected to the same wifi. It can access the camera with LTE. I use it outside the home to access the camera without any problem.- Awesome customer service. Very responsive and kind.

293,Mama B.,"Product works okay, app glitchy. Doesn't completely turn off.","  The product works okay in terms of all the advertised functionalities (360, night vision, mic, etc). My issue is with the app, which is glitchy. Sometimes one camera would randomly go offline, and the only way to reset it is to unplug and replug it from the power source. ONE TIME, all my cameras went offline at once for more than 12 hrs and would not come back online even after resetting and replugging. I had to email Nooie customer support and it took another 12 hrs for them to reset it. Another suspicious point is that I always toggle my cameras off at night, but the camera is still warm in the morning. Just to test, I unplugged one camera overnight and touched it again in the morning-- it was much cooler than than the warm camera that was still plugged in but toggled off. So the cameras  don't completely turn off even if you toggle it off in the app, so who knows if it's just idle or continuously recording.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2020"
294,Mama B.,Update ** 5 star to 1 star in a month**,"  Updated my review from 5 star to 1 star!**I loved this baby monitor and raved about it at first! It worked great, about a month after having it it stopped working...while my child was sleeping. We are in the middle of a move and staying with family for a few weeks, so the crib was packed up and we were letting our son nap in the bed with the baby monitor on. I work from home so I had my phone out watching him like usual while I work. Little did I know the baby monitor had froze and our son rolled out of bed. I didnt know until I heard a thump and then him crying and I instantly knew. We took him to the er and he was fine thank god! After coming back and looking at the monitor it now keeps saying network connection error and wont connect, it just wont work. We grabbed the crib out of storage and are sure to use that now. If you buy please dont leave baby or go away hoping you'll see when baby wakes up. Stay within distance to hear them fussing because camera may randomly stop working! **Absolutely love this camera! I got is as a baby monitor. I was expecting something half decent because of the price and I was shocked at how great it was! The video is super clear, you can move the camera by swiping the screen, you can zoom in and even talk through the camera. Night vision is perfect also.

This one had the range I need & it picked up the WiFi right away. Its actually clearer than the Zebora and doesn't drop video like the last two brands did. We have about a second delay from live, but we live in rural Minnesota so that's the internet for you out here. I recommend this one. Im using it in the garage when baby gets older. Set up is easy.

I have to close it and open it multiple times to finally get the camera to load. I find it irritatingly ironic that it freezes on “always be there” and just loads and loads when clicking on the camera to view. It would be faster to go to the nursery and check on my baby 95% of the time, but I have a camera so I don’t have to and accidentally wake the baby if they aren’t up.

One of the things I really like is that the night vision is really clear (a lot better than my Motorola monitor). The camera movement within the app is a bit touchy (I wish there was a way to lock the camera’s movement once you have it set to where you want it) and there seems to be a small lag when you log into the app or switch back to the app (at least for apple iOS), but other than that I have no concerns with this purchase!",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2021"

The camera moves and you have control over it, i find that very cool. I will have to get my boyfriend to put this on the ceiling as my son has a loft bed but that looks like a simple thing for him to do. I think it'll require a drill as it has plastic anchors and screws with a plate that the camera then attaches to. I was hoping to love this monitor as we are planning for a baby in the future, i do like it and think ill be buying a second one soon. I also will probably get an amazon show and the next review for this maybe telling you how it does with the amazon show that it says it works with.

On auto it will switch in the daytime when it is overcast outside, but if this is an issue, you can turn off the auto function.If you do not want to get the cloud storage, you can save live images and video to your phone from the app. That’s what I’ve been doing since I don’t have a memory card, and this is more for me to watch the kitten than for home security.I like the versatility of being able to mount the camera upside down. Initially I didn’t know where I wanted the camera so I plugged the usb into a portable battery pack so I could move the camera around the room while monitoring the images on my phone. I ended up liking the view I got from having the camera in my bookcase. The only thing is that I couldn’t get a good enough look at the floor directly in front of the bookcase from the camera just sitting on the shelf.

324,Michaela,NOOIE360 Baby Monitor Review,"  PROS & CONS:The Good: This product is ideal for a baby monitor. We have it on the edge of our newborn’s crib and use it so we can be out of the room while he sleeps or check him at night without turning on the light. Camera quality is fantastic, and it makes no sound nor emits any light which would startle him. Love it for these things.The Bad: Motion Tracking can be “switched” off, but the toggle turns back on whenever it decides and camera moves to track inanimate motions in the room, when we just want it to stay on the baby. Night Mode can be “switched” to either OFF or AUTO, and frequently turns itself OFF when we need it on in the dark. It will actively do this even while you’re watching the toggle after you just switched it to AUTO. Camera has frequent “Buffering” times, even with quality internet, located close to router.Summary: If you need to check on your little one, and want full room views, get this camera. For constant, live-feed view, without interruption…perhaps…get a better version of this. Not sure if we have defective product or if a “defective company” is at fault here",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2021"
325,Amazon Customer,Great monitor for kids room.,"  Works great. Got as a baby monitor. Baby is not here yet but have it set up in my 3 year olds room to test out. A little slow to load if I have the motion tracking on and there is a lot going on, like multiple kids playing and the dog running around. Understandable though as there is a lot of motion and the camera doesn’t know who to follow. Once I turned that off I stopped having the loading issues. It still tells me there is motion detected and I can go onto the app and turn the camera to track it myself. I can also turn the tracking back on when baby comes and don’t have a million things going on in one room at the same time.

326,Amazon Customer,Terrible!!! Very upset.,"  Honestly, I’m so annoyed that the camera itself is great. The image is clear and the night vision is great too, but the app you have to use for the whole thing is the ABSOLUTE WORST! It takes FOREVER to load up just so you can see anything. since you see everything on your phone, you’re not always going to have it open on your phone while using it for other things, so when you leave the app and come back to it, it takes a lifetime to load it all back up again, which defeats the purpose of us trying to see if our kids are ok, quick, rather then having to run upstairs, but now running upstairs is so much faster then waiting for it to load any video. The lag is insane, you can’t use the speaker well to talk to your kids, and the motion sensor is too sensitive, so if the air moved a curtain the camera moves away from where you have it positioned and it’s super hard to position it back on the app.I wish so badly I could return this and get something that comes with a monitor so we don’t have to use this horrendous app on our phones.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2021"

Left is right, up is down etc… the picture is nice. However it will not work if you have the mic and speaker on. It continues to refresh. Maybe a word comes across. Very irritating. I had a camara from amcrest that works well. Does not have the issues the nooie has. I was trying this one because every time the power goes out, the amcrest will only reconnect by unplugging.

328,D. & B. Perez,Good quality but better features out there,  Overall im happy with the quality of the sound and picture. I dont like how long it take to load/open the camera when I want to see whats going on.Also my neighbor has another brand camera and both her and her husband can both see the camera at the same time; vs this one were my husband and I keep booting each other off when the other person logs on.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2022"
329,Mary,Night vision is extraordinary,"  This cam and its reviews kind of convinced me to take a chance on a no-name company. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the camera and super clear night vision. Getting Alexa Show integration is icing on the cake, because I can watch the baby from the living room using it without my phone.There is one flaw that people should be aware. Notably, the sound on my phone for hearing the cam/baby is very low. It would be ideal to boost this volume somehow within the app or the device. Not a problem when the baby is clearly crying.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2021"
330,Mary,Could be better…,"  Setup with the app was pretty self-explanatory and the picture quality is great. I got this to use as a nursery room camera.A major issue that I’ve had is the delay time in the two-way speaker mode; it often takes up to a minute to register my voice into the room and the camera itself is delayed when using the voice communication rendering that function useless. Another issue is the motion detection and the fact that the camera does not seem to be wireless. It didn’t come with an instruction manual so maybe I’m just missing something, but it turns off when not connected so I don’t see how it could be wireless anyhow. The motion detection is often delayed and/or difficult to adjust when using the app.I wanted to love this camera. It looks minimalistic and has great picture quality compared to others I’ve seen. However, the issues I’ve had plus the delay when connecting to Alexa makes this purchase kind of pointless. I am considering returning and trying a different camera. Oh well.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2021"
331,Deanna,Lags and no consistent audio.,"  The most important feature doesn’t work: audio. Cuts in and out. Microphone is horribly static-y, if it works at all. Video quality is great, if only it were in real time. Used it for a 4 & 5 year old so audio wasn’t as important but it never saved me any trips when I needed to speak to them.

332,T888,Complete Trash,"  I purchased this camera based off the reviews. Upon receiving the camera I was shocked that it came without any instructions. I was left to find the mobile app soley on what I could find online. I contacted customer service after downloading the wrong app. (grey icon) When I down loaded the correct application (blue icon) I was only able to sign into it ONCE. I have tried everything to sign back in. I've deleted the application and re installed it. I've closed out of the app completely and nope!! The mobile app is complete GARBAGE! Camera was decent. Quality was decent. Not able to say much about how easy or simple it was to navigate because I only sign into it once and that was to test it out. This is very frustrating. How good is the camera if I can't access it! If you view the comments in the app store they all say the same thing. Application is trash, it fails to sign you in, ect. Do not waste your time on this. There are better cameras out there with better improved applications.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2021"
333,Nomin G.,Dissatisfied to Satisfied Customer,"  *Update to previous review*Nooie CS contacted us on their own and offered us a replacement camera. We've been using the 360 for a few months now and I'm pleased to say it has been working much better. The connection issue has gone away which was our biggest complaint.Had it two months. (1.)the sound is already not working. (2.)When daylight arrives, the camera can’t decide if it should be night or day vision and it clicks between the two. It wakes us up And it clicks in my sons room as well sometimes waking him up. (3.) Way too many steps to sign in the app.  So if you hear something going on in the room it takes a bit to Login. Only one phone at a time can be logged in. So it’s an extra step to “force” them out. (4.) it constantly loses connection to the Wi-Fi, you have to either physically reset your router or the camera to reconnect. Often This happens in the middle of the night when you’re unaware that it’s been turned (logged) off. When it does reconnect it makes this loud music sound that has also woken up my son. (5.) there’s no temperature gauge on it, A feature I liked on the baby monitors.Here’s what’s good. It’s a clearer picture, and the zoom in feature is nice.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2020"
334,Amanda H.,Great picture quality *UPDATED*,"  Design is sleek and picture quality is great! Setup was quick and easy and I wouldn’t hesitate buying another one for around the house.*UPDATED* Had to take off stars for these reasons which are a big deal for me.1) Cord length is way too short. Even with an extension cord, the cord is too short to mount on the upper half of the wall or ceiling.2) Camera connected and worked great for the first couple days but now it keeps disconnecting and losing the picture and then can't get it back.. Cannot have this as I'm using it for a baby monitor.Updated May 2021-Customer service reached out regarding my concerns with the camera. A resolution was reached and I could not be more satisfied with how attentive they were.

335,Amanda H.,Great product!,"  I ordered this camera because I didn’t want to crate our dog while we were at work. I receive a notification on the app telling me there’s movement and I can easily open the app and watch. There is sometimes a lag when I try to move the camera myself. But it does move on it’s own. The night vision is very clear!! You can record and save, however, we don’t need that. You can also speak through the app. I have not done that because our dog would be very upset if he heard us and we weren’t actually there. (If he gets into my Christmas tree, that will change). The price was great and I am very happy with the product.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2019"
336,Amazon Customer,Fantastic monitor!,  This camera is fantastic. I have a very ill elderly mother and bought it to help monitor when she's out of bed because she's fallen a few times. It was super easy to setup and you can have it monitor for movement or sound and it's alerted me every time she moves. I also love that I can share the camera with other family members. We can speak to her through the app as well.

Having the ability to rotate is a bonus, although its not absolutely necessary, given that it has a very wide angle view.This company has improved their software significantly as well. Its very easy to go back and view the videos stored on your SD card. I noticed that the video playback is a little choppy at times, but that may simply be a limited internet connection that I have at home. Other than that, I'm very impressed  with this camera.This is the second 360 camera I purchase. I previously purchased the regular 720p nooie cam, and this one is by far a lot better.

It wouldn't stream and I was quite frustrated but than I factory reset it and removed it from google home. After resetting it and re-adding it, it now works perfect. The only issue is that sometimes the camera does weird things when watching it through the app on the phone. It will cycle between night vision, standard vision and then black screen at an approx 2 second interval. It is definitely not without flaws but I bought a wyze cam and ezviz and I ended up returning them and keeping the Nooie because for the price and the fact that it is 360 rotation and can use an ad card, the price can't be beat.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2020"

342,Amazon Customer,Great value! Amazing baby/home camera for a fraction of cost.,"  This is NOT a paid review.I bought this product (for our nursery) on lightning deal this week. I placed the order in the morning, and to my surprise the package arrived at 5:30 PM at my door step!PROS:Overall I am extremely impressed with the camera, quality, price, branding, packaging. (I own a few Arlos, and this one gives Arlo a run for their money)1. The app has a wonderful and intuitive user interface (As a professional IT product manager for one of the leading e-commerce companies, I am a sucker for such nuances).2. User experience is also well thought off (e.g.  allows you to format SD card via app, if you chose to store camera feed locally on SD card)3. The camera looks so cute, reminds us of Jeebo (AI robot). Sleek and modern design. Very light.4. The camera feed has a time stamp running. Believe me, with someone who’s home has been broken into, I know the importance of this to add as a corroborative evidence (legally).5. Motion detection (slow/medium/fast options) are smooth and covers our really long living room area.Scope for improvements:1. There are 2 apps from Nooie. Nooie Home and Nooie Cam. I had accidentally downloaded Nooie Home first and signed up for an account. Later realized I should have downloaded Nooie Cam. When I opened the Cam app, my sign in info was not detected by the app. I had to register. It would be nice to have “one app” experience for all Nooie devices and a “single user account/sign in” experience, across all apps.2. Would be nice if Nooie cam detects sound (pan to a space where there is noise) besides just motion3. Electrical cord’s length is about 3-4 ft. Would be nice to have a longer cord if you end up having sockets far away from camera. (Perhaps provide options)We bought this for our nursery. Tested it now. Love it so much, that we ended up using it for our living area. We will definitely buy another one for our nursery.

Being able to sign in on my phone or desktop, tablet is the best and super easy. You can get more then one and switch easily from one to another.

It would go a whole night saying there was no activity. We wound up moving it to another part of the house where we don't need the alerts but just so i can check in and see what baby is up to while I'm at work. When we do use it, sometimes the sound doesn't work and you have to click the microphone to get the sound to play, most recently it's not giving me any sound just audio. I definitely wouldn't recommend this for overnight usage, i wound up buying the Nanit (i do not regret it at all)",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2021"

I can move the camera and zoom using the app. That being said, I wish that I had noticed that it didn't come with it's own monitor. It was marketed as a baby cam, so I assumed it had a monitor. I have to use an app on my phone to monitor the baby at night, which means my phone stays plugged in and turned on (with a bright screen) in my bedroom all night.

It connects to wireless router and is seamless - no bugs or issues. They are constantly doing updates and the app downloaded from apple store is very easy to use and I have had zero problems with it. The motion and sound detection is flawless - perhaps a little too sensitive at times but I sort of wanted that what with me being hyper-sensitive about my baby's care. Great product.

348,Dr. A,Decent,  First one came and didn't work. Unit kept disconnecting throughout the day. They sent a pretty quick replacement which works as intended. For the price this cost it works pretty good. The major downfall on the design is needs to be mounted high up out of reach of toddlers. Unit will be unplugged regularly if not. When installed at a higher elevation product will not be able to get a good view of the entire space. Camera rotation needs to be improved upon. Quality is ok. i would say 98  percent of the time it is in night vision whether it is day or night. Almost needs to be a set up function to se able to set the hours you would like it off of night vision. Quality is much better when is day mode.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2022"

It’s strange because I still will periodically get notifications letting me know that motion or sound has been detected in the room however I cannot view any video, it’s stuck on the black nooie welcome screen. I’ve tried disconnecting and reconnecting, restarting the app, and restarting my phone - nothing works.

350,A Gross,Everything doesn’t work anymore,  This worked perfectly… for 3 months. Now the app crashes often which means I’ll wake up to my phone or iPad on the Home Screen and hearing my baby crying from across the house. The sound detection feature inexplicably stopped working a month ago. If the app won’t stay oven over night and it won’t notify me when the baby is making noise then what is the point of this camera!?? Such a waste and now I can’t sleep because the stupid app can’t do the basic thing it needs to do! Also the app is super finicky when adjusting the direction of the camera. And accidental touch of the screen in the app will send the camera pointing clear across the other side of the room!

351,SKM,Only works with 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi,  Wasted hours of my time trying to get this camera to work. I was impressed with all the high reviews on Amazon and very disappointed when I downloaded that app to see that it has horrible ratings. Despite that I tried it anyway and realized after trying to get it to connect and read the QR code that it only works if you set it up on its own Wi-Fi connection to 2.4 GHz. Almost all routers these days are either 5GHz or a combination of 2.4 and 5. Mine is a combination and it still doesn’t work unless I separate them into 2 separate accounts which all internet service providers don’t recommend because it will make your internet connection worse.

I know the camera won’t connect with weak internet but it’s hard to believe that everyone we know has weak internet.

But I don't think anyone actually tested it before using it. When we *finally* got it to connect to our fiber wifi (so many issues there), we decided to test it. Turns out, the delay is so bad that it's silly to think it would be used for your baby. There was at least a 30 second delay from the video cam to the feed. Not great if you are trying to listen for crying. We also could not get the sound/motion detection to work.It's a fine video camera (we kept it for a security cam) but definitely no good as a baby cam.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2021"

The only minor complaint is that sometimes the screen goes completely dark during the night vision and I cant see her for a while but it doesn't happen often and it goes away on its own.MY husband did notice that our box came without the wall mount and Amazon said they couldn't help us so when we contacted the company directly, they immediately said they would send us the missing pieces.

So far I love it! You can set times for every day of the week where you want the nooie 360 to sense motion and sound and automatically start filming and tracking the moving object. Also the quality seems great! I'm even able to see my face from 10 feet away with the sun shining behind me. Without the sun blaring I'm able to see my facial features up to 20 feet away in daylight.

367,Cm575,Good for home. TERRIBLE for travel.,"  Picture Quality is awesome. If you’re using it for your home camera, it’s probably great. We wanted to use it for travel only, which I would definitely NOT recommend. We loved the idea of being able to see the kids while we’re out and about and the kids are with a babysitter, but it’s terrible for traveling. Setting it up is a PAIN. It setup easier at my parents house, but when when we took it to my in-laws I could only get one to work and it took me over an hour to get that one to work. It was on 2G network, I checked everything in their troubleshooting, and reset it a million times. I was so frustrated with them it ruined my first night of vacation. The same thing happened when I took them to my sister in laws house. I think one of them was defective...I only got it to work one time and never again. The one that did work, again took many attempts to setup and is just really frustrating. It’s so much easier to use a camera that is just plug and play and does not connect to the internet. It didn’t work in their basement bedroom, which was where one of our kids was staying. So, if you’re using it for home, it’s probably great, but do NOT get it for traveling.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2019"
368,Dijon Moore,"Great product, especially for the price!",  We used this as our travel monitor while visiting my parents and I was so impressed!

370,Animal Lover,Amazing quality and price!,  I had an expensive $170 Owlet camera that  I received on my baby shower and I had to return it because there were apps glitches all the time. The signal was not very good and the sound was not working.I’ve done a lot of research and found Nooie camera. I absolutely love it! I didn’t experience any disturbance with it. I find amazing price/ quality ratio too !  The camera is very good and you can zoom in and out AND the most important thing for me is that you can manually move it in all directions. So if the baby is moving around the room you can easily follow. Very impressed of the night vision camera quality too and it has the option to switch off the white light and so the baby will not wake up. You or your baby will not notice the camera is ‘watching’ your baby during night time. Excellent product !

371,KiddoKidder,Top notch WiFi camera,"  Excellent HD camera with multiple uses. Currently used as a baby monitor with the phone app which allows you to view live feed, record video, or take a picture. Using the app, the camera can rotate and tilt enabling a complete view of the room.The camera has great resolution and night vision capability. The app will send a notification to your phone based on noise and/or motion detection. The camera can also follow motion in the room tracking movement. A bonus feature is the ability to turn off the LED power light indicator on the unit as to not shine the light on the baby.WiFi connectivity is stable unlike traditional baby camera/monitor combos that would beep and wake everyone up when it lost a signal connection between camera and monitor.

375,Madge LaRue,Nooie,"  We got this to use as a baby monitor. Initial set up was somewhat difficult, only because once I paired the monitor to the app, it asked me to update the firmware. After the update, it failed to pair. So I had to reboot the monitor and start over again.Otherwise, the camera works well. Picture quality is nice. The tilt and zoom options are great. I like that it includes the wall mount. The motion and noise detection seems a bit sensitive for now but we’ve only had it for a few hours so hard to tell.Love the design!

376,Lizzie B.,Can’t hear when your baby cries,"  For anyone wanting to use this as a baby monitor, this only sends you notifications to your phone when it detects a noise. You have to open the app to actually hear if your baby is crying. I like to constantly be able to hear my son in his bedroom so if he starts to cry right away, I can go and get him. But with this device, I’m afraid I will sleep through the notification and not hear him when he needs me. We decided to not return this product and instead use it as a front door security camera.

378,Rebekah Radney,More trouble than it's worth,"  At first this camera was great, but we've slowly had more and more problems with them. To start with it stopped connecting to our Amazon show (which was the only reason we bought an Amazon show). Fine, we dealt with it but even after reaching out to customer support we had no options given to us to fix this. Now, we bout an SD card. Started off fine... but guess what: it no longer registers the SD card. We've reformatted it both in the camera (which now says there's no SD card in the camera even though there is) and on the computer with the format they've recommended. Still nothing. If you want to look back at the details of an event it looks like you'll have to spend upwards of 30 dollars a month to see. The only reason this isn't a one star review is because the camera works... just not as good as they're saying.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2021"
379,Kayce,RV cam,  I added this cam to our RV so I can keep an eye and ear on our dogs when we are away. This works great. I did notice that when we change wifi networks (when moving to different campgrounds) we needed to delete the camera from the app and reset the camera to connect to the new network.

Needless to say, I ripped it out of the wall and smashed it into a million pieces. This ruined the wi-fi camera monitor trust for me. Never again.

387,Jessely,"Awesone camera and with a few tweeks, it'd be super-awesome!","  I do not normally leave reviews, but I really like this product! The picture is great, both daytime and night time. The audio and speaker functions work great and it is super quiet even when rotating. For the price, it's got to be the best out there! The app is very easy to use and set up was a breeze, it also looks cute and I've named mine ""Eve"" from Wall-E, you'll see why. :) Ps. I know that this is advertised as a baby monitor, which it would work great as due to its quietness, but I use it for an indoor home ""security"" camera. I'll probably get another to put in my Ferret's room to see what they are up to as I think, like the other reviewers have said, since the motion works so well it's great for watching your fur-family while you aren't home.I have noticed, though, that it doesn't rotate a full 360° around, more like point A to point B then from B back to A but not A to A, if that makes sense. So, if sitting on something I am not sure if it would catch a person walking behind it where the void, albeit small void, is as it has no way to ""track"" past that stopping point unless it goes back to the the other side which I have not seen it do yet.Although I give it 5 stars, here are a few recommendations for the developers:- Make the directional control to be more like a video game up, down, right, left control as opposed to the screen drag controls. I think this will result in more user control and less covering of the screen/image with fingers.- Either make the plug in port, on the camera, higher or provide a plug in that points straight out. The current port of the base on the plug that goes into the camera makes it a little difficult to sit flat without bending the cord, although the existing cord does fit well and looks nice.- The length of the supplied power cord is not really adequate to be placed on the ceiling, higher up on the wall or higher up on a piece of furniture. Maybe think of an option for a cord free option with rechargeable battery pack? I realize this would probably make the entire unit bigger. Or a USB extension for higher up applications.Other than that, I think it is a solid camera and again, for the price, it works great. I will definately be getting another one and am looking at their outdoor camera as well!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2020"
388,Dwayne,You get what you pay for,"  UPDATE A YEAR LATER- Camera itself is fine, but software is total garbage and doesn't work, rendering the camera useless for security purposes.  I'm literally walking around in front of the camera now and no alerts are occurring.  It seems that nowadays when you turn the alerts off (if you will be around in front of the cameras, thus triggering them) and later turn them back on when you are away,  they just never start working again.Updating the rating because the company replaced the camera and seems to be working at improving their product.EDIT: Removing a star because in the few days I have written this review, the audio on the camera stopped working.  This camera is less than six months old!!If you need good security, just spend the money on the main competitor that is more expensive but much more reliable.  I regret not doing that now.  The app is inconsistent, the alerts are hit or miss, and we had a burglary attempt AND a full enclosed trailer stolen , NO alerts.  By the time we discovered the illegal activity, any evidence was gone from my cloud storage.  As I am writing this review, there is a family member inside the residence covered by the cameras and has been in front of the outside camera as well - you guessed it, no alerts.

The set up instructions were simple however it took multiple attempts to connect to Wifi with little direction on how to problem solve. Once I got it initially set up the original shelf I had it on was too close and only allowed for vision of half the crib. I unplugged and moved the monitor and it made me go through the set up process all over again. It also has a delay to it, sometimes even showing it’s loading sign instead of a picture. I need a monitor to keep up so I know what’s going on with my infant at that moment. I also tried testing it again later and after 5 minutes of it trying to load an image I gave up.

398,Nitin,Excelente camera for a fair price,  I got this camera with 20% off so it came just a tab above $40 w/ tax. It is a great camera for these few days that I had it.I have seen some complaints about the setup process and security. For the initial setup the camera read the QR code right away and prompted me to updated it.After the update it says that you need to factory reset the camera to continue using. I tried without doing it so and it kept me locked on the white solid light. So you need to grab a thin paper clip and reset it. Then it connects without any issue.About security I enabled two-factor-authentication within the app. So for someone to connect to my camera would need a code that’s sent to my email. Now if this is a concern to you I suggest looking for offline solutions as I don’t thing they come more secure than what Nooie offers with 2FA. Just remember to secure it with a nice password. I suggest using Last Pass’ generator to create random stuff.The image is good for a 1080p camera and it follows you like crazy. I have to put some google eyes just to make it more easy to have something following you left and right. You can also program the time in which the camera looks for motion and sound. Haven’t noticed any lag with the feed also.The main issue that I have is the mounting situation. They offer you a wall mount that you can screw but that’s it. If only they had a tripod mount too it would be perfect. Now you have folks who have designed mounts on Thingverse.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2021"

Can't get it to pair anymore. When it did pair the video cut in and out and sometimes frooze the video feed completely so it looked like she was sleeping but it was just frozen. I also couldn't get the sound to work on multiple occassions. Which probably means sometimes my poor baby would be crying and we couldn't hear her which breaks my heart.

402,Angel Santiago,"This is a cheap camera, that mostly works, if what you care about is cheap.","  This was a constant source of frustration because it did not behave consistently.  If it never worked, we would have thrown it out and bought a different camera within a week of our son being born.  But it worked.  Most of the time.  The camera's interaction with our wifi was consistently terrible, it was buffering (or whatever you call the little spinning Nooie icon when video isn't streaming) probably every 10 seconds.  I don't know if that is the camera's fault or our network's fault, but it is under 40 feet from our router, and considering none of our other devices have any issues I can only assume it is the camera. And it would eventually catch up and push through the sound to let us know when the baby woke up within 30 or 60 seconds.  The reason I decided to finally post this review is that three times within the past month, I have turned on the app, the camera was working properly, I went to sleep, and when I woke up I was getting no video transmission at all, just a constant spinning Nooie icon.  Each time, I rebooted the Nooie app, and it told me that my camera was off.  If I went into the baby room, unplugged and then replugged the camera, the camera reappeared in the app, but at this point I can't trust this to consistently stay online, so I am back sleeping in the family room where I can hear the baby for the next three  or four days until the new camera we ordered arrives.If you absolutely can't afford anything better, this mostly works, but I would not recommend it.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2020"

The process of connecting the camera to Wi-Fi with nooie app is user friendly and easy. Picture quality is satisfying and night vision is good. The price for this camera is excellent compared to other cameras in the market.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2019"
407,Lydia W.,Camera becomes extremely hot!!!!!,  Very dissatisfied with this monitor! Last night while putting my son to sleep I happened to brush up against the camera and it felt so hot I thought it had burned me. After unplugging the monitor I had let it cool off and rebooted it in my well lit kitchen and only the day time camera portion worked. I left the camera plugged in for an additional few minutes and the camera became extremely hot again. I am unsure if the camera is faulty but as hot as this camera got I am truly afraid it could have burned my baby or my home down. I am very unhappy as I have only had this camera little over six months and it has already burned out. Would definitely not recommend this!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2020"
408,J & K,Does the job,  I've had this product already for maybe 3 to 2 months. I like that it was inexpensive and does the job. The picture quality is better then my 7 year old Nokia monitor. The app gives you the option to set it to alert you if there is motion or noise. We usually put it when maybe is sleeping. I have notice that sometimes it does alert you right away and many times where it has a delay. It also has a delay when connecting to the camera away from wifi reach. It has a very loud reboot sound when turning it on. Overall is good does the job.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2020"

410,SJS,Good with 1 issue,"  Picture quality is very good unless you zoom in. The zoom is a digital zoom not a lens zoom so the image will become more grainy as you zoom in.

417,User,"Great Cam. The 360° rotation is great, though controlling the rotation could be better.","  Works great, looks cool. Subscription service is reasonable. App is simple and easy to setup and connect. I use the camera rotation a lot.My only complaint is that manually rotating the camera (the best part about this camera) through the app is way more difficult than it should be. Swiping your finger is inaccurate. I never know if the camera is going to move a little, a lot OR just keep spinning nonstop until it's looking completely backwards. This could be due to latency between mobile phone connection.My suggestion is that rotating the camera should be done with buttons. A compass system would work too, where 0° is straight forward, and I can adjust that number to rotate. ...or a mixture of both.ANYTHING but this inaccurate and arbitrary finger swiping system and it's easily 5 stars.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2019"

I personally liked that it notifies you for every sound or motion, whether it be the baby or not. It’s brought me a sense of relief knowing that if anything were to happen I would be notified within a second. Especially since everything is sent to my phone directly. It also helps that my fiancé and I can both see and receive notifications from our own phone.

426,cb,Not reliable,"  Don’t recommend this product! Please don’t buy.This Nooie camera is a hassle. I’ve had this camera for about a year now and it’s not reliable. It seems every two months, the camera is disconnected from the app and it has to be setup again. For example, I used the app/camera at night then in the morning, I open the app and it says I have to connect a camera. It’s as if there was no camera connected even though I had just used it the night before. And the setup process might look simple but it has major flaws. First of all, the app requires to use an internet connection of 2.4G and not the standard 5G. The steps to setting it up seem simple: plug in the camera, connect to the internet, then it SHOULD work. But it doesn’t! Then there’s help instructions, which basically says to unplug then plug it back in and that should fix the problem. But it doesn’t! It’s just frustrating.Also, the picture quality is okay. But the night vision option isn’t reliable either. There has been numerous times when all of a sudden the camera goes black and nothing has changed in the room. Then it might decide to fix itself in 10-20 mins or sometimes the app has to be closed and opened again or the camera has to be set up again.

The app settings are simple and easy to understand. I appreciate the ability to loop storage space on an SD card.

Anytime I tried to rotate the camera, at best it would take 3-5 seconds or not rotate at all. I also tried the microphone and it worked 1 out of ~10 times I’ve tried to speak through it. I tried to enable the sound detection but it would disable by itself when I exited and re-entered the app. All those things could result from a slow WiFi, but my Roku has no issues streaming on the same network so I don’t think that’s the cause.

451,phenom,Basically garbage at this point.,"  This thing is frustratingly inconsistent. Setup was a pain and the app is very buggy. Once I did get it set up, I had to switch locations for the camera. After that, I've been unable to get it to work well. Even though I got the device paired initially, it now insists that it's offline no matter what I do. I've done factory resets and re-pairs over and over trying to get it to work, and it's just useless at this point.

I do like that I can view the baby directly from my phone using the app. Movement is pretty accurate. Barely noticeable delay on screen. There are a few things I wish were different...The app... You constantly get logged off when sign onto multiple devices.There’s no off button on the cameras... so I have to constantly log back onto the app and turn it off.When using the microphone to speak to the baby, it sends your voice in a delay.That’s all.

Wait until your kid is a decent sleeper and/or you aren't an overly paranoid parent.Picture quality and motion/noise detection are great. Love being able to move the screen position and zoom in and out. BUT...Not my favorite mode of baby monitoring at night time unless you are a super sensitive sleeper and your phone notifications will wake you UP. Even if you have the app open and have the room pulled up,the volume is very low and hard to hear.Love that it syncs with Alexa devices. But it does not ""work""/pull  the first time you ask alexa to show the baby room EVERY TIME. And it also randomly turna off in the middle of the night.

I can hear the audio just fine from the camera end but when I talk on my phone to the camera, it cuts out and is muffled. I’m disappointed in this camera because all of the reviews say it’s good. Working audio is a must for me. It’s got to work on both ends. I wish I woulda stuck with what I knew worked, the Samsung Smart Cam.

I looked over and he moved his leg, literally.  I love how this captures the slightest movement when set on high because now that baby is rolling onto his stomach to sleep, this mama is scared to death and I need to have eyes on him every minute.

I use it as a monitor is my kids' room and it's easy to pan around to see the whole room.One thing I hate though and it's making me wonder if I should get a different camera is that if power goes out or you unplug it to move it, you have to reset the entire camera. This means pressing the reset button and completely redoing the set up every single time something happens to the connection. Our power went out for a few minutes and now I can't see my kids, which defeats the purpose of this camera.If it could reconnect once power came back on then it would be great for my needs.

Sure if you setup alarms it will give you lots of false positives but I have tried other cameras and they share the same flaw even the expensive competitor has the same flaw. I don’t use motion tracking however being able to move the camera makes it super useful and I will be installing a second one since I’m so impressed.

468,kcrawley,Nooie Cam 360 exceeded my expectations!,"  My wife asked me to research and buy the best baby-cam, so of course I assumed the most expensive one and biggest one with the reputable electronics name would be the best. It was 6 times as expensive, bulky, terrible user experience on the product and app, and didn't do some of the things this Nooie does right out of the box.When I received the Nooie, the first thing you notice is the quality packaging. As an industrial designer, I was pleasantly surprised with the overall design of both the packaging and the product itself. The product doesn't feel cheap at all, sturdy construction, fine crafting, and quality materials. The App is no nonsense simplicity, even setting it up was super-easy. I shared the camera with my wife, and boom she has it. I love that it uses euro-time 0-24 hr to set motion and sound detect timers, which are easily configurable. Push alerts on the phone are great, and the Nooie makes no noise but follows motion around intelligently.If there was one thing I would have liked, it only came with one wall hanger piece. Would have been nice had it come with two, so you can move your Nooie from one wall to the next with ease.One of the best bang for the buck products I have ever bought on Amazon, and very pleased to submit this glowing review.

It detects the smallest motion and smallest sounds even when you set it to low, which is great for a baby cam! My only complaints are that I wish the sound would stay on in the background instead of just getting an alert, plus the alert is the same tone as my text tone and I can’t change it. The other issue is it’s a little time consuming to set up but also pretty self explanatory. We recently took it out of town and I had to delete the camera and reset the camera itself in order to use it, instead of just being able to change the wifi network. Other than that it’s a great camera! Barely makes any noise when it turns, so it doesn’t wake the baby!",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2020"

472,BlackBerry,Long Load/Buffer Times!,  I wanted to like this camera for a baby monitor…but I don’t. My biggest issue is how long it takes to load the picture from the app. Every time you leave the app and return it is at least 30 secs to buffer. There’s also no sound when you leave the app (my Hatch can even do that!). Then it often loses connection. It tried buffering for three hours last night and the only way to correct it was to shut everything down and reload. We thought maybe it was our internet but we aren’t having any difficulty with any other devices including our replacement monitor we bought today. It’s got pretty good image quality but poor sound.

The night vision is better than some other cameras I have tried when I couldn’t actually tell if her eyes were open or not! I can clearly see lots of detail with this camera. The only downside I’ve noticed is that moving it can be laggy. That doesn’t really take away from it being a really good camera.

A friend across town can also monitor the kitten on her smart phone, with the free Nooie app.  I had thought that ""wireless"" meant cordless, but I was mistaken.  It needs to be plugged in.

The only downside was in light the night vision mode would constantly flicker on and off waking up my baby if I didn't wake up in time to turn it off.Other than that last night around 2am (over 4 hours of camera being on and untouched while baby was asleep) I believe my camera was hacked as it started moving on it's own. It moved strangely at first, like looking around the room. After entering the nursery nothing happened. I looked directly into the cam then moved. Nothing happened. A few seconds later the camera turned toward me. I moved where my face wasn't completely visible, it moved to see my whole face. A few seconds later it moved back to my sleeping baby who was completely still. Then back to me. Wanted to contact nooie about it, but they just have janky emails and no numbers.

I admire this camera also due to the fact that I can view the camera from home while I'm at work which is great! I just can't get over how clear the picture is. Well made!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2020"

496,C.D ,"High quality, feature and finish at a really good price!","  This is my second Nooie Cam in as many days. Loved the first, had to buy the second. Setup was a breeze like the first, less than 5 minutes. Picture quality is true 1080p. It really does track motion with great accuracy. No lag in the time it detects motion to the time the alert is sent to my phone. My dogs don’t know what to make of it! 🤣 Being able to talk to them and see their reaction is worth it alone in entertainment value. Excellent alternative to expensive alarm systems and other video monitoring platforms. Might have to pick up the outdoor cam next. Love the look and design. Very clean. I’m a huge fan of the Nooie Cam line!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2019"
497,karen,Great camera for the price,"  Using this in our baby room, it works as expected and at a great price. Came as advertised and works well. Would recommend to anyone looking for an affordable camera.Pros- price- easy to setup, had it on my network, streaming video to my phone in less than 5 minutes- IR and image/video quality are good (except when zoomed - see below)Cons- App doesn't have many customization options, 3 levels of ""motion"" or ""noise"" sensitivity, lowest setting is still a little sensitive, users you share the camera with are unable to adjust these settings for their own account.- Would like to see a wifi only mode instead of interacting with the cloud, dont really need cloud access in my case.- Zoom quality isnt great. looks like the camera itself doesnt zoom, just zooms the image on your phone which results in poor image quality and really low FPS- Would have liked better alerting options built into the app instead of making so many adjustments to my phone. for example, I leave my phone on silent/vibrate, it would be nice if this app could override volume options and always plays a noise when motion/sound is detected. Although to be fair this is likely more of a phone limitation than app.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2020"
498,Ladaga,BEST baby monitor ever!!,  8 months ago I had my second child and we've been on the hunt for a good quality baby monitor or baby camera.  We finally found it!!!  The quality and convenience is what makes this product so great.  I simply login on my phone or any other device and I have immediate access to see what my baby is doing and to ensure that she is okay.  The Nooie 360 is a must if you want and need to view the entire perimeter of the room.

499,Peter Martinez-Remarachin,"So far, so good!","  Just received this monitor today. It has a very sleek design, and is pretty aesthetically pleasing in my opinion. I was able to set it up on my iPhone 8 without any major problems, and it seems to be working well so far. Holding the QR code in front of the camera was a little tricky, I kept holding it too close, but once I figured that out it was fine. The little booklet has some pretty straightforward directions and a guide for the light indicator so you should be able to figure out pretty easily what the problem is, if any. I’m wondering if the issue some people have is that it will only connect to a 2.4 gig wireless network. Upon successfully connecting, the video quality is great, it doesn’t seem to have much of a delay, and you can pan and zoom which is nice. In the app you have the option to mute sound, take a photo or record video to your device, and turn the camera off. Overall I’m pretty pleased so far with all of the features that it has, especially for the price. I will update my review once I have used it for a few weeks.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2020"

The live video feed that I got from my phone was really clear. The audio does not pick up a lot of static noise from the surrounding area. The camera rotates smoothly and precisely.Overall, it seems the hardware is built well, however, the main issue I have is the product's app.I was not able to reconnect to the camera after I closed the app. For reference, I used both android and apple iOS and neither of the phones managed to reconnect to the camera.  Whenever I open the app to check the live feed camera, it just keeps me on the loop of the loading screen.I am currently in the process of returning the product as it does not meet my expectations.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2021"

505,Miss D,"Great camera, but a few flaws.","  I really like this camera but couldn't give it 5 stars because there are a few flaws. Let me start by saying that I am mainly using this camera as a baby monitor so this review is based on that use. The biggest flaw for me is that the sound comes out of the phone ear piece instead of the phone speaker making it very hard to hear without putting your phone to your ear. Can we get an update to change this? (I am using a Samsung Galaxy S8 Active phone.)The second biggest problem is that you cannot listen in while using another app. As soon as you change apps or turn your phone screen off the listening feature turns off. My previous monitor I could turn off the screen or use another app and still listen in to the baby room.There is a delay in the camera motion when moving it from your phone screen and we did have a little trouble getting the camera to connect to our wifi, but it eventually worked.This is a great camera otherwise. The picture quality is great (day and night vision) and motion detection is pretty accurate. I love being able to remotely connect so that I can check in when away from the house.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2019"
506,marcus washington,Frustrating set up and too many problems,"  It is difficult to set up. The view is limited (can’t look up or down past a certain point). The mic and speaker are low quality (can’t communicate via the camera). One of the most frustrating things is how often it requires an update, at which point the only way to connect is to reset to factory settings and go through the initial set-up all over again (which can only be done if you’re sitting with the camera; so good luck if you leave for vacation during one of these episodes). Sometimes it will refresh/think repeatedly without showing the camera feed, even though it’s sitting right next to the Internet router. I was initially pleased with the purchase, but quickly became disappointed. I plan to replace both cameras with a different brand.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 16, 2021"

The biggest is that the auto nightvision is somewhat erratic - it will often decide it's light enough and turn off the IR light, making everything totally dark until it realizes its mistake a few seconds later and turns it back on. The app could be a bit faster to connect to the camera and start showing the live feed as well.

First photo is night vision off, second photo with it on.Set up took about 20 minutes due to a firmware update, plus a very slow initial connection.

It’s really not usable anyways because you can only hear audio when the app is open on your phone. The second your phone locks the audio is gone. How is that a monitor?

Not something I can say for the apps supporting the other cameras.3. Sensitive motion and sound detection.  Picks up small movements or sounds other cameras fail to catch4. Quiet motion.

However it's easy enough to reset and you can tell when it's stuck by checking the time in the corner.If you plan to use it as a baby monitor, as I was, it's useful to have a dedicated viewing device other than your phone, say an iPad or the like. Haven't had any problem with the detection, just make sure you have your notifications set to alert you in case you need to be woken. Overall can't find picture quality like this in traditional baby monitors which I find useful when looking for those tiny signs of breathing.It can take a few seconds to load so be mindful of that as well. If you're looking for instant, constant monitoring of a young baby you may want a more traditional monitor that takes a dip in picture quality for more consistency and no need to worry about your connection.Overall very pleased with the product and happy that it will find use beyond being a monitor once we no longer need it for the baby.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2019"

I like how easily I can open the app and look at the live footage of the camera and the quality of the picture is clear.Some pros:The camera is easy to install. Just download app and follow the few steps it asks.The camera has recording feature either on a disk on the cloud or on the phone which is nice to have those features.The quality of the picture is clear.The night vision is great especially in small rooms like a bedroom.The camera is quiet when it turns to follow to motion.The motion detector is accurate to a decent distance which the sensitivity can be controlled.The audible detection is a nice feature which as well is pretty sensitive and can control sensitivity.Comes with a mount if you want to place up on ceiling to make it more hidden (unless you have bright vibrant colored walls or ceiling).You can simply move camera to different parts of the house.You can speak into the camera to ward off criminals and also just to say friendly hello to your fur babies or children.The pano of the camera is a decent width to where I can almost see the entire 11X10 room.Cons:The power supply is a simple three foot power cord which can be unplugged and therefore turn off camera. Would be nice to have internal battery source as backup.The camera is a size in which you can’t really hide.The camera only works if your internet is 2.4g thus if your internet is 5.0g it will not be compatible. You could have dual band so just check with your internet company.The motion detector only follows one item thus a second person can sneak past the camera.If camera is sitting on desk height you won’t be able to see what’s beneath it up to about three feet (if placed on ceiling you have better angle).I got this as a gift from family because I got a puppy and it is awesome to watch her in her play pen while I’m at work and I can speak to her through the camera. For the price of this camera you can’t beat it. Good picture quality and good live feed connection and easy installation. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do and hope this review helps.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2019"
540,Arek Kosinski,"Easy set up, decent camera. Satisfied customer",  I've had this camera for exactly 1 day. Set up was easy and only took a few minutes with my Samsung galaxy (my daughter has an iPhone and it wasn't as easy for her but it wasn't terribly difficult).I bought this to watch my pets from work and it's oddly satisfying. So far it works really well.Motion detection is snappy but physically moving the camera from the app to see something specific is slow and arduous.Picture quality is pretty decent but it does blur with motion and there is some pixelation. The video is crisp and clear otherwise both daytime and with night vision. I am happy with my purchase.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2019"

Very nice!",  I've got to amend my review because Nooie support has addressed all my concerns and much more.I had no setup problems at all. Very quick and very impressive. The support people addressed sound. I realized how to aim camera to avoid glass glare and night vision works fine.This little camera and this company rock. Very nice people to work with.  Not like Guardzilla who just disappeared!Thanks everyone.....Night vision not great for me because it involves a window.  Sound is nonexistent for me just on monitoring.  Haven't actually had anyone close to talk with yet. I had 3 Guardzilla cameras that worked great until first of the year and then stopped. No one at company is responding to customers.

Gotta get out of bed to go unplug and plug back in again. ** Make sure to turn the startup noise off **I will say, when it works, the picture quality is great.

They do have cloud storage if you choose but are not forced to use. Great camera and great price. Thank you.UPDATE: I bought this camera hoping it would work with alexa( as advertised), it does not.

What we loved is how easy it was to set up, and how smooth and beautiful the camera itself was. You can MOVE the camera with your phone to see the room. That blew my mind. The product was only like 30 bucks and I can move the camera and see the room in 360 view?? Wow. My old baby monitor was 100$+ and it was the equivalent of a Nokia lol. So anyways, The picture is very clear & so is the audio. The night vision is great and you can even zoom in to see your little one up close! You get notifications when there is motion or sound detected so you don’t have to watch the cam 24/7 if you don’t want. But if you do, you can set it up full screen on an ipad or something. Super cool. I want one for my living room too.

587,James,Best Baby Monitor!,"  Our expensive baby monitor (that we purchased 4 years ago for our first baby) finally decided to crap out.  I read lots of reviews and was trying to decide which monitor I wanted to go with, but really didn't want to spend $100+. I stumbled upon this while searching through Amazon and decided to give it a try.  If it sucked, I wouldn't be out too much $.  This camera is SO much better than the $150 camera that we had previously had.  Picture quality is great, we can view directly from our phones (from anywhere), and take pictures or videos of the footage. I would recommend this to anyone who is in the market for a baby monitor.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2020"

Camera does support micro SF card up to 128GB. Micro SD card slot is on the camera ball. You have to use the app and move the camera view straight up as far as it can go and there’s a little slot for the card. Could not find instructions for SD card from Nooie anywhere.

594,Zzzzz.,Convenience,  This camera is nothing shorter than AMAZING!! I purchased it to use as a baby monitor if I'm in a different room than my newborn baby and he's sleeping. I downloaded the app to my wife phone and my phone so we could both have access to the camera. The quality of the picture/video is great. The motion detection feature is also another great feature. I am also able to hear what's going on in thw room through the integrated microphone and also able to speak through my app to the camera. This is by far one of the BEST purchases I've made for my baby. Already plan on purchasing additional Nooie cameras. Also they give you options to purchase cloud storage that let you play back recordings up to 30 days or insert a SD memory card which is another great feature.

595,Kountry Phoenix,Toddler mom approved,  I’m using this to monitor my 1 & a half year old that we’ve just transitioned from a crib to a toddler bed to make sure she doesn’t get up & play. Night vision is great - shows great picture. Motion detector is great as well. I have the notifications on & when motion is detected I get an alert on my iPhone. Set up was also very easy. I also like that you can move the camera view to “look around the room”. The only drawback for me personally is that it takes at least a minute to open up the app & view the live video - I’m not sure if that has anything to do with the product though. Also I can share account information with my husband so that he can also see our baby using the app on his phone.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2020"

600,Amazon Customer,Best baby monitor for a great price!!!,"  I was very skeptical when I purchased this because of the price.  ""It probably won't be great because it's only $50.00.""I am so glad I purchased this!  You can use your phone as the monitor and share the camera with anyone you choose.  You can zoom in, move the camera left, right, up, and down.  The night vision is phenomenal!  They also have a setting where you can get a notification if the camera detects movement or sound.  You can access your nooie cam from anywhere.  I went away for the weekend with some friends and left my husband home with the kids.  When I was feeling homesick, I could check the cams to see them.

Mine didn't work with the micro SD card. It fit, but would always say that no SD card was detected.

Very disappointing.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2021"
604,Student,Amazing product at a great price,"  Motion tracking makes it a bit finicky, and the controls on it are weird. Besides that, it's amazing for keeping track of stuff. I wish they would come down on price for outdoor cameras to keep it all on one app, but this one's well worth the money for a nanny cam type thing.Setting up to share with a spouse is weird, only one account can be logged on at a time so no shared accounts, you need your own.

I purchased these to be able to check on my toddlers while they are in their room. It takes a long time to load the view in their room, and when I try to move the camera it lags and ends up continuing to move even when I stop moving it.

The pan and tilt feature works well and is virtually silent.  The picture quality is very good even in low light.  In a nearly dark room the picture is good as well.  The app is intuitive and not overly complex.  A longer power cord would be a nice improvement to allow better cord concealment when mounting on a ceiling.

However, there is a huge lag in what you see on the Echo screen from what’s happening. I’ve gotten my baby quiet with a bottle in his mouth before and still hear crying on the Echo 10-15 seconds later or my husband would be back in bed already and I can still see him on the screen as if he’s in our sons room.

I love that the motion sensor follows her as she is playing so I know where she is at a glance. I also love how it adjust from day to night vision on its own.There are only a few things that can be inconvenient, first is sometimes the screen/camera can be hard to adjust/move at times. For example when the motion sensor picks up the movement of the curtains and then will focus on that and not my child who is still playing in the room and the screen can be difficult to get to move back. Or I will move the screen where I want it because child is napping and the camera will move to the wall. And the second thing is because it’s in a kids room I had to put it up on a shelf and because of that its not able to go down as far as I would like, so there is some blind spots in the room.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2019"

The 2 way talk is amazing it doesn't squeak or any loud noises perfect for a sleeping baby. The camera quality is very clear as well. The left to right motion is very wide. The up down motion isn't as long as I would have liked but the camera is very small so you can place it virtually anywhere plus you get a wall mount with the camera.

638,CDR,"Great product, the app could use some work.","  This is a pretty cool camera However! However, there are 2 issues that makes it a little iffy for me.1) I wish the app had an option to minimize and stay on my phone screen when I want to look at something else. Or at the very least kept the sound running on my phone in the background. I have to open the app every couple of minutes. I do have a tablet that I downloaded the app on so I guess that will be fine.2) The charging cable is pretty short. I have it mounted on the wall about 7.5ft high and needed a little extension cord in order to plug it in. My guess is that the charging cord is 3ft long?

I have a feeling that these reviews are false. The format of the app you have to download is like stepping back into a time machine to 2010.

After setting up the camera (which failed until I performed a hard reset), using the app to view live video almost always ends in an error message which simply displays ""Failed."" The only way that I can usually (but still not 100% reliably) watch live video is to unplug and replug the camera before opening the app, which defeats the purpose of a remote monitoring camera.

The motion detection is pretty good as well.  There are a few setbacks for us where we have to set the motion detection setting to ON each time after manually controlling the movement of the camera.  Another setback was the length of the power cord.  It’s not long enough for us to mount on the corner of the room on ceiling as we intended to use this as a baby monitor in the nursery.

650,Nathaniel Tarantino,Impressed,"  I bought the Nooie 360 Cam on a whim one day, just to try one of these motion cameras out. It was affordable (it was the Amazon deal of the day) so I wasn't expecting too much out of the camera. Boy, was I wrong. I was really impressed at the quality of the video. I put the camera inside next to the window, facing my backyard in an area I can't normally see from the living room. This so I can peek on my dogs (make sure they're not up to no good!) I already caught on camera one of my dogs trying to bite one of the sprinklers. The motion detector follows them, which is great because I don't lose sight on whatever it's detecting.  The night vision works great, but I don't normally use it because the nv reflects on the window so I just leave the backyard lights on. It was an easy install, just make sure you run it on 2.4GHz because it does not run on a 5GHz network. The only con I can think of is that sometimes when I'm out and about the camera fails to connect on the app. Not sure if that's the camera's fault, the app or if I'm just in a bad reception area at the moment I checked. When I'm home it never has that issue. Overall I was really impressed by this buy and at the value I bought it at.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2019"

It’s a wifi camera so it’s a few seconds delay from truly being “live” as a more expensive baby monitor.  Sound is decent but wish night resolution was clear as it’s hard to see baby’s chest rise up and down in the dark despite being mounted overhead. *update* apparently I didn’t realize you can view in landscape mode as well as portrait. Night vision is actually quite good in the larger view and you can see the little one breathing when you desire too.

689,Kylie Stiteler,Not Reliable at All,"  This camera is amazing when it works. Having said that, the app/camera go down every couple of weeks which makes it extremely frustrating. We use ours as our baby monitor, so it’s pretty important. All in all, would not recommend. If they’d fix the issues - which their customer service is also horrible - it’d actually be a good camera as picture, night vision, and sound are all great. But, it’s not dependable at all.

Comes with the proper instruction manual and it's easy to read! Imagine that! Everything you see is what you get and I simply enjoyed the product when I first bought it and after review I have to say, I still love it!

691,Marlice Dela-Seshie ,Great Camera!!,  I absolutely love this camera the only thing I don’t like is that you can’t record unless your on the app. I wish you could record regardless. Maybe there’s a way and I just haven’t figured it out yet. The night vision is great! The fact that while your watching on the app you can turn the camera to face a different direction is awesome and you can talk back and forth which is great and you can also take screenshots which is pretty cool too. Overall a pretty good camera.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2020"
692,BNI2019,DO NOT BUY,"  This camera just cannot stay connected. It is constantly cycling power, losing connection to the wifi, and the app takes forever to show you a picture on the rare occasions it does work. If you need it to stay zoomed in: look elsewhere. Not only is the picture quality poor, it’ll reset the zoom every single time you close your app and take even longer to focus properly.We bought this as a baby room camera and it has completely failed.

694,Kristina Ellison,Very Easy to install and use!,"  The Nooie cameras are by far the easiest cameras we have ever bought for our children's rooms. We bought the first one to use as a baby monitor in our newest baby's room and have since bought another pet camera for use in our basement to watch over the older children and also bought an outdoor camera. We have not set up the outdoor camera yet but with how easy the other two were to set up and start monitoring, we couldn't pass up buying the outdoor camera when it was on sale!

We deployed these Nooie 360 cameras throughout the house and have been very happy with the camera quality, performance and ease of access so that we can monitor our new puppy wherever he is in the house.

I love that I can screenshot from it also and save my baby pictures whenever I want. They are so cute when sleeping but after a long day at work, we all need our rest.

700,Stephanie Farley,Good camera,"  Been using the camera for a few weeks for when my son is napping, playing and occasionally at night. Works great, I like the 360 degree feature for when he’s playing that way I can see where he is at all times. I don’t have it set up for the motion detection, but I have put it on. I had set on high for the sensitivity and I would get notifications every minute or so because it was picking up the curtains moving about from the ceiling fan that was on. I really only use it for nap time to check on him. My only real gripe is when connecting to the camera from the app, sometimes it takes a min or so to load the camera view. I’m not sure if there is a setting to keep it streaming even when not in the app, but other than that, I don’t have an issue. Night vision is good when I have used it at night.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2020"

The motion detection is great and I like that you can set the sensitivity for sound or motion detection. Night vision is good quality as well. My only ""negative"" is the clicking sound it makes when it switches between night and day mode. It's not a big deal though.

The app software is constantly updated, we never really had problem connecting to the app to access the camera wherever we are.3. We LOVE the motion and sound detection features! And you can even set sensitivity level on the detection. We get notifications when our puppy starts barking or crying.4. You can talk to your puppy through the camera, so I was able to calm my puppy down when she was freaking out due to her separation anxiety.5. We use the camera as a 'security camera' when we are away with sound & motion detection on. (just in case anyone entered the house :P)6. The camera does very well on low lights and dark environment.Overall, we are very happy about the purchase and will definitely recommend.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2020"

I was close to buying a $200 camera when I saw this little one and decided to give it a chance and I’m glad I did! We love it. It was very easy to instal by our sons crib and the app is very easy to navigate and sends alerts to your phone. I like that you can adjust the angle of the camera and zoom in and out. It has great night vision but what I loved most was the two way audio. I work 12 hour days at a hospital and it’s nice to be able to see my little guy play and nap throughout the day and be able to interact with him. The only minor detail that I’ve noticed is that it’s a little bit too sensitive to sounds. It will sometimes pick up sounds from the hallway and send an alert to your phone.

Not to mention the setup took me hours versus not even two minutes with this Nooie. I am so impressed with the motion detection, the voice detection, the camera quality! Seriously they are both 1080p cameras but the image quality was so much better. This connects to my Alexa app and on top of it all it sends me notifications every time there is a sound or motion.

The accessory in addition to the camera consists of 1.5m power cord, USB charging cable, user manual and wall mounting plate.The installation in your own Wifi network is completed quickly. The in-house app is available through both the Google Play Store and the App Store. The camera resolves in Full HD and accordingly the recordings look good. The biggest feature is the camera has a 360 degree all-round visibility. The camera does not have to be rotated manually. The integrated motion sensor allows the cam to be automatically rotated and track an object in this way. The night vision mode could do a little better job. The quality is not bad. If the picture were a bit clearer, it would fit better with the  good features of the camera. 2-way audio function can be spoken through the camera. Live notifications when the motion sensor detects something moving are working properly. Recordings can be stored both on a micro SD card and in a cloud.The camera does your job very well.

I was only really planning on grabbing a cheaper camera to keep an eye on my two puppies in their pen, but I'm now considering putting one outside, and using the motion alert to cover the backyard. Even more appealing, is that Nooie offers the Aurora, which is a camera disguised as a light bulb. If it works as well as the 360 that I purchased, it'd be perfect on the back patio.The 360 also allows me to listen and/or speak to the dogs through the app - and future baby - which is awesome for when I'm not home and need to calm them or correct them trying to tear up their bed!So far very happy with the product.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2019"
739,Amy,"Great product, easy to use once you set up!","  Finding a baby monitor was so hard as we didn't want to pay a ton of money but wanted something functional to just have when baby is asleep and we need to leave the house for a couple minutes. I received this product in a day and was super excited to find such a good looking device when it arrived. Its super sleek in design! The set-up was a little difficult, simply because you have to have your wi-fi connection set to 2.4ghz instead of 5.0ghz. I'm not very tech savvy so it took me reading forums on how to get a dual-broadband modem from automatically connecting your phone to 5.0. Once I figured out how to separate the two connections via my internet provider, I was able to manually choose 2.4 for the pairing and it immediately worked. We did some trial runs with it and so far we're super pleased by the quality for the price of the product. Can't wait to use it once baby arrives!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2019"
740,Leandra,Great camera,  Great picture quality. I actually use this pointed at our front door until we get exterior cameras. I’ve been able to talk with pest control I’ve let in the house while not home as well as see packages delivered. I have not tried to playback from sd card but have the cloud subscription currently and that works great. I love that where I have it set I can actually move around and see other parts of my home. The 360 function is great. Great camera for the price. Thinking of getting another to monitor our playroom,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2019"
741,Kala T.,Ok camera,"  I’m giving 3-stars because it is a good camera for the price, but the click when the camera turns on for video is loud, the motion detection no matter what setting you have it on is touchy. It will go off at least 40 times in the 20-minutes I’m in the baby’s room putting her to sleep. It’s an ok camera but I ended up buying a different one for her room. I might save this one for a different time.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 5, 2020"

Set up is easy too and intuitive. The instructions were clear as well. I like how that you can stream for free and have the option to save the recording on a MicroSD. It has motion and sound detection, and night vision automatically kicks in when it gets dark.

The app (Nooie Cam) that the camera works with is simple and has a nice, clean interface. I am using it on an Android phone as a baby monitor and even in a near dark room the quality is good.  I had a problem with installation at first that was driving me crazy but a careful reading of the instructions says you have to install on a 2.4 GHZ Wifi. My Google mesh router has both 2.4 a 5 GHZ but it wouldn't connect. What you have to do is go to settings on the phone you are using for setup and temporarily change it to accept only 2.4 GHZ.

Picture quality is excellent and covers a wide area. The camera can record and follow a moving person or animal and does a pretty good job at tracking. I can monitor my home from work but I have 2 cameras set up and can only monitor one camera at a time through the app, I would like to be able to watch multiple cameras live at one time and maybe a update to the app could add this.

It does not track the movement, it will fixate on the wall or just a still shot and not actually record the movement going on. It also switches non stop from night vision to day vision so you can’t actually watch it clearly when you’re away single it keeps flashing back and forth. I had such high hopes for this to track the movement of my dog when he’s home alone. Also, you can not actually watch the camera with the app unless you’re in a place connected to WiFi!

795,YouStoleMyShirts,Best Camera Out There!,  We were a bit worried about using a wifi camera because of those horror stories on the internet but decided to try it out. I am so glad we did! The camera came and I was able to install it myself with a drill right above the crib. The picture quality is great! I can see our son breathing when I zoom in which is an added bonus. I love being able to see him on my phone no matter where I am. The night vision is perfect for when he goes to bed and I love that it alerts me when he cries or moves. I highly recommend this camera!

799,Amazon Customer,good for 1b1b,"  I bought the wifi camera to have ""an eye"" on the child at night and during the day sometimes to see the dog when he is alone in the apartment. I have to say I am positively surprised, both in the dark and in the day the camera delivers good and reliable pictures. What I find very useful is that you can both hear and speak. The installation was not difficult and if there are questions, the operating instructions are in English. All in all, a fair price for the stylish wifi camera.

801,Kenneth ,Exactly what I was looking for peace of mind while away!,  I love the alerts I get on my phone to the motion and sound detection. I work nights and my husband stays home with our kids. Being able to check in on everyone while I’m away is a huge help. Both the night vision and the daytime are very clear. Our internet has quite a bit of lag for most things but this keeps up with a quality image for a great price. I will for sure be looking into purchasing additional cameras to link for my other children’s rooms. The great thing about this is when they outgrow needing baby monitors I can still use this as a security feature and to check in on  the animals.

803,Jordan w ,DO NOT BUY IF YOU NEED AUDIO,"  I bought this to replace my $20 baby monitor, assuming that the features listed were actually present. Turns out, audio doesn’t work (no noise notifications, no live audio, nothing), support pages just tell you to download a firmware update (from the app, which doesn’t have the options that are listed in the instructions).Also, the night vision is terrible. That one isn’t a huge issue for me since my cheap baby monitor still lights up the room with IR, but good to know if you’re looking for a primary baby monitor.

The camera itself was also brilliant.My only take on this product is that it's not wireless. It has to be connected to power soirce at all times. I know I should've read this but it wasn't clear to me.For sure the product is recommended for any kind of monitoring for any room or area, not just child roomEdited: everytime you connect to a different WiFi, you have to reset the camera by pressing the tiny button in the back.

810,Amazon Customer,Worth Every Penny,  I have been so pleased with the Nooie 360 Camera. It arrived quickly and setup was completed easily. The camera quality is so clear even during night vision. I think it's great that it's possible to program motion detection and sound detection as separate functions or together as one function. It does truly move 360 degrees. Whether Im at home or not I am able to easily connect to the device from my mobile phone. Having the option to store audio and video files on an SD card or to have them store in the Amazon cloud was a huge plus for me too. Overall the Nooie is a great device with a lot of features that all work seamlessly and does to all with a 1080P picture/video.

I have also found the noise notifications have a good level of sensitivity. We have a small house and I can generally hear any noises that our baby makes - the camera microphone seems to pick up all the noises and alerts me on my phone or apple watch. I can then jump on and check if bub has gone back to sleep or is ready to get up/needs some help.It doesn't have all the bells and whistles that some more expensive models have (eg doesn't play lullabies or white noise), but we didn't need these as we have a little radio for these.

852,Amazon Customer,Nooie Baby Camera,  I actually use the Nooie baby camera  for my garage monitoring. Actually this is the third Nooie camera I own because it simply works well. This can easily be used as a baby monitor or baby camera but it's my cars I am most concerned about. The remote access through my phone using the app is awesome. It's an inexpensive camera with a outstanding video and app graphical user interface. I don't have a need for a baby monitor since my son is an adult. I plan on getting one for my backyard to monitor the wildlife.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2021"
853,Bree,Not for a baby's room.,"  This is a great camera for monitoring your home when you're away.... it is not so great for a baby room!! The ""monitor"" is an app on your phone so at night time if baby is in another room, you have to basically keep your phone on the charger all night with this app OPEN on your phone so you can hear the baby if he starts crying. There is a sound detection and motion detector but it only notifies you once and then it stops. Imagine if your baby is crying in another room and you dont have this app open or you have a notification sent to you just once? Not very good in that aspect. Woll be purchasing a new baby monitor but will keep this for around the house.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2020"

It comes with a wall mount so you can have a perfect view of your baby while it sleeps in the crib.

I left it plugged in a while to ""charge"" (or so I thought) but as soon as I unplugged it it stopped working. What's the point of a camera that needs to be plugged in?

The best feature is the notifications for motion detection.  If my child wakes up, I do not even have the app up to get a notification that there is motion in the bedroom.

After over an hour of initially setting up and installing the unit, I finally got it to work. But never again. Everytime after it said it could not connect the app to the unit, even though it had once.  My husband and I both spent hours troubleshooting the syncing of the unit with our phones, resetting the unit, and following the directions but it would not sync with the app (tried both iPhone and Android).

913,kerri,Quality matches description,  I was initially skeptical of the product because of the price versus the listed capabilities but I love it. It does exactly what it says it does and the video quality is great. I can share and remove viewers easily. The only draw back about sharing is the person you are sharing with has to create an account. I would suggest in the future the company look into temporary links that expire or something similar.

The connection with the router and the smartphone went quickly. With the app, the camera can be controlled well. The picture quality images is good. The video range is very wide, and the rotation angle is really big. You do not want to shoot a home video, but monitor your house, etc. The speaker or the two-way audio are also good to use.

On my phone its only behind by a second or two but on my echo it can be as far behind as 3 minutes. Which dosent help if my toddler climbs out of bed or my infant wakes up. The camera is good quality and the night vision is superb the only thing that holds it back is the delay.

923,gary wilson,"Great camera, but Nooie app cannot be used as other iPhone functions","  I really like this camera and the night vision, motion detection, and microphone work great. Only issue I have found is that when using the Nooie app to view the camera, you cannot have it on in the background. That is, the phone becomes an all or nothing proposition because you either view the camera or use the phone, but (for many thought not all apps) not do both at the same time. I have also found some weird volume fluctuations when I want to play music on app 1 while simultaneously using the Nooie app to view camera.

The resolution is very good, as are its sound and motion tracking features.  Even though the accompanying user manual/guide is minimal and rather skeletal, the mobile app and the camera are built with easy user experiences in mind, making it a breeze to setup and use.It pans both vertically and horizontally, giving it a wide field of vision. I've put in a 32 GB card, but I do pln to switch to the cloud service for storage if it works well.While I've placed the camera on a table, it has a setup that allows it to be attached to a ceiling, making it pretty versatile.I just wish the microusb power cable was longer (it's just 2 feet long), and that the camera worked with Google Home and Google Assistant (there's nothing online or in the guide that tells me if/how it works with either Alexa or Google).",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2019"

Great picture and easy setup. The only product suggestion I would have is I wish the camera could tilt down further. While the camera can be moved around and tilted up and down it really doesn’t go below the level of the Nooie. In other words you can’t set it on a shelf that is at the same level of a bassinet and shoot down into the bassinet. I’m working on a solution.

It had all the features we were looking for and then some. The picture quality is great including the nigh vision. I love that it has the 2 way audio and the ability to record and take pictures is a plus.

The notifications are fast and can be scheduled. This is the best indoor camera and at an unbeatable price.  The app is easy to use. The only thing is that you can only be logged in at one device at a time (it will log the other off, but you can share a camera stream easily with another account).  Overall It’s great, I own 2!

973,david,"Quite satisfactory, reliable sound detection","  I like nearly everything about this nannycam, it faithfully detects even the slightest noise and unobtrusively informs me via the Nooie app wherever I am. There is one issue: what is not advertised very well is the angle it can span: horizontally it spans the room very well as advertised, but not so much vertically. This might be a problem when mounting the camera at a higher elevation than your baby's mattress level.Other than this, if you're able to find the correct place to mount it with a good view of your baby's crib, it does the job very well.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2020"

We purchased this camera to be able to see our pets, but to also be able to see our oldest child on the rare occasion she is home by herself.

1163,Nilomee ,Great camera,  This is a really great camera I would highly recommend. The Monitor in 355°horizontally and 94°vertically rotation covers every cover in my house. The video and phone’s quality are super high even in the night vision. The motion tracking feature can track my dog’s motion so I don’t need to manually move the camera and it also allows me listen and talk to him. Besides the set up is super easy.

1170,S. Rubio,Camera is slow,"  This camera is incredibly slow.  Everytime I open the app on my phone to check in on my kiddo it takes at least 3 minutes to pull the image up.  And even then, sometimes it does not and I have to refresh it 3-4 times before it does.  At that rate, I might as well get up and go check on my kid.

Two big bones go pick though.... first, the micro cord that comes with the device is 3 or 4 feet....good luck mounting on a wall or ceiling. I’m being forced to purchase a separate cord for both. Secondly, my wife and I, along with grand parents all use the app and I have to manually put my password in every single time with no finger print ID or Face ID as options. I know I know first world problems but you’d surely think Nooie would make it easier to view the cameras.

1173,CB,Great system!,  I am in love with my new nooie cam! The set up was super easy compare to the last baby monitor system we used. It took about ten minutes and we were up and running. The picture quality is very impressive and the night vision is equally as good. The reason I was so excited about this one it said point blank that it would notify you for sound and motion happening in front of the camera. Sometimes our little one will hold really still while crying after a nightmare and this allows me to know there is an issue downstairs. My husband loves the fact that he can check in on her while at work and ease his worried daddy brain.

Picture quality is  also impeccable. However, the motion detection is not very accurate(so I turned it off).

I had trouble getting it connected to our internet at first, but my tech savvy brother came over and changed our internet speed to accommodate the camera (which has subsequently messed with our smart tv connection occasionally, but it’s manageable).

Maybe once a day it skips two or three frames while buffering but that could be my internet. You also will probably have to set up the separate WiFi network for the right speed.

1235,Amir ,EXCELLENT WIFI CAMERA,"  I find this to be an excellent wifi camera. With all the other 360 cameras out there at such high costs, this one is the best bang for your buck! It performs just as described and with the option of the SD card, you don't have to pay a monthly service to have a backup history of events. My only complaint is that the camera doesn't reset back to its ""set"" point after it tracks motion. if it tracks motion and the object moves out of sight, the camera will stay pointed in that direction until it ""sees"" motion again or you manually move it back to the ""moan"" view. it would be nice if it reset back after an amount of time lapsed from losing the tracked motion.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2019"

I placed it on the edge of a counter top in the centre of our open plan house. The camera moves in 360 degrees and also can move up and down. The voice activation works pretty well but could be slightly clearer.

You have to create multiple accounts and share from the main one (the one account in which you set up the camera) in order to view.

Haven’t used the motion or sound detection much but did test it and like how it sends notifications to my phone. The night vision is ok but wish it worked further. The only thing is that I pretty much got it for a baby monitor and can barely hear the sound through the app. I even had my wife get close to the camera and talk but still could barely hear it so I have to check the camera often to check on the baby.

I especially love that the camera and my phone don't have to be on the same wifi network after the pairing.  The only negative I can see so far is there isn't an option to record with your phone in sleep mode. Meaning your phone stays on.  Unless I just haven't found that option yet.  Otherwise, I love it!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2020"

   This camera is awesome! My favorite features are the fact that I can pan around the room and zoom in/out. The camera adjusts the video according to the light in the room, which is helpful especially since we have dimmable lights that have a spectrum of brightness. I have a screen recording that shows the camera adjusting the light as I open and close the door for a dark room. In terms of the video quality, it captures a nice wide view and is pretty sharp - we’re able to tell when our baby’s eyes are open/closed/blinking (and he’s got small eyes!). I also appreciate the security feature where only one person can be signed into an account at a time - others who want to view the same camera can be added if they’ve set up their own Nooie account, and it was such a simple and straightforward process.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2020"

Great camera for watching my baby! The quality is GREAT and you can hear and speak to baby! The audio, day and night vision is great!!! I love that it’s compatible with Alexa Show 8!! I also like that you can have your main login and then grant access to others (such as your spouse or grandparents). I personally granted access to my husband and to my other email so that I can use it on my iPad while I’m in the kitchen. So that’s 3 devices (my phone which is the main account, and the granted access on my iPad and my husband’s phone). On their accounts they cannot mess with the settings of the camera and cannot turn the camera off. Only on yours account. I just tell Alexa “show me nursery” (my camera is named Nursery because it’s going to live in the nursery once I move my baby upstairs in the crib) and she shows it to me. She does sometimes say “ok” and then doesn’t load the live view. Then I just repeat the command and she loads it up no problem. I’ve already recommended this camera to family that have recently had babies too!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2020"
4309,Amazon Customer,Amazing number of features for the price!,"  We got this for or newborn baby to monitor her at night. It's a perfect camera for this role. The 360 degree turn feature is amazing. Instead of placing the camera on a shelf like most baby cams, you can put this upside down on a ceiling in the center of the room and have 360 views of everything. It's not just limited to baby watching. In the future I can use this for home security, nanny-cam, or a pet cam. It's extremely versatile. Additionally the tracking and night-vision work really well. You can see very clearly at night in the dark.The tracking is not the smoothest and random movements like curtains from a blowing window will set it off. The tracking is also a bit jerky and not a smooth pan but honestly it works and I'm not all too much concerned. The app lets you control the camera remotely which is super cool. You can just use your finger on the image via the phone app and drag the camera around to move it. The controls for the camera are a bit clunky as it is reversed (drag left to go right, drag down to go up) and I wished you could change it as it takes some time to get used to. The motor is a bit noisy, not completely silent.The only thing that I would say needs to be improved is the picture quality. It's not super crisp even though it claims to be 1080p, but for its purpose it's good enough. Finally instead of purchasing the cloud storage, you can just buy a large SD card that will store weeks of videos.Overall this is a great camera. I imagine we will be keeping this around for years for several different uses and the price is amazing for so many features.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2021"
4310,Victor Riboldi,"Has some good things, and not-so-good things.","  I placed mine in the crib to keep an eye on my newborn.Good things- App is pretty user friendly for anyone who has a basic understanding of how things should work- Initial set up was also pretty straightforward- picture quality is good for the price- Night vision is good- hardware is small and light- you get notifications when sound is detected and you can set the sensitivity from your phone- you get notifications when motion is detected and you can turn it on or off fro your phone-has a live feed, as well as a back up option either using cloud service or SD card- can take screenshots- can invite other users to join the feed (they have to sign up for an account and get the app though)Bad things- short power cord- in hindsight, I wish I bought one with a battery- picture is fine and audio too, but horribly laggy if you try to turn in the mic. It makes no sense to use it.- takes a while to power up- sometimes will get confused and rotate on its own so you lose the focus. I kinda sorta remedied this by turning off motion detection- can’t use one account on multiple devices. So if I try to log in on my iPad, it logs me out of my phone. That is pretty annoying- not the best at balancing on soft surfaces.- laggy if you leave the app and returnOverall, I’m satisfied with it as I can live with the negatives. I’m not sure I would buy again without shopping around first though",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2022"
4311,Mariah,"Unreliable, had to return","  I thought this was going to be perfect for being a nursery camera and camera to 2 way talk to our 2 year old. First of all it was impossible to find a spot in the room that our 2 year old could not reach without having half of the room not visible in the camera. Massive blind spots and limited range of view.The camera was excellent quality and we liked the motion tracking. Unfortunately, the app was terrible and took forever to try to move the camera to view the room if it stopped tracking the movement. The app was also very spotty on reception. Sometimes we couldn’t even get it to open to view the room and we have the fastest internet that our cable company provides. The audio is absolutely terrible and ultimately why we returned it. The audio was constantly cutting out on the app and when trying to 2 way talk it worked 10% of the time.This could work for someone who just wants to check on their pet or home throughout the day with no sound, but beware of app issues and inability to pull up the viewing screen.

4312,Emily Jin,Easy to use. Failed decide after 9 months but there’s good!,  Set up took a few tries because the camera wouldn’t pick up the wrong code right away. ultimately this camera is easy to use though. The picture is very clear and motion sense is accurate. The App is easy to navigate if you are familiar with nest or other camera accessible apps.About 9 months into using my first 360 camera it shut off and never came back on. I tried resetting the device while plugged in but nothing. I contacted support and Ms. Alma was very helpful. I sent her a video of what was going on and she offered to send me a brand new device to replace it. I can appreciate a company that takes pride in their product enough to do this for the customer.Update…it’s just a few months after receiving the new device and it stopped connecting to my wifi. My other nooie 360 connects but then disconnects too. I even purchased a wifi extender even though my house is only 1000 sqft. This did not help any. I reached out to customer service but was not able to get whatever issue it was resolved. I even asked to try a different product if possible but I Guess I have two useless cameras and will have to try another brand because I haven’t been able to see in my babies room for about 3 weeks now going back and forth with customer support as they only respond at 2am each day.

I'm a very paranoid mom and will get up if it doesnt connect fast enough. Alot of times I'll have to go out of my screen,and back in again which makes me very unhappy.Two: I haven't found a way for the camera to constantly remain on my phone screen,almost like a little screen on ny screen, there seems to be no way to have it both waysThree: read another review about hearing people talk on the camera, If I ever hear ANYONE talk through the camera my rating will automatically change to a 1 star just because noone should ever have access to someone else's camera.♡Pros♡One-Has awesome picture quality!Two- can hear if my baby is cryingThree- Camera moves very fast if I need to see something (when its not lagging)Four- Affordable",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2021"
4315,Scott E Peppler,Great pet camera,"  Great little camera, setup was very easy.  I did have to turn WiFi off on one of my devices in the same room to get the camera to initially connect, but then it worked normal after that.  I liked that the included documentation there was a list of what the status LED lights mean, it made setup much easier without having to go online and find a FAQ page.Picture quality is very good, control is intuitive.  The talkback feature works well, but you might want to mute the sound on your device when talking, so the microphone on the phone doesn't pick up your voice playing out of the camera.It's a great way to keep an eye on our geriatric dog when at work.  Very happyUpdate:  We moved one of the 360 cameras to our front porch and it is doing a great job in both day and night modes.  This has inspired me to mount my workshop camera on the ceiling, but I didn't keep the wall mount., and Nooie Customer service is sending me a free replacement.

4316,Jonathan S.,Poor connectivity,"  I used this Camera for a month with my new rescue puppy. After a few weeks it continued having connectivity issues to wifi. I have a studio apartment, so my the router is within feet of the camera. All other devices work fine with no issues. After it looses connection, it's very hard to reconnect. I had to do factor resets multiple times to get it to reconnect, only for it to fail within minutes.I contacted the seller and had a replacement camera sent. Within a week, the replacement camera also failed. When I contacted Amazon for a refund, I was told I only have 30 days to return it, even though through my order history it said I still had a few more weeks left in the return window. I eventually got a refund. But this camera is poorly made. The seller is also through China, so the customer communication for a replacement took two weeks, since it was all through email and would only respond once per day.

4317,Amazon Customer,great indoor 360˚ camera.,"  got the Nooie  360˚ camera as a promotion.  Unboxing was easy and high class packaging.  A bit tough to get the wall plug and cord out of the bottom of the box - but otherwise fine.  Installation was easy.  Install the NOOIE app.  then press add device/camera.  Link to your wifi - make sure your phone wifi is on first.  Then have the Nooie cam scan the shown code.  within seconds to a few minutes it will link with a light shown on the camera base.  It will then want to update and reboot.  This will take about 5 minutes.  Lots of settings, from sensitivity, to human detection, to time modes.  Full color HD 360˚ view.  No complaints here.  Well thought out and even better than the d-link  360˚ camera we already have.  highly recommended!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 26, 2021"
4318,VITAMAN,Amazingly versatile,"  A friend bought this unit for himself and then decided he didn't need it so rather than returning it, he gave it to me to try. Since he bought it on sale, I thought it might be just a cheap camera, and so I didn't have high expectations. Boy, was I wrong! I discovered this would be a great little watchdog camera for my patio and backyard. I mounted it inside the house on a window ledge, behind the blinds, and facing straight forward. After experimentation, I learned it was far better than I expected, and faster to respond than a more expensive system that I use for my front porch. Setup was easy, I just plugged it in and followed the prompts on my phone, and it was up and running within 5 minutes. Mine is mounted close to the wireless router, so I had no problems with connectivity. At one point, I moved it about 15 feet away, and it performed well there too.On the window ledge, it picks up some reflectivity from the glass; however, during the day, this is barely noticeable. At night, the effect isn't enough to be bothersome. If the blinds are backlit with a lamp, visibility is affected, so I moved the lamp, and the view significantly improved. Also, I turned off the Night Vision mode because the glass reflects enough of it to blur the image and since the camera is inside, I disabled sound detection. What I found somewhat surprising was how well the camera picks up Motion, even though the glass. I have a dog door, and I can easily see which of my dogs has exited the house and watch it as it moves through the visible portion of the yard. It also reacts very quickly to any human in the frame, even with Motion set to Low. When I received the camera, I inserted a spare 8 GB card, and it records for about 36 hours before rolling over. Later, I swapped it out with a 128 GB card which often lasts two weeks before it begins to roll over. It is very easy to connect with the camera from my cell phone from anywhere and recording an existing video, or snapping a photo is quick and easy. I haven't tried the cloud account yet because I haven't needed it. If the unit were stolen, the video would be lost, so if you intend to mount this in a conspicuous place; the cloud account might be a good idea. For the time being, I'm content with using the SD card for storage. In the attached photos, the difference between day and night is illustrated. An external street light causes some glare. Even so, I am amazed at well this inexpensive camera performs when compared to more expensive units. I haven't used this unit inside my house, but it would be a simple matter to move it a few feet and do that too.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2019"

4320,Slim slater,Signal is weak,  This runs off of WiFi and is not a guaranteed signal. That will cause freezing of the camera and app and sometimes complete signal loss. It didn’t matter if we were using the internet or not the camera would still completely freeze. I also had to reboot several times when the camera doesn’t communicate at all.

That would not be so bad except that this happens if you have the app in the background even for a brief moment. Some app features don't bwork. When I contacted the app developers recently about the multi account capability, they responded that they haven't added that yet despite being a selling point.Also, recently the Nooie servers were down and the camera stopped working altogether. Let that sink in. The camera only works when their servers are up and running. No reason the camera live stream needs to be dependent on Nooie servers.Picture quality is only ok.This could have been a great camera but poor app and design choices make it a sub par baby cam.

4322,Jorge,Amazing picture,"  We have been using a baby monitor with a dedicated handheld monitor but wanted to try one that connects to our phones and saw this on Lightening Deal.Overall, it's a great camera. It has a great modern look to it and it has a really amazing viewing area. The night vision is crazy good and clear. You can zoom in really, really well with a very clear picture.The only reason I docked it a star was because it's dropped from our Wi-Fi a few times. Not sure if this is just the nature of the beast, our wi-fi, or the monitor, but it is annoying. That, and I switch between my phone and iPad depending on time of day (I use my iPad overnight) but have to re-sign in every time. Not a huge deal, just slightly cumbersome.Overall, this is a MUCH better picture, viewing area and zoom capability than the other monitor that we had for literally 1/3 of the price. It is also nice that both my husband and I can access the feed and that when she's older, we can use it to check in when she's home with a sitter and we are out.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2019"
4323,Jorge,Very glitchy and lacks sensitivity,"  As for the pros to this item, it does have great picture and when you’re viewing in the app, the sound quality is pretty good too. The night vision is also very clear and a plus.For the cons, and what makes this item not worth it to me, is that the motion detection and sound detection do not work very well. And it’s hit and miss to notice anything. We’ve been interacting with our daughter in front of the camera and it won’t notify us that anything happened but will randomly pick up noise from across the house. We use it as a baby monitor and I do not trust it at all to notify us what’s going on in the room so we always have the app open. Also, the video occasionally goes out which is also not ideal for using it as a baby monitor. We will have to be returning this to get a different monitor. The playback is also confusing and hard to control.I will say if you’re using it to just check in on your pets or as a casual check-in, this may work great for you. I just don’t trust it to help me keep an eye on my baby.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2022"
4324,Crystal,Great Camera Overall,"  I just read a negative review and decided to leave my own review.I've had this camera for over a year now. My sister bought it from my baby registry on Amazon and I recently purchased the other Noie indoor cam for her from her baby registry, as she's now expecting 😊.1. Set-up is a breeze once you follow instructions and are patient. If you need to change locations and go through the setup process again for any reason you'll breeze through it. Remember, set-up has to be done on 2G WiFi.2. The picture quality is great! - day and night.3. There's two-way audio, so you can speak to persons the camera is monitoring and they speak back to you.4. Motion detection is great, and u get notifications when movement is detected - this feature can be turned on or off in the Settings.My issues:1. I took the camera outside of the USA and am unable to have multiple persons log in due to cross-state issues as explained by a prompt response from Noie customer support.2. The Alexa app does not support the live view, and so I haven't been able to access the camera through the Alexa app, which would be nice for me as I have multiple Alexa devices and would like to manage them all from one place.3. The camera doesn't seem to go 360° continuously. You can swivel to a point and swivel back to the other side to a point, (I guess this is the 355° that I read just now. I came searching for a review regarding the Alexa app), but you are able to see 360° coverage.Overall the cam is well worth it for the price, and I don't mean the quality is poor or inferior, based on price. I mean it's a great buy as the quality is great and the cost doesn't break the bank.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2022"
4325,Masum ali,Not Reliable,"  While this started off good the first week, it has been sketchy since then. Sometimes I try to log on and I can't see the screen, like today - I have been logging on all morning to no avail. Sometimes when someone is home during the time it is supposed to alert me with the motion detection, I have no alerts even though someone will be waving right in front of it. So, not a reliable security camera.On a side note, the company keeps emailing me asking for my home address to send me more cameras, not knowing that mine doesn't work. I know with Amazon that private sellers can't see your information, so I am concerned that they are trying so hard to get mine, especially given their written English is so bad.*After I wrote this, it stopped working saying it had gone ""offline.""

If you wish to hang it from the ceiling you will need an extension cord- in order to use the manual swipe feature to rotate the camera and activate the motion sensor you must use the BETA version of the app.-  Two people can't use the same account. For example If I set the camera up on my phone I have to invite my husband to see the camera and he won't be able to change any of the settings from his phone.

4329,AUDREY FOULK,Great baby monitor,  This is a great monitor. Works well day or night. We needed one that would connect to our phone no matter where on the property we were. This fit the bill with out being crazy expensive.  Costumer service was great. I broke the mounting bracket ( no idea how because it is very easy to install) and they sent one with no issue when contacted. It was very simple to install and get set up on our network and phones(I got it up and working at 8 months pregnant with major baby brain). I love the audio detection alert so the video does not need to be up on my phone all the time. The medium sould level alert works perfectly for the baby room. We could not use the motion alert because she is such a wiggle worm while she sleeps it was going off constantly. This is a great monitor for a very decent price and i would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a baby video monitor.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2021"
4330,Tyrone,Great baby camera!,"  I got this as a baby shower gift, I added it to my registry because it had really good reviews and the picture quality looked decent. We got it set up and it is fantastic. The night vision is really great and overall picture quality is awesome. I can see my daughter clearly breathe so it is very reassuring. You’re able to move the direction of the camera from your phone. You can set up your motion detection zone so you aren’t getting false notifications from changes in light or a curtain blowing from the breeze. I’m extremely satisfied with this baby monitor!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2021"

   I like this camera.  For the price it's nice.  The 1080p holds up.  I have other cameras that are 1080p and get blocky and pixelated.  The Nooie Cam 360 is great in all the areas it highlights.  The app is easy to use. The 2 way audio is great and I can actually understand what I am hearing etc.The only thing I would like added is home automation options with Google Hub etc.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2019"

   Initial Impression:Arrived in nice minimal packaging - which I appreciate! The design of the actual camera is very small, simple, and elegant. Included instructions were easy to understand and even without them it wouldn’t be difficult to figure out the steps required to get the Nooie Cam 360 up and running. 👍Video Quality:Great video quality including night vision. Even when turning off the High quality setting and using just Normal video quality. Much better than most security cameras I’ve seen including the one we are currently using as our baby video monitor. I won’t mention names.Camera and App Set-Up:Setting up the camera requires pretty minimal effort. Once I downloaded the Nooie Cam app, and created an account, all that was required was to plug in the camera and wait until the status light flashed red. After clicking, “Add Camera” and confirming with the QR Code the camera was good to go.Camera and App Functionality:Motion tracking works great. Tested it with my son and had a lot of fun running around the living room letting it follow his movement. He thought it looked like Eve from the movie Wall-e. It doesn’t really look a lot like Eve but he’s 3 years old and having an imagination is important. 😁I tested the Motion Detention functionality and it worked great. Sends an alert to my phone immediately with the date and time code allowing the ability to simply click to view the video. This feature also allows for scheduling by time and days of the week so you can set it up for work schedules and not have motion alerts set for when you are at home.The two-way audio was also fun to play with and I can see how people with pets would enjoy this. In addition, if someone did break into your home you could politely let them know that the cops are on the way. 😉The only issue I had was with the Sound Detection. I tested it a few different times and for some reason this was not working for me. I contacted support and they advised me to reset the camera which took about 5 minutes and the problem was resolved.As for video storage I opted for the $5 per month Cloud storage option (by Amazon Web Services) rather than a Micro SD Card. The ability to record 7-day continuous storage for $60 a year made that decision pretty easy. 🤑Overall Impression:I think the Nooie Cam 360 is a pretty amazing little security camera. For $40 bucks this camera packs a lot of great features and I haven’t even explored them all. Looking forward to implementing this security camera with our existing smart devices to create a more efficient and secure home.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2019"
4333,Amazon Customer,5 stars,"  I initially ordered this camera just for its price point and because it had decent reviews. I gotta say though, I am thoroughly impressed with this little thing. A common fault mentioned by other reviews is poor connectivity or connection issues and I haven't experienced that at all.The picture quality is amazing clear in both day and night mode. I love that I have so much control through the app. I can zoom in, record, take screen shots, pan and tilt, mute the sound, and talk through the the camera. I love the storage option because it makes a time line of alerts for you to go back and view, instead if having to sit through hours of nothing to find activity.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2020"
4334,Yesenia,Nooie camera: Get it!,"  The Nooie camera has all the features you would want in a camera 360-degree turn clear crisp day and night vision excellent two-way voice communication and motion detection. Give this camera a try you won't regret it.  I bought 8 cameras and have had no issues.  I highly recommend getting this for your family.The setup was very simple using your phone or tablet, running the free Nooie Cam app.  You need to download the Nooie app from the app store.  Start the Nooie Cam app and allow the app to access the Camera.  Enter the password for the wireless access point/router your phone is currently connected to Then the QR code appears on the screen of your phone. You now hold the screen of your phone in front of the Nooie camera's lens and it provides an audible tone and LED light indicator when it is finished reading the QR code. It's that simple.  Repeat the steps for multiple cameras.Now that the camera has been added, you simply select it to view the camera. To hear audio from the camera, you select the speaker icon within the app and now you can see and hear what's going on around the camera. The camera also has a built-in speaker that allows you to press the microphone button within the app and then speak through it. This is very useful. With this 360 degree camera, either from home, from work, wherever I have WiFi or cellular access I can pan the camera from left to right and up or down. Its range is great where you can place the camera in the center of the room and from the app, turn it from its left side behind it around the front, through to the right side behind it just by swiping across the screen with the camera's image live the whole time. You can pan it around to see the entire room. Beyond this, you can tilt the camera up and down from the app as well by swiping up and down on the camera's image live.The Motion Tracking feature, if your cat, or anything, moves in front of the camera's lens, the camera will follow it. As the moving option moves close to the edge of the camera's current visibility, the camera will move to center the moving object within its view and continue doing this until the moving object either stop moving or moves behind something where the camera can no longer see it. One thing to note with automatic Motion Tracking is the camera can pan 360 degrees.The audio and video can be recorded to either a microSD card or to the cloud. Cloud storage is a paid service. Given my usage, microSD recording is fine for me so I haven't tried the cloud storage option. MicroSD recordings are easily accessed through the app via a scrollable tape across the bottom of the screen.In summary, the Nooie 360 camera works great and has a clear video. The two-way communication capability is a bonus and could open up its use to more than just a security camera. It's the ability to automatically track motion as well as it's the ability to turn 360 degrees while automatically tracking motion and/or by manually swiping the screen coupled with its low price point of under $35.00 makes this a fantastic buy! We are thrilled to have this camera.  So much so we added 8 cameras and plan to add more.  I enthusiastically endorse the Nooie 360 camera.  If you get it for your home you won't regret it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2019"
4335,Krystal,Awesome baby monitor!,  Was given this as a baby shower gift & love it! Was so easy to connect & set up. Picture is clear & even the night vision is great. I haven’t mounted it yet which works out well because I was able to take it on vacation with me so I can still monitor my baby while we’re out at the pool. This was a second camera after the first one I had on my registry was impossible to connect. Love this one & would buy it again! Only con I’ve found is the two way voice is slightly delayed & not always very clear.

4336,Aliana,"For Rotation, Download Blue Nooie App, Not Grey “Nooie Cam” App","  Purchased this monitor for my aunt whose husband, my uncle, had a couple strokes in 2015. He’s been more prone to falling lately and recently had to have surgery after falling and fracturing his hip/femur. She needs to be able to see him to have peace of mind to leave for any amount of time to ensure he hasn’t fallen and in need of help.The monitor works well. It has good picture quality. We ran into a problem where it wouldn’t rotate on demand like it was supposed to. It turns out we initially downloaded and used the wrong Nooie app. There are two: the blue Nooie app and the grey “Nooie Cam” app.Obviously, for our Nooie 360 *cam* we downloaded the grey Nooie Cam app. Everything, including the *automated* “motion tracking,” worked on it except for the *user controlled* rotation & turning, which is the feature we purchased it for. After downloading the blue Nooie app and signing in on it, the user controlled rotation worked instantly. So now there are no issues.

4337,Nathan Tyler,one parents thoughts,"  When buying a monitor for baby, there is a lot to consider - although you wouldn't think so at at the time.1. Does it travel well (no). Which isn't a big deal if you don't go home to visit family and need something to watch baby while they sleep in a new room2. Temperature?  No. Which isn't a big deal if you always have a ac on.. our parents keep their house so warm during summers. We bought a separate monitor that travels and shows temp, and glad we did cause the baby's room went up to 80+ in there at one point and we had to take her out and put in fans (heat increases SIDS).3. If your wifi is out will it work? No ... we loved the other monitor for when we had issues from time to time it works without wifi4. The BIGGEST question. Does it always work? NO!!!! The function to listen in on the room doesn't always work - so you can't exactly go outside to take the trash out or water the garden cause you won't hear baby on your monitor (phone). Speaking through the phone to the monitor has never worked. The camera sometimes turns itself a different direction when first started. The ability to save footage is a nice idea but the card stops working after a while (idk why!?) .It's just okay. Not the best thing. The only bit I love is being away at work and being able to see baby from where I am so I can tell grandma to check on her or get her up from nap.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2021"
4338,Porsche,Great ... When It's Working,"  This is a great camera when it's working: the picture quality, motion detection and night vision is fantastic. We intially received it as a baby registry gift, but after getting a smart baby monitor we decided to use it as an indoor security cameraIt works great ... When it's not disconnecting, inexplicably offline etc. It's admittedly very frustrating. The setup is not the most intuitive and took a few times to get right. And when we change our WiFi system, we had to do it all over again.The most frustrating is that it works when it wants to, which makes it something you might not want to use as a baby cam or security cam. You want consistency and reliability, and unfortunately, after a strong start, I now finding this camera to be underwhelming in those departments.Their customer service is quite nice but a lot of the issues I was troubleshooting was solved by Googling forums and reading threads with other people having issues.I really loved this device and recommended it to people, but now I'm just disappointed.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2020"

The timestamp showed on the app but it said it didn’t recognize my card. It hadn’t had a problem with my memory card up until that point. And the card still had 100gb of free space.

It does what it says it’s going to do. And the night vision is pretty good. The night vision is the best part.The problem I do have with this is when you open up the camera it takes FOREVER TO LOAD UP. Stuck looking at the load picture I attached. You get a notification that there was movement detected so you have to go to the app to see what happened and it takes so long to load. Anything could happen in that time. And the movement has already come and gone! And that’s even w purchasing their version of the “cloud” to playback and store video. Their customer service techs claim it’s my network…it’s not!The next problem I have is you have to have the app open the entire time and can’t be on any other apps and you can’t close the app because when you do anytime you come back in it takes forever to load the picture back up. I wish it was like a FaceTime call so that when you close the app you can still watch the video.I think with some updates and adjustments this app and product can be absolutely amazing!

We had another camera in their room previously because they can get a bit rowdy in there, but our biggest issue had been that we couldn't always see them depending on where they went in the room. Not the case with Nooie 360! It really does move EVERY direction and makes it easy for us to locate them manually or automatically, depending on the settings. We set it to follow motion in the room and it keeps track of them pretty easily. The sound quality is good and the zoom is amazing. The only trouble we've had is with the microphone; it works fine, but our internet is a little slow so there's a lag in the speaking/listening. I don't think that's at all the fault of the camera, but if you have a troublesome internet like ours, you may find that issue as well.

It would be nice to be able to set it to give an audio notification, too.- The mount included works well for a shelf or from ceiling, but not on a wall.  Our ceiling is textured, so I had to install a shelf just for the camera.- Configuring with Google Home can be a little tricky.  The first time I asked Google to Show the baby cam on Chromecast, it sent the video to my parents house in another state.  (I had helped them setup their speaker.)

I do wish that the saved video were just the active moments not a full 24 hr period. There’s no fast forward so it’s literally recalling the past in real time, additionally there’s no indications on the past clip as to when the active times were. The only reason it’s not lower is because the camera itself is still good.We got this as a gift for our baby registry. To say this exceeded our expectations is an understatement. I think my husband has thoroughly enjoyed playing with the settings and moving it manually on the app more than the fact that it works as described.

Some reviewers said that only one person can use the app on their phone, BUT, the primary person that sets it up on their phone just needs to send an invite to the other user and it works perfect! Just create different logins! We are able to access it from each of our phones and iPad all at the same time. The night vision and picture quality are great! I also liked that it simply plugs into the wall and doesn’t need batteries or chargers. Super sleek look as well. The motion detection is great too. It picks up all types of sounds and motions. I was hesitant to spend big bucks on some of the other ones but was scared to lose the quality with a lower price, but the Nooie 360 exceeded my expectations with affordable price and high quality. Highly recommend !",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2021"

Or in the cloud!The Nooie Team's Customer Service is fast, direct, and efficient!The people behind this is so warm and welcoming!Also, the camera can protect your house when you're outside, because it comes with motion and sound detection.It even works with Alexa and Google Assistant!It's compact, ergonomic, and fits wherever you want!Super great for the price!!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2021"
4360,Lori Springston,"Not good for long term use, app isn’t reliable","  My son is 5 months old, up until a few weeks ago this monitor worked great for us.  Now it disconnects from the app several times a night.  The only way to refresh it is to unplug the camera and plug it back in (not always the easiest to accomplish without waking the baby) and then when it does turn back on in makes a super loud chime noise that has woken my son several times.  5 months is around the time babies start rolling and sleeping on their stomachs, which can be scary and I like knowing I can check on him at any moment by pulling up the app.  But half the time it doesn’t work.  The actual camera itself is nice with good picture quality but what is that worth when you can’t see it?  (And no, it’s not my internet).  The connection between the camera and its app is unreliable which is unsafe.  I’ll be buying another monitor as I cannot trust this one.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2021"

Set up was super easy and it was also easy to connect to our Amazon Alexa Show. I like that this gives us the option to see the baby's room from either our phone or the Amazon Alexa Show in the event we have family over to babysit and they can just ask Alexa to see the baby room cam. The only thing I did notice is that the video lags quite a bit on the Amazon Alexa Show. But overall, we really love it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2020"
4362,Amazon Customer,Left me worried,"  Worked well for a while. Used it as a baby monitor. App update made it basically useless. Was concerned about the security of it as well. A couple of times I would notice it move on its own while we were in the room, or would not be in the position we left it when we went back to it. Several other reviews mentioned hearing voices coming out of it and that, combined with my own experiences with the device, was enough of a push to get something new. The app was updated at some point and it became very unresponsive. Often took several minutes to load, which is not what I want in a baby monitor. Eventually switched to a Logitech circle view which has native HomeKit secure video and no additional app necessary.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2021"

I tested it out on our older daughter (3) who doesn't need it as badly before I moved it to the baby's room. It takes several tries to get the camera to come on, if it will connect at all. When I can get it to work, I check the Wi-Fi signal and it's fine, so I don't think that's the problem. It's extremely unreliable. Sound detection is not enough to wake you up, and if you leave it going with the sound turned on, the app will eventually turn itself off or disconnect. It didn't start doing this until after we'd already had it for several weeks.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2020"
4367,Amazon Customer,Loved it at first…hate it now,  Loved it at first thought it was the best thing recommended it to so many of my friends…well I was wrong! First during the winter storm in Texas lost power and internet..this thing only runs on wifi and and has to be plugged into to work…useless for nearly a week…now I constantly have issues with it stay connected to wifi! Ughh long story short this thing is unreliable and pointless to have especially to use as a baby monitor! I literally went and bought a Motorola monitor is the best switch. Don’t spend your money on this if you’re trying to use it as a baby monitor it’s super unreliable and a headache to keep messing with it especially when your baby is asleep right next to it. Also the sound it makes once it finally does connect is loud! There’s no way to mute it and if it disconnects in the middle of the night and decides reconnect that ringing will wake you and your baby up!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2021"
4368,Amazon Customer,Not user friendly,"  It looked great and thought it would be a user friendly product but it’s been awful. The setup is long, you need to redo the whole thing anytime you change WiFi so if you’re planning on using it in different places it’s super annoying, and then you can’t have 2 users logged in on the same account so my husband and me can’t be watching the baby at the same time. Also anytime I want to take a look at what the baby is doing, I get the app opening screen for 3 seconds, then it takes at least 10 seconds if not 30 to actually connect and show me the baby, even if I just clicked out of the app 1 second before.

4369,Fernando,Fails to connect to phone most of the time,"  I was excited about this monitor for connecting to my phone and it was gifted to me for my baby showet. But, it fails to connect or maintain connection 8/10 times you use it. Sometimes it does not even connect when you're standing right next to it, and if you're far (less than 100 meters) it often does not work. Sometimes it works ok-ish when you're near the camera but that defeats the purpose of having a camera to start with.

Well I did not get an alert and walked in to my daughter screaming her lungs out. I'll be buying a different monitor since I can't trust this one.

When I move the camera around to different areas (kitchen, living room) it automatically connects within 30 seconds. The picture is outstanding! It must be HD because that's how clear the image shown. It is very easy to pan and tilt the camera. Prior ones I've had with that feature take a lot of time to respond to your movement on the screen and it becomes difficult to set the picture. When you want to move the image, you swipe up or down in the app and the picture moves immediately. High quality; low price.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2020"

I am constantly having to re-pair the camera multiple times. The app will shut down on me and when I log back in it’s just a black picture. Once the picture becomes available there is no sound even when I click sound on. It goes in and out and always buffering.

Ive checked the app to make sure my daughter is okay and it will be loading for a good while and there my daughter is crying!!

You also can’t customize the notification tone so it’s the same as all your other push notifications which is quiet and my brain has learned to ignore.

4729,Amazon Customer,These are awesome!,"  These cameras are awesome! I got 3 of them and I love them. I am using them for baby monitors. I had already ordered and returned so many expensive baby monitors and they were so complicated some to the point I couldnt even get them set up. I spent less on these and they are way better! Picture is so clear, you can attach multiple cameras to the app which is great because with the baby monitors I purchased you could only do up to 3 some only 2. They are super easy to set up they took my husband a whole 5 minutes, the WiFi is so easy to connect and they don’t get disconnected like the others were. The only suggestion I’d make is having some sort of base you can connect them to that moves around on different angles because you have to place these flat and in order to see the whole room they’d have to be up high but there’s no way to adjust them on a slant to see down to the floor. There is a crib base that’s bendable but I need to see the entire room not just the crib. If I could find some sort of slanted bendable base that connected to a wall these would be perfect!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2021"
4730,Amazon Customer,Great Little Camera,"  I purchased this camera primarily to use as a pet monitor.  My dogs prefers to be uncrated when left alone, and normally does fine, but on rare occasions decides to be naughty and forage for anything that is accessible.  The camera is simple to setup and pair with the app, and the camera controls through the app work fine.  The picture quality is good and on par with what I expected.  Although the voice/speaker features of the camera do not reliably work (e.g., lots of lag, breaking up speech, even with strong internet connections), this is not a deal-breaker as I did not purchase it with the intention of using this feature much.  The app is a bit clunky in some aspects, but overall works fine.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2021"

The only con really is there's no temperature reading which I knew. If it did, it would be the perfect baby camera. But for those who don't care, this is probably the best indoor security camera you can buy for this price.

I bought it and fell in love with the night vision, motion detection alerts, microphone, etc. so I bought a second one. After about six months neither of the microphones put out any noise on the cameras. The app takes well over 30/45 seconds just to pull up what camera you’re trying to look at. In the beginning everything was quick, loud and precise. Now I’m waiting for the day I lose enough patience with them to rip them down and throw them in the trash.

I can pull up a picture and it will sporadically be live but mostly is delayed, especially when I’m talking from my iPhone 8 to the camera.  I have friends that have this same camera and they love it, but they’re on a different kind of network, so I’ve decided that’s my problem.

First of all, after a week the camera stopped connecting to my Alexa which really sucks because using the app drains the heck out of your phone battery. Second, turning the camera is incredibly laggy. Sometimes it won’t work at all and ends up freezing the whole camera. Another issue is when I try speaking into my phone so my kids can hear me, it takes so long for what I say to actually get to them and also cuts out what I say quite a bit. Camera quality is good but all of these problems haven’t made anything any easier. If you have the patience then it’s a good cam.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2022"

I think the motion detection and the camera moving to that place seemed a little slow but I've never had something like this and don't know what to expect. Make sure you don't have ""fiber optic"" internet because it won't work. I still need to get it plugged into a place where I'm using it everyday but initially getting it set up it seemed like good picture quality and sound because you can talk to it which is really cool. There doesn't seem to be any subscription charges or anything like that and I really hope that doesn't come up.

I have been traveling a lot and watch my now 2 year olds thru the camera and say I love you and goodnight and they look around to see where mommy's voice is coming from and they talk back and I can hear them clearly.

4833,Brianna,Overall Good Product,"  I use it for my daughters room to see what she’s doing while I’m around the house. Pretty handy. I love it honestly. The picture is clear, I can see easily at night, and it swivels enough to get a good view. My only wish is to have it be able to record so I can go back without having to purchase some sort of storage. Everything is only in real time and precise too so I’m happy overall.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2022"

4837,EmmaBeth,Don’t waste your money,  Bought this camera to keep in my sons room and at first liked it but as I got to use it more everything was to tedious to do. Set up took forever (3hrs)!! On top of that the camera it self was constantly moving around and not keep in focus of my child. At one point I heard the start up sounds again so I bet someone hacked into our camera which is very scary. My son would also wake up in the morning and first thing he’d do is wave at the camera and go straight over to it as if someone else was watching him and he was curious. Which he’s never done that to any other monitors we’ve had. Overall not a great buy at all!! Doesn’t seem very safe especially if your going to put it in your child’s room.

4839,Bailey,Not a good product,"  This product is NOT WORKING at all for my family. It picks up noises from way down the street and if a tiny little fly is in the room it marks that as motion. It’s too sensitive. And along with that, even though the Internet in my house is very strong and we have no issues with wifi related to other products, this monitor keeps dropping from the Wi-Fi. It won’t connect to my phone anymore now. My phone won’t even recognize it. I didn’t start have these issues until after the return window was closed so I only have the option to pay the 20 percent restocking fee or replace it. But I wouldn’t want a replacement either since this product isn’t what I was originally thinking it was. There are better products out there.

4840,Mama Liz,Works great!,"  This works great! I can see what’s going on, move the camera, and talk through it.  Motion detection works great as well. I don’t have a card in it so I can’t do the playback and it takes a minute to load everything after getting a movement notification, but it’s picked up movement every time! My husband and I both have the app on our phone with the same account so we can’t both be logged in at the same time, but we get a notification when we’ve been logged out because the other has logged in.  We changed the WiFi password recently, and it took a few to get it reset, but it all worked no problems!

4847,Rossi,2.4Ghz only is a problem,"  I bought this when our old baby monitor died. It has been pretty useless for me because every time our wifi cuts our, I have to reset. It was a ream pain to make a 2.4Ghz network in our house and it makes all our other devices constantly switch networks. Also, I can’t use this camera when we travel, because I can’t set up a 2.4Ghz network, so I can’t connect this device to my phone.Once the device is setup, it has good function (great picture quality, motion detection, night vision). The tracking is very slow - not like a regular baby monitor. Overall I’m pretty disappointed. Apparently a lot of these kinds of cameras have this 2.4Ghz restriction. Wish I’d known!",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 12, 2022"
4848,JHERO,Terrible,"  This camera was bought to use in baby room. It is extremely inconsistent. It hardly ever gets to wifi and when it does, it only maintains its connection for maybe 4-5 hours. It will constantly say “wrong wifi password” even when the password is correct. You download an app the is extremely glitchy and most of the time you have to restart it several times before you will get the camera (on the off chance it actually connects to the wifi) to work. I have reset my wifi, my camera, deleted the app off my phone and reinstalled it repeated as per customer service to know avail. Customer service takes forever to reply and promise a new camera but will give you the run around on how to fix it. They tell me to try the same thing to fix the connection problem in every email. After a month of back and forth emails they said “we can only give you 50% off a new camera”. Waste of money for a cheap camera that works 10% of the time.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2022"

4862,mohamed lababidi,3 month defect but company replaced,  EDIT: I originally was extremely disappointed with this product as it only worked for three months. But have recently given it four stars because the company contacted me and provided me with great customer service and a solution to my product defect. I only give it four stars though because it took 7 months for the company to contact me or do anything about it. And therefore I had to go and buy another baby monitor.ORIGINAL review: Was great for three months. But then it locked me and my husband out of the app and we had no way to reset it. Ended up buying a different system because I gave up trying to figure out how to get this camera to work again.

However, less than about 6 months in, the camera started having connectivity issues. Resetting, moving it closer to the router (and farther away from where it was supposed to monitor), and reconfiguring the Wi-Fi didn't help.

This seems like a significant oversight. You could assume that a person might not want to unplug/plugin a camera while the child is sleeping, but you will almost always be rotating the camera while they are.3) After 1 year the audio feed has completely failed.
