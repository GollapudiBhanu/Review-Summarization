0,Sock My World,READ THIS BEFORE ANY OTHER REVIEW,"  I also had an issue with the mount and spent an hr trying to secure it on with no luck. I am tech savvy so this thing shouldn't be as hard as it is to simply mount the doorbell to the mount. I just put my return in and was just frustrated all around. To get a new one would take almost a week. I decided to take a breath and a dab. I sat down and closely looked at the backing and the mount. YOU HAVE TO put alot of effort into sliding the mount on. Once you closely look at how the inserts go in line it up and push REALLY HARD sliding the doorbell down. It will slide and lock into place. It shouldn't be this hard to put on and I can see why people are leaving poor reviews. Trust me on this though and don't give up!UPDATE: day 2 and so far so good. I've realized the reason for it being so hard to put the mount on, its to make it VERY sturdy when the doorbell is attached. I've read a review talking about this being easy to steal and I would have to disagree. The door bell isn't going anywhere unless someone takes a hammer to it. The picture quality is really good, the picture I uploaded to this review doesn't compare to the live feed view on my iPhone. This doorbell comes with an ""armed"" and ""disarmed"" mode so when you're not wanting 100 notifications because of birds flying by your doorbell you can disarm and when you leave the house or go to sleep you can arm, I found this convenient.UPDATE#2: Its been over a month now and no problems whatsoever! I went out and bought a 128GB flash drive to put into the module and now my recordings are being saved straight to that. This makes life a lot easier when accessing stored clips and transferring that data to a PC. The doorbell is still nice and tight and working like a charm. For the price you cant really go wrong with this doorbell combo. I suggest purchasing the combo and not the stand alone doorbell itself unless you already have a module in your home.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2021"
1,Sock My World,Well worth the cost & perfect add on for existing Blink customers,"                    The media could not be loaded.
                




   If you are like me you are a happy existing Blink Camera user who is thinking about adding the door bell to your existing setup. I had a blink camera setup aiming at my front door so at first I was not too sure that I really needed the door bell.  However for the cost I am very glad I got one.  There are a couple of things to know:(1) If you are an existing Blink customer, you do not need a second sync module.  All you need is the door bell and you can simple add it to your existing account (as easy as adding an additional camera).(2) If you are planning on hardwiring the blink doorbell to your existing doorbells wires. . . . you still have to use 2 AA batteries to power the camera.  This did not make sense to me as I figured my hardwires would power it, but sure enough after calling Blink support I realized I needed to put the AA batteries in the camera.  The hard wire will allow your blink doorbell to ring the doorbell in your home but will not power the camera.(3) You can turn on motion detection or just have the blink door bell turn on when the door bell is rung.  This is a nice feature.  If you want to catch anyone that comes to your door (whether they ring the bell or not, you can simple turn this feature on in the app).  If you want to save battery life and are only interested in door bell ringers you can turn motion detection off.(4) It has two way audio, meaning you will always hear the person at your door. . . . but you can also choose to speak to the person if you choose.  For me the audio the person at the door hears comes across a little staticky, but that could be my phone or the fact that I am using the corner mount.(5) It has more of a fish bowl view so it catches a wide view (meaning it can cover most of your front porch)(6) There is no additional cost to having the Blink doorbell or camera system.  Unlike other door bell systems out there, there is no additional cost to the Blink Doorbell.  The app is free, cloud storage is free, downloading images or videos is free, etc.If you are looking to set it up with just batteries and no wiring to an existing doorbell system, setup is a breeze (will take two minutes).  If you are looking to hard wire it, it is still pretty easy.  I am not a handy man and what I know about electricity will shock you (get my joke) but even I was able to hard wire it.  Get the doorbell, you will be glad you did.  Hope this review helped.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2021"
2,Whose That Guy,"Potential to be great, but not yet.","  A few years ago I was excited to see that BLINK had a doorbell announced at CES so I committed to a multi-camera setup. After it became apparent it wasn't being released, I purchased a RING doorbell and subscription plan begrudgingly. The minute I saw the pre-order for this, I instantly grabbed one. Excited to have everything in one ecosystem, the anticipating and re-excitement from years ago was there. During the waiting period I realized someone pointed out, which at the time was NOT listed on the pre-order page, that you need a Sync-2 module to save the footage/rings. I had a spare but it could have been annoying. Fast forward to today when I received it. It looks beautiful and is a slim profile but the mounting bracket is an absolute joke. 2 shallow screws and no thumbail screw to lock the device in, this could easily be ripped out of the wall within 2 seconds. Combine that with the amount of pressure needed to lock this device into place, theres no doubt in my mind that after a year of changing the batteries some of these small clip/brackets on the plate will indeed snap. The image quality is way too HDR and totally blown out by the sun and bright daylight in the sky, creating a darkness on the face of whoever rings the bell which surprise, kind of defeats the purpose. Lastly, the fact that Amazon did NOT have the mount was the cherry on top. The email they sent later allowed us to order the corner mount free of charge, but inside the blink app it states that it should come with a couple different mounting plate options which it did not. So all in all, I prefer the Blink ecosystem to most and physically this doorbell is great but for something in R&D for 3+ years you definitely dropped the ball on the easiest pieces of the puzzle, especially for a company that owns RING which has an excellent mounting package in the box.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2021"
3,Whose That Guy,Not sure why all the negative reviews,"  I got this and just mounted it. I will say that the instructions are not very detailed but being tech oriented I was able to figure everything out. I added the blink app and connected the sync 2 module up using the app instructions which were fine. I did buy a 256gb usb for internal storage which was detected in the app. Once the sync module was up I added the batteries to the camera but left the back off. In the app you add the device as a doorbell and follow the setup. Once done I took the back outside and started to mount it. Prior to mounting you have to leave a small space on the side so you can put the cover on. In my case I left a little on the left. Mine is mounted on the trim which is on a corner so I did use 2” screws with the same thickness as the ones provided and also took a little clear weather caulk to give it as seal. Don’t cover the contacts on the back. The longer screws hopefully with deter someone from stealing it but my neighbors has been up for months. These screws were long enough to get to the wood door frame. I did change the 10sec delay to 15 so less pics are taken as we are coming and going. Quality looked good on a cloudy day so I’ll have to see how night is as well. So far I like it. We shall see how the battery does. I’m adding the fact that once the 30 day trial ended my local storage took over; however, not having the sub takes away the ability to delete more than one at a time. That’s ridiculous",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2021"
4,themike,Impressive little doorbell,"  There’s a few more steps to set up, and requires a blink sync for completely wireless use. Camera quality is there, wish the box came with double stick tape, but I managed. To set up the chiming on an Alexa you’d have to have the skill installed once it’s installed it recognizes the doorbell. For the price features and true wirelessness! I recommend!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2021"
5,dschott,Works well!,  I got this doorbell because it’s cheaper than the Ring one. It was easy to set up. Two screws into the door frame and I was able to slide it on. The camera works well and I was able to link it to all my Alexa stuff. I did the no wire worked and it works well!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2021"
6,TechJunkie,Impossible to mount.,"  This product is structurally defective, don't even attempt buying this, all you are getting is a poor quality camera that cannot be mounted on any surface, if you want to buy a camera that can't be mounted anywhere without the use of duct tape this will surely be that.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2021"
7,Madora,Needs a Better Security Mount,"  I just installed this and it seems to be working fine so far, not more than an hour on it so far. I got the sync module to work fine and it is all hooked up. The door security mount is terrible, it would take someone no time at all to steal it, the set screw that you had on the other model seemed like a better option. But this thing is just out there for the taking, also the 6 retainers that are on this take a bit of time to figure out that you have to push down with enough pressure for them to set and hold. Do you have a recommendation for a better security mount since this one is really bad.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2021"

   In my opinion this is a good product but reason for 1 star is because of the simple design defect and waiting about 1 month for the release of this product. I love blink products but this is something that must be addressed because I see I’m not the only one having this issue. The waterproof seal is a defect either it’s to thick or the seal is to hard and won’t compress enough to allow you to put the back end onto product. Sadly that’s the only fix or blink sends a new seal. In my opinion it’s such a simple defect hopefully someone from blink sees my review and try’s to correct this some how. I’m a tech enthusiast and love all of blinks products but just hate to see the product fail because of a simple flaw after it took a while to test this for consumers. Will later change it until there’s a update in design and there is a fix for this",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2021"

   I've been a Blink customer since the beginning. I have every iteration of their products and was excited to see them offer a doorbell. That excitement wore off quickly after I installed their doorbell and soon turned to disappointment. Here are my issues with the doorbell:1. Short battery life. Even though it's connected to my 24VAC doorbell transformer, it still runs on battery power. I have burned through the first set of lithium AA's in less than 3 weeks of use.2. I had to purchase their angled mount ($8) separately because my doorbell button is low and the doorbell camera was cutting off the heads of tall people.3. Notifications. This is my biggest beef. Right now, if someone rings the bell, you get a  standard notification on your phone. You can also set your Alexa devices to make a voice announcement that the doorbell was rung. That's it. You don't get automatic  live video of the doorbell camera on the app or Echo Shows, Spots etc. You don't know who's there. I suspect this is a hardware limitation of the Blink system. When a Blink camera is recording, you can't pull up a live video feed. I'm doubtful that this critical feature will ever be added.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2021"
10,Amazon Customer,Good For The Cost,"  This is a hard camera to mount. It requires you mount the bracket in place very tight before trying to attach. It requires a lot of force then slide down in place. The first one I received was impossible and seem latch was broke. But Blink directly reached out to me and sent another one quickly. It went on and looks good, but like I said requires a lot of downforce. Needs to be a better design.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2021"
11,Ed Moore,"Unless you enjoy hours of frustration, DO NOT BUY to record to local USB.","  The Blink video doorbell + sync module 2 might be somewhat OK if you want to continue to utilize the cloud storage option (free 30-day trial is activated by default - probably so you think it works better than it actually will once you cancel the cloud service), but if you're planning to use this setup for local motion-activated recording to a USB stick,  I STRONGLY advise against it. I spent 4 hours last night trying to get the local storage working, and while I would receive motion alerts on my phone, it never once recorded any video. I tried 3 different USB thumb drives, all formatted in exFAT with a PC and with the sync module. Spent over an hour on the phone today with tech support, and while he connected to both the sync module and doorbell repeatedly (and did several reboots) he couldn't figure out the problem either. Then he asked me to download some sketchy app that collects all kinds of info about the health of my home network, and sends it off to who knows where. Yeah, I'm not going to do that. I offered to provide him whatever ""health"" info he needed about my network by using one of the apps I already use to monitor my ""network health"", and he said I had to download that specific app because it's required as the next step in troubleshooting, or he could no longer help me. I also tried troubleshooting using their online support, and encountered endless ""502 Bad Gateway"" errors.Other factors you might want to know:Even if you do finally get the local storage working, according to Blink's website, videos are first transferred to Blink's servers, and then to your USB storage - so you're still dependent on Blink's servers, which is also something that can be taken away or made a ""Premium"" feature in the future.Summary: If you're wanting local storage (a feature that appeals to many of the people interested in this product), this product is FAR from being ready for prime time, and the tech support infrastructure is terrible.

12,Ed Moore,Impossible to mount,"  I thought I'd have a problem with the technical setup, but I assumed mounting it would be a cinch.  I had it backwards.  I did call tech support to help with setup, but that turned out to be easy.  The mounting instruction video makes it look so easy -- press, slide it down, and it's on.  I can't tell you how many times I watched that video and tried, over and over again, to get it to click on.  I was ready to hit it with a hammer to see if that might make it snap into place, but the guy on tech support advised against it.  I really wish I could have gotten it mounted, because I liked everything else about it.  I'd say it has a definite design flaw.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2021"
13,T K F,READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY:  The doorbell that does not chime in your house.,"  This is the most ridiculous doorbell I have ever used.  THERE IS NO CHIME BOX INSIDE YOUR HOUSE, so the doorbell will not ring inside your house, so you will never know if someone is at your door, unless you are holding your phone and staring at the screen to see your ""app notification"".  How could they design a doorbell that does not have a way to attach a chime box inside your house so you can hear it ringing?  Sure is silly to go through the blink app at the end of the day to see how many people sat on your porch ringing your new high tech doorbell that does not chime in your house.

   I had already had to blink exterior cameras so when I had the chance to pre-order the doorbell camera I jumped on it. The doorbell camera does its job. Image quality is great day, and night. At night time the infrared is good allowing you to have good clarity and resolution. You get quick notifications when someone is at your door. You can set it to capture any motion at your property. You can set focus areas, and private areas. You can set the length of record time from 5 to 20 seconds.  The placement of the doorbell we'll also impact what's your camera picks up. But after having had and installing various types of doorbell cameras from Ring and more. I'm satisfied. Why go and buy a $100, or $200 option when you can purchase of $50 option that is just as good.Sure there are some drawbacks, but they will be drawbacks with all of them. If I had to point out any one drawback is that the cameras motion capture has a cool down before it can record again.  Example: if the camera has a view of the street and 2 cars go by, the second car could go by without ever being captured on video if it wasn't recorded in the same clip as the first car.You can extend to about of time each clip is allowing you to get more footage. But longer record times use more battery life.I got this one because I already had a hub, and 2 cameras I can capture any, and everything that comes my way. All my Amazon packages are safe, and I know whose at my door Everytime.Bravo, and thank you Blink.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2021"

18,koufax,READ before returning camera due to difficulty of camera mount bracket,"  I returned my initial camera for a couple of reasons.  I was issued a refund.  However, after several days (and maybe because of my background and I own multiple Blink cameras and my review - I was contacted by Blink and given another Blink Doorbell camera to test and evaluate.  Here is my first tip at eliminating some of the frustration of mounting the camera.Before you start drilling holes in your home to mount the camera - or ready to return the camera because you can’t get it to snap into the back-plate while in your hand or remove it once it is mounted.  Do yourself a favor and test-mount the back-plate on a scrap piece of  2"" x 4"", plywood, etc  (any piece of scrap wood will work as long as IT IS FLAT).  Doing this will let you test and see the ease at mounting and dis-mounting of this camera using the supplied tool.  Hey, if you can't get it to mount on a flat board that you can flip around here and there  - why in the heck would you want to drill holes in your home's door frame or brick and not be able to mount it?  That's only going to make you more aggravated - which is what I did with my first camera that I returned. I did the TEST-MOUNT myself.  And, in doing so - I think I have found what I call ""the niche"" for mounting and dismounting the camera.  Once it seems flush with the back-plate - push the camera upward until you hear a tiny ""click"".  That is the clip at the bottom locking in.  Use the supplied tool to unlock and repeat this again until you feel comfortable with mounting this on your door frame.NOTE - In my opinion, Blink offers one of the best customer support sites I have encountered.  If you have an issue - call them.  Over the past 2 years,  I have had to call them from time to time.  They have helped me with warranty issues and answered my questions to resolve my problems.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2021"

Firstly, it took forever to get this connected to my Blink platform, continual error message and connection fails.Once I finally got this installed I could not get it to connect to my existing chime, despite the fact it met the required specs (16-24V). To me it felt like the metal connectors on the bell were not connecting to the back cover metal connectors.After clipping the unit on and off the back cover several times (attempting to make chime connection) one of the plastic connectors bent making reconnection between the bell and the back cover almost impossible.Finally the tiny flimsy metal connector in the bell snapped rendering the whole thing useless.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2021"

24,Katie&Matt,Take away the designers crayons!!!!,"  I’ve supported Blink since it was Kickstarter. Big fan, own 10 cameras. Was excited about a doorbell. Hate it. Mounting it on a stucco wall was pure misery due to the flimsy back plate and the worlds most stupid mounting design. Plate flexes so bad that aligning it to mount is next to impossible if mounted to an uneven surface. Tolerance is way too tight to get the plate back on when flexed even a little bit. And good luck finding that tool to open it back up when the batteries die. Needed tech support to get it recognized in Alexa, but to Amazons credit, they were quick, responsive and did a great job. Named it doorbell when I added it to my network, but now the announcement is “There’s someone at your doorbell”.  I’ve changed every name and setting I can find to front door. Still announces it as doorbell.I blame myself, should have waited for the 2nd generation. But in my defense, Blink has done such a good job on previous releases, and I consider them to be a mature manufacturer now, it never occurred to me they would release such a POS product.

   Received this item yesterday. Was able to install the doorbell today. Fairly easy installation. Camera quality is good. I chose this doorbell because of the ability to wire it to my existing chime box in the house. My house was built in the early 80s & the original chime box is compatible & does ring when the doorbell is activated.Got the sync module 2 combo because I had the original sync module for my outdoor cams & wanted to upgrade to local storage. Ordered a Sandisk 256 gb usb drive & works wonderfully with the local storage.If this doorbell cam is anything like the outdoor cameras, I expect the night vision to be good. I tested the microphone & sound quality is as good as I expected.If you’re in the market for a camera doorbell, I do recommend this one.

30,S. Stanley,Poor Product Management,"  First my batteries are dead after one week and although my door bell is wired I am told the wires will not power my Blink... with no better explanation. The mounting screws are wrong, they have rounded heads which interfere with locking the doorbell on its mount. Flat headed screws would fix most of those problems. The base is so flimsy that you must mount on an absolutely flat surface or the doorbell with not lock on the base. There is no explanation of the dimensions needed by the base plate, I cut away too much moulding for lack of info. There should be a ""wedge to angle the camera out from its corner in an installation like mine, there is only a wedge to look up not ""over there"". There should be a link or something to a primer on door bell types so people can trouble shoot things like ""The wired installation will not power your door bell because..."". All in all it seems like a Chinese product that would have been better if the developers were Americans who were familiar with American housing and doorbells. This product reminds me of an old Product Manager's mantra ""Be Happy, Ship Crappy""; true this was so a product would ever ship at all because engineers are never ready to ship. Bottom line is it does not uphold the standards that Amazon sets for its products  and it should.Update:My original search for the ""corner wedge"" only found the ""down wedge"" however the corner wedge exists! I found it at the Blink Store section and it arrived today and looks great. It fixes a lot of issues.The afore mentioned dead batteries were a missdiagnosis. The door bell went off line the first day for a while but came back when I rang it. When it went off line again it would not ring (sense me thinking it was batteries) but instead I followed the WiFi reset procedure and it came back to life; it had to be re-added to the Sync 2 as a new door bell. Fortunately I renamed it the same so Alexa's Skill would not get confused. So there seems to be a WiFi issue. FWIW I run a top of the line Netgear router.Now on to another issue... Wired but no power!! The instructions say nothing about the possibility that your existing door bell may have a diode at its button. If a digital chime is added to an old mechanical set up as a replacement door bell there needs to be a diode in line to complete the full digital chime. Blink ignores this and and when you ""set-up"" the Blink door bell it makes you think a digital door chime cannot provide ""Wired Power"" so you have to run the Blink door bell on battery power.

31,Keex,The doorbell case would not lock in place with the mounting bracket.,  When assembling the doorbell I was not able to get the doorbell housing to attach to the mounting bracket. I could not find a YouTube video that might help. When I went to Blink site I saw several other complaints about the same issue.  The latching mechanism is a flimsy plastic pressure plate that broke in two when I attempted to attach it. I think a redesign is needed so the doorbell  can be securely attached to mounting plate.

32,Caitybug,Advertising is Misleading - Unit Runs Solely on Batteries.,"  I'm sending this back and very disappointed with Amazon's advertising team. They make it sound like this can be used as a wired installation leading the reader to think that is what powers the unit. NOT true. As I dug into the installation, I discovered the batteries are actually the sole power source for the unit, whether wired or not. From their instructions on the website, it states, ""Batteries are always the main power source, even when the Blink Video Doorbell is connected to powered wiring from an existing doorbell system.""This means there is no way I will see more than a few months on the batteries where it's in the main traffic area for people coming and going. I use a blink camera now to monitor the door and batteries last maybe 6 months with minimum video lengths, low lighting, and restricted zone setting outside the door area. Super disappointed that this isn't disclosed more clearly.To Blink: WTH were you thinking when designing this product to run on batteries at the entrance to a home?

   I pre-ordered this doorbell as I have many other Blink cameras and wanted to stay with one system rather than mixing different brands/apps. When the doorbell arrived I didn't install it right away, but waited until I had time (11/20/21). I easily got the doorbell to sync and hardwired it to my existing doorbell, screwed the mounting plate to the house, but then the unit would not snap to the mounting plate. After struggling for over 20 minutes just trying to get it to snap together, I finally unscrewed the mounting plate and tried to snap it together on a hard flat surface and no matter what the mounting plate would not snap/connect with the unit.I contacted Blink support by email and they responded within 1 day. However they said the mounting plate needed to be on the wall and I explained that it was mounted on the wall. In the meantime, Amazon sent another one and I boxed up the original to mail back.The second doorbell mounting plate and unit still will not snap together either - the same issue as the first one. I've read other reviews of people having issues with this same problem. I've tried all the tips others have suggested and to no avail. The mounting plate does NOT snap together with the unit. This is definitely a design flaw.While trying to get the camera to mount several video clips happened to record (motion detected) - the quality of the video looked pretty good, but without the unit snapped to the mounting plate it is not a functional doorbell.I will be boxing this second one up and sending it back as well for a refund.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2021"

37,t as in tom,Great Value,"  Bought this over a Ring because I have no desire too have multiple apps for the cameras in my house.  Figured it'd be a ""great value"" Ring, since Amazon owns Ring also but Im pleasantly surprise by the quality. FYI, the wedge for an extra 25° of angle or tilt is already included in the box. I bought with the sync module 2.  I have many Blink minis and Blink cams in and out of my house. The picture quality of this is on par with any other Blink cam and it gives a door notification when someone rings it. I have mine hard wired using the existing wires for my door bell. When I ring the the Blink it also rings by door bell ringer inside my house just like I wanted. To my knowledge the Ring Brand cams dont do this unless you buy a separate speaker. No extra speaker needed here. I cannot speak if you just use the battery only operation. I doubt their be any way to use you're existing door chime unless you hardwire this. Hard wiring is easy, their is no polarity since it senses it automatically.  As far as the final mounting to the base on my wall, it is tricky. I see a few reviews on here just about how hard it is to clip onto the wall or saying its defective. You definitely need a bit a finesse to get it to pop/lock in to the base plate on the wall but its snug. Also it has a security key like things you have to use to remove so someone can walk up and easily snatch it off your wall.

   Ordered Oct 15 and received Nov 9.  Works great with my existing 3 camera system.Mounted it over the original doorbell on house.  Tried to get it to work with the house mechanical chime, but would not work.  It is a rented house so I'm not going to delve into why. Yes, it was hard to mount in, but got it in a few tries.  While installing we had to take it down a few times but were able to get it back in the slots and ""lock"" it in.  Should be fun to do again when the batteries die.Press the button and it chimes at the doorbell.  A second or 2 later I get alerted on my phone, my 2 echo dots and my echo show 5.  Video is good day and night.  In my opinion it is the same quality as my 3 cameras.Having never owned a doorbell camera I don't know if this is normal.....sometimes twice a day the blink app will alert me about a video from my doorbell.  It is a video of stills taken throughout the day anywhere from 5 to 20 seconds long.  Just weird to me, but interesting to see.I am happy with my purchase and would buy again (especially if they fix the mounting issue).",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2021"
39,Ashley,Just a headache. Updated review,  Updated Review.Pros.1. Blink has by far the best customer service. Very responsive and easy to contact.2. Excellent price3. Integration with other Blink camera products4. Alexa integration5. Flexible settings to fit most needs and installations.6. Ability to use existing doorbell wiring.7. First doorbell defective. Did not detect motion.Cons.1. Mounting bracket is a nightmare to work with. Very difficult to secure camera to included mounting bracket. Plastic is to thin and flexes preventing proper attachment. How the unit slid over the mount to attach is NOT intuitive. Tip: Watch the installation video. If you need longer screws make sure screw head does not stick out as this will also prevent camera from attaching to mount. Use only the holes pre drilled on the bracket. This issue is known to Blink and I believe they are trying to come up with an updated mount to address all of these issues.2. Some setup instructions are not clear.3. I was not getting any motion detection from the camera. Customer service determined the unit was defective and sent a replacement. No issues with replacement.Tips:1. To access all features use with sync module which is not included. If you already have Blink cameras it will connect to your existing sync module. A battery only setup with no sync does not allow you to view the video feed unless someone rings the bell.2. If you are attaching to a home with Vinyl/Aluminum siding the camera may not sit flush. Consider purchasing a Blink doorbell wedge mount. You can also purchase a corner mount which tilts the camera in. I ended up buying the wedge mount and a Vinyl siding surface mounting block.3. I did not initially think my camera was getting power from the home wires as when I did attach it without batteries in it did not power on. You initially set it up with the batteries and need to scan the QR code on the back of the camera. I thought my home transformer may be an issue even though it meet the requirements listed. After you do the initial setup and install the camera go back and do the setup again where it will ask you about the wiring. There are additional setting in the camera menu concerning the home wiring option.

40,C.B.,Not a solution,"  Mounting is near impossible. Live view works when it feels like it. Tech support is horrible. I have never had to call Tech support 5 times in the first 30 days til now. Camera is hardwired in yet they tried to tell me the batteries were dead, in only 20 days, fine, new batteries (lithium) installed, 2 days later, batteries dead again... seriously? Wait an hour and suddenly the batteries are fine. I feel like I paid to work out the problems for them. I would love to see how many returns Amazon is getting for this junk. Wait a couple years, then maybe purchase.* update: After getting another one because Blink said my first may have been defective, I used it for 1 month and it worked fine, then after that, it all hit the fan. Stopped working almost completely, it would only detect motion. You could ring it to your hearts content but the only one that would know it was ringing was the person pushing the button. I have had 2 of them now that has failed and the only thing in common was outside temp dropped below freezing. It's a shame since my Blink outdoor cameras work fine. The person I got at Blink Tech support ran out of ideas and instead of admitting anything, he tried to blame my ISP, I mean really? Everything else I have works fine except your doorbell, which I might add, I also have a ring doorbell that works fine, yet the problem is with my ISP.

41,Dani Robinson,Design Flaw in the Mounting Hardware,"  **** Updated!  After Blink saw my initial review, they reached out to me and sent a replacement.  I was able to install this one and it seems to be working as intended.  There is some lag time, but that's to be expected as all of the Blink cameras do the same.  I'm still trying to figure out how to make it work with my Echo Show.  It says it's connected, but it doesn't show on the Echo Show when someone rings the Doorbell. Maybe that feature isn't available yet?  I would really like it to be so that my girls can view it when they are home without having to have the app on their phone.  I'll be curious to see how long the battery lasts, but that will take some time before I can say anything about that.  I wish I could have wired it, but my house is a much older house and didn't have wiring available.  I will say I was extremely impressed with Blink's customer service and Haitham who reached out to me to make sure everything was working as intended with the new device.Original review:  Super disappointed. I was extremely excited to get this and try it out, and I got it all synced with my system and tried it out and it worked great! Unfortunately, the back piece that is supposed to be mounted to the wall that the doorbell snaps into didn’t work.

Take you’re time and don’t rush the setup out of excitement. I can see what others are saying about struggling to get the doorbell attached to the plate but really it was not very difficult. Just apply a bit of pressure and push down. The doorbell should go right into place.

45,rkybronc,Updated review after Initial Mixed Impresdion,"  UPDATE: I’ve had more use time with my Blink Doorbell Cam and I’ve now updated my previous review from a 3 to a 5.  As you’ll be able to read from my initial comments below, I had some issues with the Blink Doorbell generating chime audio sounds to my iPhone when the doorbell was rung.  However, the problem was not due to the Blink Doorbell but rather, the issue stemmed from the design of my Apple Watch.  Blink tech support proactively contacted me in regards to this issue, and have worked with me to understand the issue further.  In the meantime, Apple has provided a workaround in which I control from the Apple Watch App Notification settings, which iPhone apps I wish to have notifications sent to the watch.  By unchecking the Blink app notification setting, I now am able to hear the doorbell chime notifications from my iPhone.In addition, I’ve since become aware that I would be able to have the doorbell chime from Alexa capable devices.  So after testing the doorbell integration with a Echo Show, and an Echo Dot, the doorbell chime audio is no longer an issue now, because the doorbell chime echoes in several rooms along with my phone.And in the case of the Echo Show, I’m actually able to see video of who is at the door when someone depresses the doorbell or if I’m simply interested in what that strange noise was out front.Prior to switching over to the Blink Doorbell Cam, I had been using a first generation Ring Doorbell, and the performance on the Blink is a lot better.As a result of these events and associated results, I am now able to give the Blink Doorbell 5 stars and I can definitely recommend it to others.So I’m a longtime supporter of a Blink Cameras and they work so well, I thought I’d try their doorbell when it became available.  It’s a well made product physically, made of good quality materials.  You need not worry about that aspect.  It in terms of design, I have mixed emotions after setting it up on my door and using it.The first thing I noticed at night was that the night vision is almost useless for my particular home.  This is because like many homes, my front door is recessed into the front of the house a bit forming sort of an indented area.  As such, that’s where my front door light is located and it illuminates my front door area real well, with light bouncing off the walls.  With all that light surrounding the camera, seeing through it for nice vision is impossible.  What you wind up seeing is just a blackened area beyond the lighted door area.  I’m sure Blink engineers designed a great night vision camera for use in perfect conditions, but turning my front porch light off at night to allow it to work properly is just not an option.  So point number one.  If your door sits in a well lit area, consider whether night vision will work for any doorbell cam should you buy one.Second point.  I didn’t realize this when I bought the camera, but to date, Blink offers no way to connect the camera to a external chime accessory.  I knew this going in, but my results where mixed on the usability of a doorbell cam only chime audio, plus the ability to chime through my iPhone app.  I thought that would be ok.  After all, I have my phone with me all the time.  But the chime would not sound on either my iPhone or my wife’s.  We worked with Apple to understand why and we found out that if a user owns an Apple Watch, by default, when the watch is being worn (and is unlocked via it’s PIN), the iPhone will not play the Blink doorbell sound because the notification goes to the watch instead.  And when the watch sounds the Blink notification, it does not have the ability to play the doorbell chime sound.  The only notification you’ll receive is the standard “ping” sound that all notifications (regardless of app) plays for Apple Watch notifications.  So in effect, if you own an iPhone AND you’re an Apple Watch user, recognize that you won’t be able to hear the distinct doorbell chime audio on your phone when wearing your watch.  As far as the sound that does play from the door, it’s loud enough to hear indoors most of the time, but if you’re out in the backyard, you probably won’t hear it.  NOTE: I don’t want to write more of a novel than I already have here, but if you’re interested in understanding how to send the doorbell (and any other notification to your phone even while wearing your Apple Watch, contact support and ask them how to turn off notifications for specific apps in the Apple Watch app, to prevent them from going to the watch and forcing them to play on the iPhone).This brings up my 3rd point.  As far as i’m able to tell, the Blink Doorbell is only able to play the 1 audio chime that comes with it, if you opt NOT to hardwire your Blink Doorbell to an existing doorbell chime wiring.  We no longer have doorbell wiring, so I was happy to use the Blink Doorbell’s chime, but I was hoping there was an option to play a variety of chimes from the doorbell.  Sadly, this does not appear to be the case.  It’s not a showstopper for me, but that would have been a nice feature to have.As far as the app is concerned, if you’re a Blink user, you know that the Blink app is pretty good as far as features.  The one feature we like is the ability to “tune” where the camera has visibility to, to tone down false alerts from cars passing by.  For battery life on the Blink Doorbell, I can’t say yet if the battery life is anything like the Blink cameras, but I’m extremely happy with the battery life on the cameras.  I believe Blink touts up to a year.  I think I have some cameras that have not required a battery change for 8 months now, but this is dependent on motion sensitivity settings, camera video recording duration, etc.  So your mileage may vary.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 30, 2021"
46,rkybronc,think/plan before you buy.,"  make sure you plan/investigate before you purchase this bargain. as technology goes, this integrates well into my blink system. That's where the good things stop.  If you have an older (mid 80's) house that was pre-wired for a doorbell with a recessed conduit box as a mount, you are in for some work and modifications.(see image2) my original doorbell button was mountd on a permanent conduit box where the wires come in from behind.these conduit boxes have industry stndard mounting screw holes for face plates. the design engineers of this unit weren't thoughtful enough to make the pre-drilled mounting holes on the  back plate to correspond with conduit screw holes. this will require modification of the back plate by drilling a small hole so it can mount on the existing conduit box. In addition I had to use the old faceplate to cover the opening of the conduit box, which looks like crap at my front door. (see image 1)  The only other fashionable option would be to  make a wood plate with a hole for wires that would have to be drilled and mounted to conrete (in my case).  After all this work my existing indoor chime does not ring when the button is pushed. it is wired correctly and i tested the circuit by bridging the contacts on the back of the mounting plate with a screw driver and the indoor chime rang. after attaching the camera unit to the back plate the indoor chime does not work. I have made sure the camera unit was snapped flush to contact the contacts on the back plate.  At this point I'm too disgusted and frustrated to dis-assemble the unit and do further testing. Luckily i have multiple Amazon devices throughout my house Show/dot etc. to know when the camera is activated. so if you think this is an easy $50 add-on device you better plan ahead. Obviously I am handy, but it will run up a bill if you have to hire someone to fashion a remedy.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2021"
47,MD,Don't buy! Spend the extra 10 bucks and get a Ring.,"  Have an existing Blink camera system that I don't hate so I figured being able to use the doorbell in the same app would be a bonus and the price was right. Unfortunately it doesn't work. I followed the in app directions and installed it wired, unwired, and finally just sitting a couple of feet away from my router and sync module. It would connect to my app. The app would tell me it's battery was good, it's sync module connection was strong, it was armed, night vision was on auto, etc. The thing was it would never take a video, you couldn't do a live view or take a picture. the door bell button didn't do anything but occasionally flash red. The in app view showed a Grey window. Figured it was defective. returned it for a replacement. Same issues.  Would not work. You can't just do a normal return either. You have to call a multilingual, probably highly educated, service representative that has the  unenviable job of walking a bunch of grouchy cheapskates like myself back though the installation process to make sure you did everything right before they concede it probably doesn't work as expected. I was very nice as I imagined the horrors they must endure on a daily basis. Amazon of course took it back. I got a refund I'll use towards a Ring.

Hopefully the same issue does not happen again.Updated on 11/26/2021: Blink customer service was able to rectify my problem by sending me a replacement unit. The new unit works well, but still takes some effort to close the cover if you are not planning to mount it against a wall. The customer service representative who resolved my issue was very attentive and took notes on my feedback. I hope and encourage Blink to design future doorbells in order to provide a better customer experience. In general, the software, the camera, and the sync module work very well. There is some latency, but it does the job. The video quality in general and at night is decent, but don't expect to see minute details very well. The microphone does catch wind noise and there is a constant white noise sound. I appreciate how the cloud can save up to 60 days of video and the USB storage is convenient. The data files are not too large, so a 64 gb can last a long time. I've used the doorbell camera for a little less than a month and only 3% of data was used in my USB drive.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 30, 2021"
49,RJ Smith,Falls short of the most basic expectations.

If I happen to have a video home assistant like the echo show, then even better! It would immediately pop up with a live view showing who is at the door and allow me to talk with them.Disappointingly and to my utter shock and dismay, the blink video doorbell does none of those things.NONE OF THOSE THINGS ARE POSSIBLE!What, Amazon and the Blink team, are we supposed to do with this then?

50,VictoriaR,Cannot be installed flat against surface,"  I was excited to purchase this product because of the reviews and the quality.  Disappointed that I could not mount the backing plate to the wall without causing a bulge in the middle due to the wires coming out of the wall.  Because of the bulge, I could not mount the main unit onto the backing plate.  As expected, a tab broke off when trying to apply a ginger amount of pressure.  If it did go, it was only a matter of time before the main unit would pop off and prevent from doing its job.  Very poor engineering by not allowing enough room for the doorbell wires.  Something tells me there wasn't any or not enough product testing before sending to market.  Typical nowadays.  Unless you have a spacer between the back plate and the wall, I would not recommend this product.  I guess for the price, you get what you pay for.Update: 11/10/21I increased the stars to 3 because someone from Blink @ Amazon took the time to reach out to me, provide technical support and a new product to try again.  They’re taking this serious and that is hard to find these days.  I haven’t installed it yet but it does look favorable so far.  I will update again once the install is complete.  Thanks for the effort.  That alone is worth it to me.Update: 11/13/21Installed the doorbell today with the wedge.  Install went like it should.  Every doorbell should come with the wedge when purchased.  It provides the necessary space for the wires coming out of the wall.

51,DR ice Mind,Now my Blink system is complete,"  Finally my Blink cam system is complete. It took a long time for them to complete the doorbell but it seems like time was well-spent. The slim doorbell camera provides an exceptionally wide view of the whole area in front of the house.  Night vision is very good and as usual with Blink products everything is in the package.  So far my cameras theat I’ve already installed are doing well with the 2 lithium batteries AA in each and I’m amazed at the life. My prior doorbell camera was powered by slightly larger AA type batteries (2) and required weekly replacement which although they were rechargeable was a total pain in the butt. I stopped using it and when I saw Blink doorbell was about to come out , I preordered one and got it sooner than predicted. My outdoor cameras which use the same AA lithium batteries have been running for at least 2 months on the same batteries.  The guides say the batteries should last approximately 2 years , which remains to be seen , but they still show power level is ok and if necessary to replace any that have more activity sooner it is not difficult nor expensive to replace. I bought a 48 pack of Bevigor brand AA lithium batteries on Amazon for about $1. per battery and they are advertised as being better than the Energizer batteries as far as their leakproof design and I will review them once I start using them. I was impressed with the ease of adding cameras and doorbell to the smartphone app and the cameras have many reasonably priced accessories for mounting in different places and ways. As far as my research has shown: Blink cameras seem to be well designed and live up to their claims. Most people who’ve had them longer than I have are stating that the battery life is holding up and the new design uses either cloud storage at a monthly charge and/or a sync2 system that accepts up to a 256 GB thumb drive for local storage which makes the cloud storage unnecessary and saves us from paying monthly charges. There are many different packages or each item can be purchased separately. The usb storage device is less than $30. if bought separately plus the cost of whatever thumb drive you use with it. So far I have all 5 star ratings for the system and the accessories purchased for mounting were inexpensive and provided clips for hooking cameras to vinyl siding, clips for hooking tightly to sheds/trees/windows or anyplace with a spot to clip it, they also have accessories to provide 25-30 feet of electrical cord which can be used instead of batteries and they also make electrical powered Blink mini-cams which are good for small offices or rooms. I’ve even seen solar powered outdoor lights with a spot to add a camera to and I expect new items to be coming out as thought of. System is relatively inexpensive and can be started small and added too as finances allow if you cannot spend the $400. or so for a well equipped system. The cameras hold up well to weather in the northeast and are hearty little devices. As you see , I cannot say enough about the Blink system and I’ll add one more item. Amazon has bought the company and has everything available on their site.

52,EDL,So much potential ruined by horrible mount,"  First, I am a big fan of the Blink ecosystem. I have 5 cameras with 2 more on the way. I've been patiently waiting for this Blink doorbell for a while now.Let's get the bad out of the way first: the mounting system. IT'S HORRIBLE! Whoever designed this mounting system should be fired. It's seriously that bad. I tried for nearly an hour to get the doorbell to connect properly to the mount but could not succeed. I read numerous other reviews giving tips on how to do it properly, none of them worked. I put just about all of my strength into making this doorbell ""click"" onto the base to securely fit and could not make it happen. What this ended up with was a fit that did not look weather proof and it certainly wasn't thief proof. Just a little bit of upward pressure was all it took to disconnect the doorbell from the mounting plate. Terrible.The image quality of the camera is decent. It's nothing amazing, but it's not the worst it could be. For a $50 doorbell it seems about right for the price.Maybe I got a faulty doorbell? Who knows? I do know this mounting system is one of the worst things I have come across on an Amazon product. I wanted to like this doorbell so badly but the entire thing is ruined by this awful mounting system. It's unbelievable nobody noticed this during development.Returned for refund the same day I received it. Just not worth the aggravation.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2021"

The ONLY complaint I have is that after dark you cannot see the doorbell.  Once the button is pressed it does light up.  However walking up to the door the blink doorbell does not have a light to show you where to press.My old standard old school door bell was backlit so you could find it.Blink has a multicolored light around the button, and I have it hardwired to power so why not back light the button blink?

   Installed it an within 3 days someone took a package off my front steps I would have never knownOverall pretty good.  Easy to set up wired or wireless.If you want wired you will most likely need to get a new transformer for your current chime bell. If wireless you will only get notifications your currently wired bell will NOT chime inside your houseVideo quality is good, even night vision.  What they need to improve is when the camera picks up motion.  The attached video you don’t see him open the gate BUT yet I get alerts when a car passes, so they need to fix that.  They do have the ability to deactivate zones but even when I have zones deactivated I still get notifications.What I would like to see as a improvement1.  The camera tilt up and down and left to right2. Improve software so when the bell is pressed I can get a chime on my phone in real time.I already have 3 blink cameras so I was adding this with the upgraded sync moduleI would recommend this product",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2021"
55,doogie_esq,Slow response on the local module and quick battery draining speed,"  Update after 1 month of useThe system stay okay when I was in free trial for blink cloud subscription. Even though the response speed is way slower than its competitor. It takes about 5s to open the live view and 5-10s to retrieve a cloud clips.And it's even worse when you go for local storage option. For me, the local module didn't record any motion detected at first. And after number of reconnections, it's then magically start working.And it's far slower to retrieve a clip from local storage than retrieve it from the cloud. (as Blinks Q&A, it depends on your local wifi condition, mine is 200mbps downstream/10mbps upstream, but still, it takes me over 30s to load a 15s clips)And another issue is with the battery drainage.Even if I power up the doorbell through the chime wire, the battery still drain fast when you turn up the detection sensitivity. I set it to 7/10, and after replacing two brand new Duracell, it prompts a 20% low battery warning the next day.And when the battery is low, it will comes up more problem. For example, longer response time for Echo/Alexa alerts(sometimes not response at all), system busy alerts will show up more frequently. The cold outdoor temperature might be a reason(around 36 F at night), but draining 80% of battery in a day is not acceptable especially when it's already powered through the chime wire.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2021"

57,fxsales,READ THIS FIRST!,"  Great camera for the price I’ve been a blink fan for a few years now and use several of their products. I most recently bought a sync module for this doorbell which I’ll explain shortly. OK for starters it’s a great camera it does what it’s supposed to and has good video quality and sound quality. I don’t know about night vision because I haven’t used it mine is set up in a constant lit hallway. Now what most people aren’t understanding is if you don’t have the sync module you cannot live view. You can only live view if motion is detected or if your doorbell is rang without the module which is the bare minimum. So short answer yes it does work without the module just limited features. I used my doorbell without the module with limited features for about two months just fine. I caved and got the sync module because I live in an apartment building and got a lot of motion alerts and needed a bigger storage and wanted to live view as well. Second the sync module and the Blink subscription plan are not the same thing, think of it like this the subscription is paying for extra cloud storage like you would with your iPhone and the sync module is like a homebase for your cameras where you can back them up to a usb drive and it gives you access to other features such as live view(doesn’t apply to indoor cameras). I don’t know why it’s required for live view because I didn’t need it to live view on my indoor cameras but I didn’t create this product so I don’t know. Also if you buy the sync module after the doorbell camera you have to delete and re-add your doorbell for the live view to work. I experienced this myself and had to call blink trust me. My advice is pay the 3$ a month and buy the sync module. It’s worth it and it’s the cheapest home security your going to get at this quality with 24/7 support. PS. I have a lock box on mine it’s worth the money btw that’s why it looks like that.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2021"

63,Justin M.,Just Another Camera - Not Recommended,"  The installation is ""difficult"" but that's only due to the 6 flimsy tabs on the backplate that hook into the doorbell.  Mine came with 2 tabs broken but I got it to hook on anyway.  The camera on the doorbell is the same quality as any of the cameras and has an impressive field of vision, gotta be like 175 degrees or so.  The chime is fairly loud on the doorbell itself which doesn't make sense, the person already knows they pushed it.  However it was barely audible inside a quiet house so the wireless option is a big zero in my eyes.  I don't have a wired doorbell so couldn't test hooking it up.  So my phone (with the Blink app) would ping a notification that the doorbell camera sees someone there, but that's the same as any of the Blink cams.Three things they could do better is 1) give the app a chime just for the doorbell that works when the doorbell button is pushed.  2) make the backplate stronger with an easier installation (connecting doorbell to backplate).  3) the Chime on the doorbell itself could be toned down a lot, you can hear it across the street.  And finally 4) have a wireless chime for inside the house to make the wireless installation worth anything.I ended up deciding to return mine 15 minutes after installing it.  Without a chime on the phone app, and not being able to hear the chime inside the house, it's just another cam so useless as a doorbell (again, just the wireless option).  I was all excited to see a Blink doorbell because I love their camera and have several around my property, but it's just not for me.Blink should offer a in-home wireless chime that sounds a tone when the doorbell button is pushed.  If they offered that with the doorbell I might have kept it.  If Blink has one, I couldn't find it on Amazon or on their Blink website.I do NOT recommend this doorbell - at least not in it's present state.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2021"
64,Justin M.,Great functionality but the back plate could use a redesign.,"  Update: 12/03/2021I ordered another blink doorbell on sale for Black Friday.  I put the door bell on my back door.  I did not want to drill in my brick so I purchased some outdoor industrial Velcro.  My backyard is fenced in, so there is less chances of the doorbell being stolen.  I really wanted the back door doorbell for the camera function.  It is hard to attach the camera to the back plate unless the back plate is mounted.  The way to resolve this issue is put the back plate on the doorbell and push up from the bottom with a flat head screw driver.  Once this is done yo can you Velcro to mount the doorbell.  I would not suggest mounting the doorbell with Velcro if you live in a high crime area or you think the doorbell might be stolen.I was a blink customer before Amazon purchased the company.  I have been waiting for this blink doorbell for over 3 years.  It is finally here and for the most part I am pleased.  The functionality of the camera is excellent.  The only issue I have is the back plate and the hardware for installation.  The back plate that comes with the unit is universal for wired or wireless.  If you are using wireless the doorbell does not sit flush to the wall.  I used some outdoor double sided tape to make it stable and flush.The screws that come with the unit are too long.  I used a shorter screw but the head was too big and it hit the batteries when I tried to install the doorbell.  When I replaced the screws with a smaller head the doorbell installed easily.  Before I figured that out it was a nightmare trying to install the doorbell to the back plate.Here are some needed improvements for the blink/ amazon team:  1.  Have 2 back plates.  (1 for wireless and 1 for wired)  2.  Have a wireless chime so when the doorbell rings you can hear it through out the houseOther than that this is an excellent product.  I wish Amazon had released it 3 years ago when it was supposed to come out.Update:  11/04/21There is an option to announce on all alexa devices in your house that the door bell has been pressed.  You go to devices in your alexa app an choose cameras.  In cameras locate the door bell.  In the door bell settings turn the announcement feature on.  In my opinion this is just as good as having a wireless chime when some one presses the door bell.  I have also noticed many people having trouble with the back plate.  If you use your own screws make sure the head is small especially on the bottom screw.  If the screw head is large it is impossible to attach the door bell to the back plate.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2021"
65,D. R. Wheeler,Good If You Can Get It Mounted,"  Does anyone at Blink actually install this stuff? Like I get the firm impression that no one at Blink / Amazon has ever held a drill in their tender, soft hands.The doorbell and camera system work as expected. Inexpensive and mostly just work. Just like most Blink products.But like every Blink product since before they were bought by Amazon the mounting and install system is terrible. I installed the back plate as demonstrated (wireless mode) and the doorbell wouldn’t attach to the mounting plate. Spent 15 minutes trying to attach it to the plate with zero luck.Took the plate off and started screwing with it. Noticed that the soft plastic was essentially bent a bit (e.g. warped) and that the doorbell couldn’t clip in unless the plate was very flush.Took the plate and a power driver and smashed that f’er flat to the door trim. I probably stripped out the screws doing this (that’s another persistent issue with Blink’s engineering — they always include the softest, cheapest screws) but managed to clip the doorbell in this time. How I am getting it off if / when I move? No clue.From a tech perspective, works great. But Blink needs to hire some actual craftsman to work on their mounting system. It’s a a persistent issue across the product line but this doorbell is the worst. I swear no one at Blink has ever touched a hammer",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2021"
66,ERIK,Sometimes motion capture skips frames,"                    The media could not be loaded.
                




   Update: Blink support contacted me shortly after leaving this review about the frames skipping. They think it's the batteries and are sending me new ones free. They said they will replace the camera if the batteries do not fix the issue. They also said this camera does in fact use a PIR sensor like the wireless blink outdoor camera for motion detection which is good news. It means bugs won't be attracted to it or trigger a needless recording event.Sometimes the recordings skip frames at the beginning of the motion event. Live view also doesn't work 50/50 percent of the time. It says ""live view failed."" The saved settings for IR also mess up a lot across all of my blink devices, not just the doorbell.Regardless, I bought a second one for the back door since the Black Friday deal started and they're dirt cheap. I'm hoping a firmware update can fix these issues at some point.Something tells me the infrared stays on 24/7 for motion detection at night which means bugs will be attracted to it and set it off continuously. The blink mini I have outside does the same thing and I have to turn off notifications for it because it's so obnoxious. The outdoor wireless version doesn't have this issue because it uses a PIR sensor instead for motion detection to save battery life. I don't think the doorbell has that. I imagine it will chew through batteries constantly if you aren't able to hard wire it to your existing doorbell to power it that way instead.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2021"

I did not have a problem attaching it to the base that others had, but the base is very flimsy. The Ring build was much better but also cost 4x as much. I had to make sure that the Blink base was completely flat as it’s tendency was to bend against the stucco. I also had to push the tab at the bottom from the back to get it to snap together. It did not require a lot of pressure, just perfect alignment. Picture quality is good and app works as expected. Not sure how it will work when the subscription trial ends as the website is confusing in regards to how it works with the sync 2 module. I got this rather than a new Ring so I would have local storage rather than using a cloud subscription plan.

70,Sam Bowen,Very nice addition to my Blink system,"  I’ve owned Blink cameras for over two years now, and for the most part they’ve worked very well, and have excellent battery life. The video doorbell is a welcome addition. Setup and configuration was straightforward; physical installation took about 5 minutes; no issues or problems. Integrates nicely with Alexa, with a variety of standard chimes and sounds, plus a bunch of seasonal sound choices as well. I’m a renter and couldn’t mess with the existing doorbell, so i covered it with a Knock Nanny (which I bought on Amazon). Installed the Blink doorbell on the door fame right next to it, 4-1/2 feet up from the porch floor. Even if someone is standing only 2 feet from the door their face can easily be seen in the video. Within the app, I moved Motion Detection Sensitivity down to 4, which triggers the camera at the ideal time when someone is approaching. I’ve had a couple false triggers from passing trucks, so I may lower Sensitivity another notch, or possibly set some Activity Zones if it becomes an issue. My only complaint is the loudness of the doorbell sound at the unit itself. It’s nice that pressing the button generates a sound, because that confirms to the person pressing it that the doorbell is actually working; but half the volume or less would suffice. Overall though, I am very pleased with the Blink Video Doorbell.Update - 11/15/2021: Configured an Activity Zone (actually an inactivity zone) within the app to block out an area of the road from motion detection. (The road is about 40 feet from the doorbell).  Ever since I made the change, I haven’t had a false trigger (over a week now).Update - 12/18/2021: Had a false trigger after previous adjustment so I removed the inactivity zones entirely and set Motion Detection Sensitivity down to 3. No false triggers in the past three weeks, and valid motion still triggers video recording well in advance of someone reaching the door.

75,Vanessa,Zero Stars - BEWARE - Sync Module Local Storage uses Cloud,"  I purchased Blink Doorbell together with the Sync Module and a Mount/USB Thumb stick. Blink is sold as using local storage; but comes with a 30 day cloud free trial.The set up was easy - (1) Install Blink app on your phone; (2) put USB Thumb stick in the Sync Module, and then plug the Sync Module into wall; (3) follow directions in the phone App to connect to the Sync Module; (4) put batteries into the Doorbell, and follow directions in the phone App to add device to the Sync Module.When the phone App dialog got to the point of signing up for a cloud subscription, I immediately exited. For privacy I only ever want to use local storage, and never cloud.  And that was fine.  The doorbell worked - it detected motion and made video recordings I could see on my phone, and had 2-way audio from the phone App.  And, it APPEARED to me that I was using local storage, BUT, I WAS NOT - I WAS BEING DECEIVED - I had automatically been set up with cloud functionality under the 30 day promo.  This is deceptive, because I had been testing the device using cloud functionality, not local storage. The performance I had been experiencing was cloud - and SHOCK!!  video footage of my family was being stored in an Amazon cloud, and I have no way to track who has viewed that footage (and who would trust whatever tracking info the cloud service provides anyway?)People want local storage for privacy, and do not want cloud service providers to be able to view their camera footage.  Oh, I'm sure Amazon will say that the video is encrypted and can only be viewed by individuals with special access and a court order.  Whatever!After 2 weeks, I noticed that deep down in the phone App account settings there was a link to cancel the 30 day free trial.  Well, I thought I was 100% local and not using the 30 day free trial, so I had to try the cancel link to see what happened...Immediately the App reset.  Now when I view video recordings there are 2 tabs: Cloud and Sync Module.  All my recordings were on the Cloud tab, and the Sync Module tab was EMPTY!  So, apparently my videos will live on in cloud storage for 60 days (though I can manually delete them - which is more likely just hiding them in the App).So, I made a few more video recordings.  When I try to view them I get a message ""We're retrieving your clip. Hang tight, USB clips take a little longer to load.""  It seems the clip on the Sync Module gets uploaded to the cloud, and then displayed on your phone.  AND, MANY TIMES the clip will not load.  So, the whole Sync Module Local Storage option is an ineffective & inefficient waste of time.Finally, I found that the phone App could not delete clips on the USB thumb stick.  So, basically the USB thumb stick will eventually fill up.  (Very slowly, it would take more than 1000 standard video clips to fill 1GB,  and the USB stick will be 64GB or 256GB)  Therefore, at some point you will need to eject the USB stick and do some mass deleting.  I ejected the thumb stick from the Sync Module, and looked at the contents.  It still had COPIES of videos from when I first set up the device, and which I had deleted BEFORE hitting that Cancel 30 day Free Trial link (even though the phone App does not show them!).",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2021"

In fact there is not a completely flat surface anywhere between my door and the brick wall. And the old doorbell wires are in this ""not flat"" space, so that is really the only place I can install it. Tried installing anyways but the doorbell won't attach to the mounting plate because 1) not a completely flat surface, 2) limited space between wall and door jamb, 3) terrible mounting plate design that makes it virtually impossible to get doorbell to click into mounting plate.

79,David W,"Nightmare to install and then it went offline, grrrr...","  Frustrated, frustrated, frustrated. I installed my new doorbell without wiring on a flat surface following the instructions and video. I lined up the doorbell module with the plate and no amount of effort on my part was going to cause the two pieces to join together to give me a working doorbell. The doorbell is well protected by a porch.I had to wait till my son, a professional AV install technician, could swing by and complete the task for me. Less than a week later the doorbell has gone offline during our second Nor'Easter of the season. The solution to get it working again involves removing the doorbell module, the batteries (to power cycle the doorbell) and putting it back together again. ARE YOU SERIOUS???BLINK knows there is an issue connecting the module to the plate. They sell a separate spacer to correct for that. Why not include it in the product? Maybe you could engineer the face plate better so a spacer isn't needed? Or perhaps you could let people know up front that they may need assistance getting the two parts to connect if they're over a certain age and don't lift weights on a daily basis.Other than that, it works great.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2021"

   I had this doorbell installed 2 days ago & after making adjustments to my settings on the Blink Home Monitoring app & Alexa I am surprisingly happy with my purchase. I already own several on the Blink Indoor cameras my for kids room & my living room entry way, so I expected expected there to be a 5-10 second lag in video display but after connecting to my Alexa app things started to look up. I live in an older house so the doorbell that's already installed sometimes goes on the fritz so I decided to install the video doorbell right above the existing one wirelessly & I was unsure of how getting alerts or hearing the doorbell was would be possible, but I ended up setting my Video Doorbell to a high sensitivity level (which will definitely mess with the battery life) so it alerts me of any movements but I have since decreased the sensitivity since then. As far as the lag goes it does not effect anything especially while the doorbell is armed it records as soon as someone approaches the general area or touches the doorbell & immediately starts recording. The 2 way talk is always a plus. Overall the camera & quality is awesome & I would recommend if you are looking for a cheaper video doorbell with good quality!

The video quality is pretty solid, especially for the money, in my opinion. There are cameras/doorbells considerably more expensive with similar features and video quality. I think Blink could have sold this doorbell for $99 without too much trouble.As others have stated, the mount is very questionable. I don't know how it could have been released without people thinking ""this mount is a problem"". Connecting the camera to it is very much 50/50 between hoping it is secured on and that you aren't about to break the mount or the camera. I think Blink will find a way to remedy this issue.I did the hardwired installation and ran in to an issue with it not ringing my doorbell chime in the house. Called Blink support and got someone on the phone immediately. They accessed my Blink app and maybe did an update/setting change because I reinstalled the doorbell on the app and everything worked great.Blink, fix the mount issue (and work out something to remedy the issues for those that already bought them) and you'll have a solid product I think.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2021"

Batteries died in this current cold snap, not a problem even if they were energizer lithium, as we know batteries have a hard time in the cold.  However, popped off the bell as directed, replaced the batteries and popped it back on.  The next time the door was closed the bell fell to the ground along with the broken bits of the clips that were supposed to hold it in place.  In the fall, the spring that holds one of the battery contacts secure also failed.

87,Smarthome Enthusiast,Good and Bad - Update,"  I'm having mixed feelings about the Blink Video Doorbell. This is my second video doorbell, and the Blink is considerably different from the first one (another brand). First, the box is a beautiful thing to behold, but somewhat challenging to 'unlock' without destroying it. Second, I expected written instructions. All of the instructions were delivered by the app. Of course, I did things in the wrong order, and had to undo and redo. The video quality is remarkable, even on a phone screen. The camera shows quite a panorama, which is excellent for the location I chose. The notifications tell me exactly when something moves in the range of view (and I can block some areas).  I do get a notification every time there is movement, which can be annoying.  I thought I could correct the problem by making longer recordings, but there doesn't seem to be any reference to that in the app.The doorbell is a recent acquisition, and should Blink reach out and answer my questions, I will be happy to update this review.Update: And indeed, Blink did reach out to me, and offered a solution that should resolve any issues that I might have had.

When this was announced I preordered it.  I did arrive a week later than originally planned, but supply chain issues, etc.  Installation was quick and easy and it works well with my hardwired doorbell.  Video and audio quality is great, as it night vision.  If you're familiar with Blink cameras, you will have the same control over the settings for the doorbell that you would for any camera.  For me, the biggest feature is to include the doorbell and cameras into a single app, which is why I hope to see more products from Blink introduced.The only very minor downside is that I was sent coupon for a free corner mount so I could mount the doorbell at an angle.  The corner mount was only offered in black even though the camera I ordered was white.  From the angle one walks onto the porch and approaches the doorbell from, you don't see it, but it would be nice if they offered the corner mount in the same color as the camera I ordered.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2021"

   I love the overall doorbell. It picks up movement, as you can see in the video. It's affordable, and the quality is good.The drawbacks:I had to replace the batteries within a month of use. It has been pretty chilly here, so I suspect that is the reason why. I also got about 30 notifications a day.The next day after I replaced the batteries, it stopped detecting motion and wouldn't give me notifications. So I paid the monthly subscription fee ($3) and it started working again. Please note that I still had 10 days left in my trial.Please mark my review as helpful if you found it to do so. Have a good one.UPDATE 12/21/2021:Once again it stopped working. It won't even give me notifications of movement. I'll definitely be returning and spending the extra money on a ring.

91,Samantha Jochem,Has the basic features expected and performs well so far.,"  Seems to work as expected for those that need a battery powered doorbell (also able to be wired in). The storage feature being USB is neat although there is not an included mount. It is a box with a usb charger that will otherwise dangle off your outlet unless you have somewhere to set it. I managed to double sided tape the box to the charger so that it is ""mounted"" to the outlet. Works well enough.As for multi-users, this does not seem possible in the sense of multiple accounts. My solution was to use the one account created to login on all devices that wanted access to the camera. This seems like a silly missing feature, but forgettable in the scheme of things.The doorbell itself seems to be of decent build quality and has a nice aesthetic to it. Nothing super fancy, but definitely functional for the price.Image quality is decent. Not the best I've seen, but absolutely not the worst. Same with sound quality.The software has a few short comings. Past the multi-users issue I mentioned, the lack of quick responses like most other smart doorbells have is disappointing. Or the ability to set auto responses upon detection.  It does sync well with Alexa and my dots make the noise expected when the button is pressed. It just seems under baked for such a prominent companies offering.A good buy so far, but solely for the price.

   So I use 8 Blink outdoor cameras around my house, for both security and keeping an eye on my dogs.  While the Blink cameras are not the highest quality cameras you can buy,  they are adequate for my needs.  They are slow compared to the Ring cameras, especially when connecting to the Blink app on your phone so you can see live alerts immediately. But they are also a lot cheaper! It's also cheaper for the subscription plan,  choosing me $10 a month for unlimited devices to backup to the cloud.  I also use a USB memory stick with the Sync module for local backup.So wasn't expecting this doorbell camera to work as well as it does.  I was worried that it wouldn't work with my wired chime from the old doorbell. I disconnected the old doorbell,  then attached the two wires to the mounting plate for the Blink doorbell, easy so far.  Then I screwed the mounting plate in.Before mounting the doorbell, add the batteries to the doorbell camera and add the device via the Blink app. Just scan the code on the back of the device to add it quickly.  Mine synced in less than 30 seconds.  Then follow the install steps.  The wired chime inside your house and alerts on any of your echo devices will not work until you go through the whole setup in the Blink app. Took me a while to figure that out! Once I completed the setup in the app, pressing the doorbell activated the wired chime inside the house. Then the Alexa app on my phone told me the doorbell was available on the Blink SmartHome skill. Clicked the link for that and it showed you to set the doorbell camera to chime on your echo devices and you can even change the sound it uses. I have echo devices in all of my rooms,  so that made it even better!Now the quality compared to the Ring doorbell cameras is not the greatest, even at the highest settings but it is more than adequate for me. The Ring doorbells (at least the newer ones) have a wider angle lens that sees more but as you can see from the video I posted it works great fur what I need.  As I have 3 Blink cameras also watching the walkway to the door, and the driveway, in covered.  If all I was doing was using a single doorbell camera, I would have went with the Ring pro.Battery life: All Blink cameras include a set of Energizer lithium batteries.  Depending on the settings for your Blink cameras, including the doorbell camera, the battery life can vary heavily.  Blink says they can last for two years.  Well that's not gonna happen under any real world scenario! Some of the things that eat battery life the most... setting quality to high. I use medium in all my cameras. The video length for recording also can eat up battery life, as can IR intensity set to high.  I find low to medium actually looks better on most cameras. I will have to experiment with the doorbell camera to see how long batteries will last.  Most of my Blink cameras will last 4 to 6 months.  I bought the solar mount for two of the cameras in high use areas as I was replacing batteries every month abs they were mounted up high and wasn't convenient to replace batteries in those cameras.I have read forums where people use rechargeable batteries and they work fine,  even though Blink says not to. Probably a deal they worked out with Schick Technologies to get better prices on batteries.  😄 Personally I dont care for rechargeable batteries, as it is just one more thing I have to keep track of. I bought a large stock of lithium Energizer batteries from Amazon and rechargeable batteries will never last as long.

When I had no subscription I could record all motion videos to my USB drive. Not live views. Now, with the doorbell and the free 30 days, I can record live views but it’s stopped backing up the motion recordings to the drive as it had right up until the moment I installed the doorbell and started the new 30-day trial.

97,JOSEPH BERTRANI,***UPDATED*** not so great,"  ***UPDATE***Doorbell suffers from the shortcomings of the software and its design. I have my doorbell wired. The device will not function if batteries are dead/no batteries installed. This is ridiculous, what's the point of having the thing wired if it won't even ring the doorbell. I can understand not recording video, but for the thing to not work at all?! It fails at its most basic task. As for the software portion, once they get the recording zones function out of beta and implemented successfully it might reduce the amount of power drain due to the amount of video that is recorded. If you're thinking about buying this and its mounting location will look at a high traffic area (high traffic walkway, looking at the street, etc) wait to buy until the software gets finalized or the next version of this comes out.*********Ive been waiting for Blink to come out with a doorbell since they initially released their cameras. I pre ordered first chance I got. I have several blink cameras already, a couple of the full size ones and one of the finicky smaller ones. I had a Ring and wanted to replace it with a blink device since I already have the existing devices.I had hoped it would be better than the smaller indoor cameras and as good as their larger cameras and I was pleasantly surprised. pictures/video is good quality and I have not noticed any issues with it. The doorbell itself is louder than the Ring doorbell I replaced and does not have any issues working the mechanical doorbell that's in the house.Installation was simple/straightforward. I did not have to use a wedge so I did not come across any of the issues that others had encountered with that. Locking the device in place was a bit difficult as there was not a lot of travel to slide the device into place and little to no audible snap indicating it was locked. Had to pull on the thing to make sure it was locked in place and didn't come off.The real issue came with setup. Once the device was installed and added to my system, it needed a lot of settings adjustment to get right. I have my device wired so battery drain wasn't an issue but I can see why people were showing low battery shortly after installation. The door bell motion sensor kept activating every 5 min or so and recording. Once all the settings were dialed it worked better than the existing cameras. There was also a review that stated video wasn't recording, and that was probably due to the setting being off. I had the same issue but figured it out. The doorbell has different settings than the cameras and video recording has to be enabled towards the bottom of the setting screen. This is probably off to start in order to help people save battery at the start.The Blink system itself still has its issues: time limited clips, 10s re-trigger time for video recording, long delay in live view, and delay in video viewing. These all existed in the blink system prior to the doorbell so these are nothing new. I think these are built in to keep the cameras from overheating and preventing filling up cloud memory. Just things to keep in mind if you don't have a Blink device yet.The doorbell does what it supposed to do. Rings the bell when the button is pressed, detects motion and gives notification if you have that setting on, and records motion/doorbell rings when recording video setting is on.

101,Megafreakintron,"Nice picture, great integration with smart home systems","  Oooooh, how bad I wanted to give this a great review.  However.... First the back story. I don't like paying fees to monitor my own home. I'm tech savvy enough that I've installed several security cameras without ever paying fees. I buy open source devices and manage them on my router. But I digress...  I initially had a Skybell because they were the only ones on the market without having to pay monthly fees. The Skybell's picture was beautiful and again, no fees. But there were instances where the app took a long time to open a video stream and sometimes not at all. Plus, it didn't have any smart home integration (Alexa). Which brings me back to the Blink video doorbell. It was on sale a few months back, so I thought I'd try it out. I already had a couple of Blink wireless cameras, which I only tried because they were on a great sale as well. To be clear, the Blink system, much like most of the security cameras available are p2p type cameras. Meaning, you have to use the app from the camera company. And you cannot view them using a pc.  One thing that made the Blink system stand out was the Sync Module, which acts like a mini router, or hub of sorts. There is the option of inserting a usb thumb drive so to save videos and pictures locally and not just the cloud. The cloud is why there are fees btw. So, the monthly fee is optional to not only view the cameras, but to play back videos. All this sounds great, right? Well, when trying to view the doorbell, as well as the wireless cameras I already had, there is an exorbitant amount of time to open a video stream. I mean, like 10 seconds, which may not seem long. But when someone is waiting at the door... I never thought it would take so long to open a video stream. I spent time on the phone with customer service, ran several tests, and the only thing they came back with is that because my router is dual band, the doorbell was having difficulty navigating the airwaves filled with both the 2.4ghz and 5ghz band waves. What whaaat?  The router system I have happens to be the eero mesh router system...another Amazon company!  The eero unfortunately does not offer the ability to split the 2 bands, or even turn off the 5ghz, which I made sure to complain about to the eero folks. So, this whole long review to say that I'm unfortunately going to have to go back to the drawing board, swallow the cost, and find another option.

102,Amanda,Best and most flexible video doorbell for the money - Hands down!,"  For under $50, this is the best video doorbell going.  You can wire it to your existing doorbell wiring and have it ring your electro-mechanical or electronic door chime or you can go totally wireless.  It's up to you.  Setup is easy and if you have an existing Blink account, it is added like any other blink camera.  Video quality is superb (better than the other Blink/XT cameras I have).  If you have an existing free Blink account with the original sync module, you can use your free cloud storage so there is no monthly free.  If not, you must pay for cloud storage, use it without a sync module or purchase a sync 2 module and you can store to the SD card if you want to avoid the monthly fee.I opted to wire mine to the existing door bell wiring and the installation came out great.  There are a few downsides to this doorbell but it is still the best option for most people.  The doorbell uses battery power even if hard wired so don't loose the special tool for removing it as you will have to replace batteries periodically.  Like other Blink cameras, you can't do continuous live views.  When you live view, you will get a ""Continue"" popup every 25 seconds.  If you don't press continue, the view will stop.  Alexa integration is not reliable but it works flawlessly with the Blink app.  You can set all the usual things for the motion detection like activity zones, privacy zones, sensitivity, clip length, resolution, re-trigger delay, and you can set the recording to end when motion stops even if clip length has not elapsed.  When someone rings the doorbell, you can talk to them via your phone even if you are not home.  The system has the features of the more expensive ring models at a fraction of the cost and the motion detection is better.If you have been considering a video doorbell but have been on the fence, pull the trigger on this one.

   I have been looking at video doorbells for a number of years, and have always found a reason to hold off buying them. Part of my reasoning is I already have Blink XT2 security cameras, I already have a number of Alexa devices, why would I want to add one more infrastructure to my smart home environment? Then I saw that Blink finally released their version of a video doorbell and it was able to connect to both the old Blink sync module (I have one of the old ones and have one of the free 2hours storage accounts pre-2020) and the newer Sync 2 modules, as well as connect to Alexa to do a number of things.Let's start the with basics. Installation is pretty simple, they even include a template to mark the wall for drilling and mounting. Two screws to mount the bracket to the wall. I also used a 30˚ bracket in addition to the standard back plate which comes with no directions but it is pretty simple to figure out. The system will allow you to connect to existing doorbell  (16v - 24v) wiring if you have an existing doorbell chime, which I did not. Once you have the back plate mounted you can then hang the doorbell. NOTE: Do not mount the door bell until after you have added it to your Sync module and your Blink app since you will need the barcode on the back in order to join it. Adding the doorbell to the mount does require you apply pressure towards the back plate, and then slide it down about 1/32"" to lock it into place. There are a number of reasons for this, including there is a gasket between the doorbell and the back plate that is there to keep moisture out, and you need to compress this while you slide it into place.Once you have it up and running you can add it to your Alexa devices using the Blink Skill and use any Echo to work as your doorbell chime. I originally enabled them all realized that it made sense to only have a few of them respond when the doorbell is pushed because it was very jarring to have every room in my house blasting with a chime and the announcement of ""Someone is at Your Front Door"". Also if you have an Echo Show you can preview the doorbell, and any of the other cameras on the display screen.Overall the video and audio quality is good for what it is, and the Android app works perfectly with the devices. It is easy to view recorded interactions, and download the files from the cloud to the phone. After installing this at my house I also added one with a Sync 2 module at my girlfriends house, and she loved the benefits of having one, which all prompted her to have me add two more security cameras.I would highly recommend this system, keeping in mind the following:- You need to have a Sync module to make this actually work because of how the video is accessed.- You do not need a preexisting doorbell chime and transformer, but if you have one you can hook into it.- If you do not have a doorbell Chime can use an Amazon Echo device to work as one if not you will only get the notifications on your phone.- No mater how you hook it up, you will need to have the batteries installed to power the camera, and currently there is no way to hardware and power the system even if it is hooked up to a doorbell transformer.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2022"
104,Adam W,Local storage not working,"  I've been using 3 blink cameras with local storage (and no cloud subscription) for several months now with no issues. I installed the video doorbell on 10/29 and things initially worked fine (motion detection and recording to the free trial cloud subscription and to local storage). The next day, I cancelled the free trial as it wasn't needed and things seemed to be working fine. From that point on, the doorbell's motion detection and recording no longer worked. I could do everything else: live view, take a photo, change settings, answer a doorbell ring, but motion detection and recording no longer worked.I took the doorbell off the mount and removed the batteries to perform a ""hard reset"" but no luck. Email tech support was useless. After going thru basics like changing the recording clip length and 'are you sure motion detection is enabled?', I ran their special app to troubleshoot network issues.  Their recommendations were to disable the router firewall and to give separate names to the two frequency bands on my dual band router.I told them I was not going to disable the firewall as this was a basic security issue and besides, the 3 blink cameras had been working fine for months with my network configuration (and continue to do so).Having read in AnInSe's review that all videos first go to Blink's servers before being transferred to local storage, I believe there is a bug on the server side that prevents videos from going to local storage if you cancel the trial cloud subscription.**UPDATE**Three hours after posting this review, my doorbell's motion detection and recording started working after having been inoperable for three days. I did nothing on my end to fix it. I did not disable my firewall or set up separate network names for my dual band router as tech support had recommended. I had just left it mounted and running, hoping that it was either a firmware issue in the doorbell or a server side issue that Blink would eventually fix. Apparently they did.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2021"
105,Amazon Customer,High Praise,"  I don't wanna praise it too high just yet because I have only used it for couple weeks. Easy to set up by following simple instructions. I hard wired it but initially it says to insert batteries. After that it doesn't say to remove batteries or not so I left them installed. I would prefer that the scan code also be put on the box it came with incase I had to reset in the future. You will have to pull it off the wall if you ever have to scan the code on the back of the doorbell.I tested it on my doorbell wire and received a warning that the voltage was too low. My thinking is that a lower voltage is better than too high of one so I left it hard wired.Alerts early enough and almost too sensitive. I think the sensitivity can be adjusted on your phone app. I set it up to my Alexa through the Alexa app and home security feature. I can't see a constant picture display like on my other blink cameras (just a blank screen) but when I open the app, video will turn on and also when someone is at the door. A signal is sent to your phone first.I can answer the door through my phone but it makes a high pitched sound and tough to understand. If I tell Alexa to "" show my doorbell"" the TV turns on and doorbell video can be observed ( I like this feature).  Alerts go off alot at night so I put it on silent or turn off. It catches all the passing cars on my street. Night vision is ok as most cameras only display black and white but I can still make out who or what is out front. You get a cloud account to try for 30 days and is compatible with your existing blink system. I will use a USB stick when my trial is over but I have not had a drop in signal or any problems with it since I installed this item. I recommend this to anyone since I have enjoyed it so much. Great item to purchase for Christmas. One last point is that I can not adjust the volume on the doorbell chime but I can have it in sequence with my hardwired chime.

106,Jeff M.,Beats the Ring by miles,"  We had a Ring video doorbell and after 14 months of constant problems, finally decided to go with Blink. I should have done so 6 months ago, as our Blink security cameras have been flawless for 4 years, only changing the batteries every 20-24 months. And Blink customer service is amazing, vs Ring not so much.The Blink doorbell integrates into the Blink security system flawlessly and, unlike the Ring, can be scheduled on and off, whereas the Ring only allows scheduling motion detection off. The Blink installs easily and will ring the mechanical doorbell with the button press. I really like the innovation where you can match the doorbell transformer voltage to the Blink and thus get either a single chime or the familiar ""ding-dong"" sound at each button press.Sensitivity is very good day and night, and video quality is also very good. I have to admit the Ring appeared to have slightly better night video quality, but also did not have the ability to adjust the IR illuminator like the Blink does. I will adjust it to high and see if that improves the video.Installation is easy, and I used the corner bracket to improve visibility toward the front steps as the doorbell wiring is on a side wall. Setup is also easy and the Blink app guides you through the installation. If you have a Blink Sync Module for other cameras you do not have to purchase a new module; the doorbell will run off any other sync module you already have. You can run up to 10 devices off one module, although we do use separate modules for certain cameras to have the flexibility to schedule them individually rather than in groups. Plus if your previous Blink system is ""grandfathered"" as ours is, there is no annual fee for cloud storage. Even at the $30 annual fee, it is no more expensive than others.I am very pleased with this doorbell. It is a great addition to our home and security.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2022"
107,Kindle Customer,Misleading marketing material and underwhelming video,"  I purchased the Blink video doorbell to replace another video doorbell that offered a similar feature set and local storage.  Having owned a similar doorbell gives me the ability to compare and contrast basic features.Video quality:I was disappointed with the video quality, especially if zooming in on an image, as the image gets grainy.  Even when unzoomed it just does not show the level of detail that my previous doorbell did (picture for reference)Field of vision:This has more of a wide angle lens, so if you have a wide entranceway this may be beneficial.  However, I personally prefer the fisheye lens that my previous doorbell had, as it allowed me to view if I had any packages sitting on my door step (picture for reference)Notifications:Although the app can be unreliable with showing badge notifications, the push notifications showing motion detection and a doorbell push are almost instantaneous.Visibility of doorbell:This was a disappointment, as the marketing material that shows the blue light ring constantly lit is extremely misleading.  The blue light ring only lights briefly when the doorbell is pushed and does not stay on constantly.  Perhaps this is for the purpose of saving battery life, as the power is solely received from the batteries regardless if you also have it hard-wired.  However, I would at least like to have the option of keeping it on all the time for visibility so my wanted visitors know it's there to push and my unwanted visitors know they are being recorded.If Blink is willing to read customer reviews and make some hardware and software changes, I'd be happy to re-visit my review with updates.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2021"
108,RH,Spare yourself-do not buy. Technical issues for some and abysmally bad customer support.,"  I’ve spent almost a month trying to get the two doorbells and camera that I purchased to work properly. The pros:1. Integration with Alexa is seamless2. motion detection works well if the doorbell is installed at the right angleCons (and they are numerous):1. They’ve used the a chip that responds to both 2.4 and 5G although the doorbells will only work on 2.4. What does this mean? If you’ve got a router that will not separate your 2.4 and 5G bandwidths into different WiFi networks, you’re screwed. For example, if you rent a newish router from Spectrum, one of the largest ISPs in the country, you cannot set up two separate Wi-Fi’s. The doorbell will become confused, working sporadically but not fully. In my case live view will not work nor will the option to speak with visitors (or package thieves). Yes, I saw that the blink system only works on 2.4. However I have several other things that only function on 2.4 and do so with no problem. Furthermore, the fact that it only functions on 2.4 is only listed if you click on “technical details”. The description should be clear that since Blink used cheap chips that respond to both 5G and 2.4, you have to be able to separate those bandwidths in your home for it to function properly.  Be aware, the tech support reps will tell you that “of course you can separate them on the router from Spectrum” as though you’re an idiot for saying you can’t. Nope. You CANNOT and spectrum cannot. Some newer routers do not have that capability.2. They are not clear on everything you will give up if you choose not to subscribe to their cloud storage. Makes the gadgets significantly less useful and feels very much like bait and switch.3. Image quality is pretty shoddy, but this may be a function of the device being confused and trying to function on 5G.3. Customer service and tech support at Blink are PROFOUNDLY inept, disinterested, lackadaisical and occasionally just plain rude. I spent 5 hours between Blink and Spectrum tonight trying to make this system finally work. For the record, they are not available 24/7 because they’re too busy. You’ll get a VM and a hang up if you request tech support. You’ll need to keep calling and punch the option for new set up. Don’t expect them to act at all apologetic for reneging on the 24/7 statement.After multiple call attempts, Rep 1 repeatedly told me to go to the settings to subscribe to their stupidly expensive $10/month plan, seemingly incapable of understanding that I would first like to see if the doorbells can be made to function correctly. I said it 3 times. It’s not a tough concept.Rep #2 also had a listening problem. When I asked her to please stop interrupting me (so she could fix a problem I actually had rather than one I didn’t), she just hung up. Nice.Rep #3 sounded like he was answering the call from bed and insisted I was wrong and that Spectrum could separate the 2.4 and 5G. He said rather snottily that other customers hadn’t called saying it was an issue. Um yeah….maybe because they lost patience and returned the piece of garbage? He also felt the need to inform me more than once that the listing says 2.4. Really? Take a look at the Amazon listing. ONLY if you read the technical specs.Lastly, I’ve been on with Blink customer support at least 8 times. Why is it that none of their reps could solve this over the course of a month and a Spectrum tech support guy had to be the one to explain it? I now have a choice of installing a new router that spectrum won’t support if the internet goes out or returning these trashy devices. Not a hard choice. Other makers of wireless video doorbells use chips that only respond to the one frequency. I’ll replace it with one of those from a company that hopefully knows what it’s doing. I am furious at the incompetence and rudeness displayed as well as poor quality of this product. This company is a nasty joke that’s wasted hours of my time. Bit surprised they’re owned by Amazon. Why on earth did they buy Blink and why haven’t they cleaned up this joke of a company?",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2022"
109,CST,Very pleased.,"  I read a lot of reviews before purchase & install… so I expected problems with the mount, wiring to existing chime, and adding to existing pre 2020 blink system. Ironically it took me longer to “make” a wooden adaptor for my door trim than it did to physically install the device. Some key things I learned along the way (1) when adding to your existing system, add the doorbell to the system assigned to the sync module, this will be the group with your other XT or XT2 cameras(my legacy cameras). At first I added a new system within the app and named it “doorbells” as I planned to install 2 of them. Within the app my new “doorbells” system was not linked to the sync module so the device was in “event response” mode (press the doorbell to save changes etc) and had limited features. Once I switched it to my “outdoor” system along with all of my other sync module cameras everything worked as desired. (2) I voltage tested my 2002 existing door chime at 19.8 volts and wired the blink doorbell with no problem… but then the chime would not activate after pressing the button… yes, you need to use the app to finish the install. I had skipped the mount and wiring step to install it in the app first upon delivery the night before… Once I followed the steps in the app everything works as expected. (3) the mount works well but does require a firm flat surface (numerous reviews are not wrong). Since I wanted to use existing wiring that was run thru the door trim, I pieced together an adaptor with some scrap wood to make a flat surface. Gently position the doorbell over and slightly above the tabs on the plate, press against the mounting plate and slide down. An audible click lets you know it is locked in. While trying to get the chime to sound inside… I removed and replaced it several times with no problem. Also, despite the app indicating “external power” the batteries are required (as numerous reviews indicate). Also the blue ring only illuminates when pressed (again the reviews are not wrong). I was hopeful that motion would cause illumination, but no go. Too bad… maybe a software update will resolve this? Everything I read about the “photo capture” function indicates you need a subscription… yet I had a camera roll video this morning identified by the blue “camera” icon in the clip roll on my original sync module system… unknown if the video clip was actually hourly snapshots as the camera was facing down on the coffee table all night… will see what happens tomorrow.Update 12/13 the Photo Capture feature does work with the doorbell in the pre 2020 system (original sync module).",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2021"
110,Charissa,Impressive if you follow the directions!,"  So after waiting an EXTRA long time to get the white Blink Video Doorbell, I set out to install it in place of my existing doorbell.  I already knew I had a low voltage system so no worries there.  Doorbells aren't complicated.  It's a simple switch that closes a circuit to trigger the ringer.  Blink allows the installation in a wired or wireless format. The wireless install is no different than any other Blink camera.Installation was pretty straightforward but getting the mount to ""lock"" into the doorbell took some persuasion.  There's no positive ""click"" feeling when the mount and camera are fully seated.  After hastily removing my old doorbell button and hooking up the Blink, I didn't understand why it wasn't working.  Lo and behold, during the initial addition of the Video Doorbell to your system hub, there's a walkthrough on setting it up.  I skipped that because I got interrupted by something else (squirrel!) and didn't realize it was an important step.So once I was sure everything was mounted correctly, I went into the Video Doorbell settings and configured it for a powered, mechanical chime.  The doorbell firmware did its thing and got everything working correctly.  Very nice, Blink devs.The video quality is exceptional and it's super wide angle.  The motion sensitivity is great and it catches cars going by over 50 feet away.  Night vision is excellent.There is some delay on the talk/listen feature, however.  I would argue that it's almost unusable but will hold out judgment until I've used it a little more.  It is, however, clear and very functional.Amazon provided a coupon code for the wedge mount because it wasn't included with the first run of these units.  Thanks, Amazon.I had been tracking this for what seems like years and I'm happy Amazon/Blink finally released it.  I'd argue that it's the pinnacle of my ten camera Blink installation.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2021"
111,KritikSS,Read reviews BEFORE installing— make sure screws on mounting plate are tight/plate does not wiggle,"  I’ve had multiple indoor and outdoor Blink cameras for years, so adding the Blink doorbell made the best sense for me.  In addition to added security, I was interested in the ability to know who and when someone was at the front door as I can’t hear folks knocking from the upper level or back of the house.I’m a very handy person who requires little instruction to figure things out.  This thing had me puzzled for about an hour as to why it wouldn’t simply click together.  It’s clear from the design how the parts are to connect… but they don’t just snap together for testing or confirming you are assembling/installing correctly.Initial installation of the doorbell left it barely in the mount and ready to fall off with the slightest touch— obviously not ideal for how a doorbell is used. Just before I was ready click the send button for a product complaint to Blink (they provided excellent service with a camera issue in the past), I did some research on Amazon reviews.  The one that says something like “read this first” helped me solve the problem.Part of the issue was that I had left just a little bit of give in the screws to make it easier to remove the mounting plate if something was wrong with placement or installation. 1) The screws to the mounting plate must be tight!  When you are ready to place the doorbell into the plate, 2) look at the plate from the side (if possible) to help line up the back of the doorbell with the small cleats on the plate 3) hold the doorbell slightly above the cleats 4) push hard towards the plate and down to lock the cleats in.  There isn’t a tell tale click sound… but when it’s in there… you will know because it is definitely tightly affixed.So far, it’s working very well.  The only other thing I would add is to check the view the doorbell provides before you install it.  Check to make sure there are minimal to no obstructions so you can maximize the security features.  Also look for options that give you the view you need.  For example, if you’re wanting to keep an eye on packages on the front step, you may need to place it a little lower than you might think to.Like my other Blink products, adding the doorbell to my system and the rest of the installation process was easy.  Having an older home and not wanting to spend hundred of dollars on wiring…I appreciate the ability to place and move these cameras wherever I need to with the non-wired options.  Overall, I’m happy with my purchase.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2021"
112,KritikSS,Just about worthless. *Edit - update below *,"  *Edit* Updating this review since the doorbell automagically started working the day I went to uninstall it. Right before I took it off I told myself to try it one more time and lo and behold.. it worked. Tried it several more times and it has worked every time. I had made sure it was up to date with it’s firmware and software as soon as I had installed it, so I know that wasn’t what fixed it, but something happened and now it seems okay. Also, someone from Blink saw this review and contacted me to see if they could assist, with I was glad to see, but didn’t need their assistance since it apparently fixed itself. I’m going to leave this as a two star rating for another week or so just to be sure before updating it to 4 stars.Original review-  Just installed the doorbell and everything went smoothly. It added to my system no problem. Build quality looks nice. It detected my voltage for the mechanical chime and rang the bell without an issue. Great! So far so good… until I actually tried to use it. I press the button and get the notification on my phone almost immediately. When I tap the notification though… it takes me into the app and shows me a spinning gear…. Forever. It never goes to a live view. It never shows me the recorded view. It just spins. Endlessly.After I exit the app, I can go back in and select live view and that works great. But it NEVER works from the notification when someone presses the button. It’s “busy”.  This is a terrible implementation and I can’t believe a company like blink has this sort of problem. I tried to email them about it but “ran into an error” when sending the email from the support link.

113,SierraPrimeShopper,"Wait. For a while, or forever. This is not the doorbell you're looking for.","  Let's start with the obvious reason to buy this doorbell: Integration with the Alexa ecosystem you already have in your house. For me I have Echo's, Echo Show, Blink Inside/Outside cameras(6 total), Halo Fitness Tracker(not really connected but still Amazon).Out of the box, batteries in, connect to the blink app-easy. Scan a bar code and good to go. Get a warning about having a Sync Module? No problem I have it.Doorbell ""No you don't"".Um..yes I do, all of the cameras could tell you the same.So first red flag is it refuses to acknowledge my sync module.  A handful of powering off module, router, camera in different combinations-it finally seems to see it....ok first 40 minutes gone.Next remove the Ring doorbell that's hardwired in with no issues in a full year of use to wire in the Blink doorbell. ""Your transformer doesn't seem to be compatible"". Hmmm...double check the fine print, specs, requirements..yeah-yeah it is. Ok, kill the breaker, unhook, re-hook, breaker on...nope...Hook the ring doorbell back up(requires the exact same power as Blink)-works fine.Ok...so poof bang pow(get the blink wired back up, reset router and sync module) ""your transformer is perfect! way to go big guy"".Alrighty...Alexa app shows video, Echo Show-video check. Neat.Now for the purpose...ring the doorbell...crickets chirp...So 60+ minutes into it I go back through all the settings, test chime works fine, bell chimes on the doorbell itself, but not outside the app or the doorbell. Triple check settings...Echo's enabled as chimes...Reset router, sync module again...and again.75th time is the charm! It finally works....kinda? 90 minutes in...The shortest latency period I could manage was 43 seconds from doorbell push to echo notifications.Go ahead...hold your breath for 43 seconds...see if you're hanging out at my door that long before I even know you're there.My sync module, wireless router, anything that matters are all centrally located in my home, over 150mb speed even at the heaviest of streaming/download times. My Ring doorbell has zero issues. It does everything the Blink camera does(but actually does them). It only requires me to have an extra app on my phone.Save your time and hold off until Amazon wants to ship a functioning doorbell.(Before jumping to conclusions on my level of interaction with support staff....yes all the power up/down/unplug/plug-in, reset app, delete doorbell, hard reset module, is what hoops you'll be jumping through).",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2021"

I wanted to love these & just a as door bell cam GREAT but other wise no I'll tell you why,"  I previously purchased 2 rings at a deal & had finally got them programmed to catch movement on the street etc. I sold the home & left them as agreed. I was trying to be cheap & purchased blink instead. the clips are so short & pretty much right at the door, you have to go ring the bell for any change to take effect - annoying!! It says if not it takes 24hrs. I made some changes & have had no movement since 430p yesterday.  Also they are hard to open/close for batteries (2-AA lithium only) The ring it so easy to attach & charges with a cord. I never bothered with the security screws, I just lift it off to charge & stick it back. I was considering  calling support to see if I can work out some issues but I think I've talked myself into definite return instead. Also show announces it by its long serial# vs what I have it named and it knows the name.. Motion at hfydytdtudduduktdk-321654654vb so annoying! lol.  If you need something at this price point budget , its worth it for $39.  Put one on the back door too. You may have to get creative to hang it because its like a childproof pill bottle but worse because you cant get the lid back on either. If you have extra funds go w/ring.

115,Douglas,Total Dud,"  I bought this to replace a hardwired doorbell, wanting the visual deterrence with no actual monitoring.  A ""video"" doorbell is visible before walking up the driveway, unlike a fake camera.1) The Q&A response I received that the blue light will illuminate when hardwired, with no App setup needed, is false.  My doorbell wires measure 18.6V, which should be fine according to the documentation, but I get no blue light and no doorbell chime.  I suppose it's possible my Blink doorbell simply doesn't work.2) I can't get the box to snap onto the back plate, so even if #1 weren't an issue, the one I received wouldn't actually be usable.  (I pushed the box snug against the plate to test functionality.  The contacts should have been making full contact as such; I simply couldn't get the lower tab to snap in place.  Very cheap design.)3) The tiny plastic tabs that lock the box to the back plate do not feel like they'll last through many removals (if using batteries instead of hardwiring), especially in an outdoor environment with temperature swings.  Consider this typical disposable goods from you know where.4) The packaging was designed for, or perhaps by, someone who enjoys unboxing videos way too much.  No one needs that many complex little cardboard flaps to untangle.5) The included instructions don't mention the key card thingy, but the online instructions say, ""A paper template is included with your doorbell to show where the mounting holes are placed. The template is shipped with the doorbell opening key attached.""  The paper template is of no use, as the backing plate does the same thing.

116,TG,Reconsider!! Has Many Shortcomings,"  Unfortunately, I am not impressed by the product so far.  It has many shortcomings that make it a useless product.Issue 1:  The iPhone application does not provide an audible chime/sound/alert when the doorbell button is pressed. The only notification provided is a text notification.  So, if you are not looking at your phone's screen, you will never know that somebody just rang the doorbell!!!Issue 2:  There is no chime add-on device available from the company.  The only option is to use an existing chime device from your wired doorbell.  This defeats the wireless installation.  Our hose never had a wired doorbell. So, this along with the previous issue I mentioned makes the product useless.Issue 3: The camera coverage is very bad.  I am not sure how the product website shows a picture of packages on the ground.  I have installed the video-doorbell directly on the front door at the height of about 4 ft above ground.  In this installation, the camera's field of view does not show anything within the 4 feet from the door. So, any packages or objects left closer than 5 ft from the door will not be visible by the camera!!! If I manually tilt the video doorbell at 45 degree angle, I can see from 2 ft away from the door. Using the optional wedge bracket is not going to be helpful either.I hope the company addresses these issues and provide better information on the limitation of the product.Good Luck.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2021"
117,Jim,So close but such a headache.,"  I order this under preorder before reviews came out. But I did read the reviews about bad mounting over the last few weeks before it got here but kept my order today. I was hoping I would get one without the issues or with my background in Tech could find an easy fix...I can build computers and repair just about anything, But I was wrong. Sadly this product is just not ready for market. The like the software, app, and even the camera on this doorbell however the mount is the biggest miss here. This doorbell would get an easy 5 stars if the mount on the thing worked. After drilling holes and mounting it next to the front door the doorbell won't go on the mount no matter how you try it. I tried every other way to get this to fit into the hooks. Nope... If I wasn't so lazy I would return the product however I rigged the mount with double-sided tape and mounted it with command strips. Hopefully, it will hold and no one will try to rip it off. I really wanted to love this product.Update: I added another Star because the Company Service is great! They reached out to me to offer me a new mount once they are made. So I am looking forward to them sending me a new mount for this item. They really want this product to work and their service says they are willing to do what it takes to fix issues. The network went down once that created a lot of issues for me for two days however I understand those things happen with Technology. I still really like this doorbell and even ordered one for my father for Christmas. So far he seems to like it too.

What will I do then?It really could have, and should have been designed better.Also, the unit still can't capture far enough down to see the ground, which is more important than being able to see 10 feet in the air. It really should have been angled down a little bit.So for now, I have to keep my Blink XT camera above the front door to check for packages left on the ground.---------------------------------------Original Review:  The unit comes with batteries and the ability to connect into the existing low voltage doorbell wiring. However, the doorbell won’t work with just the wiring alone. It requires the lithium batteries as well. Nor does it ring your house doorbell. But it does ring on your phone, so that part is good.It’s good that it works nicely with my Blink app where I have 4 Blink XT cameras being monitored.But something odd happened with a video capture the doorbell took, where it gave me like 12-15 scenes together of the change of daylight and nighttime over the course of 24 hours. Almost like a timelapse video. Why?Still waiting for my corner mount. Right now, I get a big column. (See pic)Also, the camera is high enough to where I can’t see the ground in front of the camera, for any packages left on the ground. I don’t need to see 10 feet in the air.Some improvements could be made in this doorbell.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2021"

   ***EDITThis thing is awful.  I can never access live view, it always fails.  I have it set where there's non trigger zones because our dogs are in view of the camera, in the front yard off to the side.  But it still picks them up so we get 100s of alerts a day of just our dogs. This thing seriously never works right.  It's so frustrating.  Even when I was able to see live view, it took forever to connect.  So whatever you were trying to look at was long gone.  It also gets triggered by any little snow or rain.  It might be that I just got a dud.  And may work amazing for other people. But as of right now with mine,  I do not recommend.***The videos pretty good and night vision works well.  But when you go to watch live view it lags and skips alot.  Sometimes just completely kicks you out.  My main two complaints is, not having separate accounts to access it.  So if my Husband and I both try to access the cameras at the same time, it won't let us.  Then it takes a while after he or I exited out for us to get back in.  And my main big complaint is battery life.  We haven't had it set up for even two months and the batteries already dead. I don't really have anything set up just the basics and a small trigger zone.  So I don't understand how a ""two year"" battery life equates to two months.  Also, I lost the key and I haven't found a way to get a new one so I don't know how I'm gonna change the batteries.  So far I'm not really impressed with it.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2021"
120,David,Does not have night vision and mounting it took OVER an HOUR,"  The color picture is my regular X2 that's at my doorstep--it is in color, has great picture quality even at night but doesn't have far sight range. The black and white picture is the doorbell picture at night, and if anything were to happen out in the street or in my yard, you wouldn't be able to see anything!  Now, you say it is a doorbell camera, so it is meant for usage at the door, but with it's wide angle, it picks up a lot of area, and for it to be most useful, it would be great if it had night vision like that X2s do.And mounting----I about took a hammer to the whole system I was so irate.  I spent over an hour messing with this thing.  I watched Youtube videos, read things online, texted my boyfriend who also just installed his (and he confirmed it is a pain to mount).  It just would NOT click on the back.  I uninstalled the back and went into the house and tried putting the back on while inside too.  Watched a video...showing to push it against a wall so you can use that as pressure to hold it still while clicking it on.  Nope--still wouldn't work.  Eventually I just pressed hard enough that I thought I might break it and it snapped on.  But then I couldn't get it off!  Yes, I inserted the tool, and it loosened the bottom clamp, but I still couldn't get the back off without feeling like it was going to break.  Eventually it just came apart.  IDK--by magic.  I ended up using a mounting bracket with it so that it would actually work on my wall outside.  I DREAD when I need to change the batteries.  All in all, a TERRIBLE design for the back.  There HAD to be an easier way to install--it didn't need to be so hard to install just to make it complicated to steal.  All you need is anti-thief precautions to getting it OFF the wall....but no barriers to putting it ON the wall!  The tool is a great idea.  Most thieves aren't that smart.  But I could have done without the hour of lividness trying to get it onto the wall.I give it 3 stars because it works, it syncs to my original module that I have free storage with and it does connect to Alexa, but I haven't turned that feature on because the first time that it wakes me up while I'm sleeping, I'm going to be upset.  So that feature is untested.  I will say even though I have the notifications on for the Blink app so I can get movement notifications, it randomly stopped giving notifications about a year ago--so I do not get the doorbell notifications either, and my house is large enough that I have never heard the chime when it goes off outside.I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO CREATE AN INSIDE CHIME BOX THAT CONNECTS TO THE SYSTEM AND YOU CAN PLUG UP ANYWHERE IN YOUR HOUSE (like the living room so it isn't right beside your face on the bedside table).  Thanks for FINALLY creating a doorbell camera though!  I was NOT going to mix and match my systems and also have RING.  Between BLINK and ADT being 2 apps to control security, I was NOT adding a 3rd!  However, Ring DOES have a chime box!",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2021"
121,Erle,Hope you want to get video of every car driving past your front door,"  Installation was plain and simple.  I didn't have an existing doorbell, so I had to go with the battery only install (my old system was an intercom systems from days gone by, and no schematic to show how to grab required power from it).  I mounted it flush on my front door, and it was detected and integrated into Alexa with almost no problem.  Then the notices of movement started...and continued...again, and again.  During the day, I have my system armed to get motion detection on my (hardwired) Blink cameras.  The doorbell camera captured every neighbor, UPS, Fedex, Amazon, and lawn service vehicle driving by.  Annoying, and figure it'll go thru batteries at a stupid rate.  There needs to be an option to only capture motion during specific hours (I'd LOVE to know if anyone were roaming around at night, after everyone is in bed, etc.) but there doesn't seem to be the flexibility to specify times for individual devices for motion detection.  It's either on for everything or not.  Disappointing.  So for now I've disabled it, and plan to write a product request to the Blink development team, which I fully expect to be ignored, about better ways to handle motion detection.  On the positive side, when the doorbell was pressed, I did get notification on the app and via Alexa, so there's something.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2021"
122,Jason,Works without a subscription,  The sales description was a bit confusing- so let me clarify : this unit can be used WITHOUT a subscription or additional speciality equipment - BUT after the 30 day free trial subscription expires the motion detector video service stops working unless you sign up for a $4/ month subscription. The video doorbell feature continues to function without a subscription.You download the app to your phone and follow 3 or 4 simple steps and it works - it connects to your home wireless router very easily equipment. . It will detect the motion of something at your door and send a notification to your phone. If someone presses the doorbell it will ding-dong on the door and on your phone - you can then ‘answer’ the door by talking to the person who rang the doorbell (and see them on the camera) via your phone. Or you could go old school and walk to the door and open it.The range and sensitivity of the motion detector can be adjusted so that passing cars do not trigger it.The additional equipment and subscription (confusingly) advertised enables the continued motion detection video and more advanced features it you need them.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2021"
123,Steve,"Great little doorbell, some quirks","  As some noted, there is a bit of an issue with the mounting plate, but that issue can be easily fixed by reading the instructions that show how to actually mount the plate.The doorbell is generally of good quality and there isn’t a sense that it can be easily swiped, although I’m sure some thugs will prove some users wrong. Video quality is great during the day and the audio transmission is good as well. Night time video is generally just ok. The glare from the cars on the road is sometimes enough to set off the ring camera alert at night, even when you set up your active zones to monitor. So lowering the sensitivity is a must.One other thing - the chime is automatically set to off meaning if you are wiring this in place of your typical doorbell, you’ll have to go into the app and set your chime after you’ve installed the doorbell. I think that should be automatically on since…well since it’s a doorbell, but who am I to judge. It’s an easy fix.Overall I’ve been impressed with all blink products and I’m happy that they’ve been making some changes and upgrades over the years.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2021"
124,Jason N.,Trash From Step One,"  Bought this in spite of the many warning reviews. Step one, connect the sync module to wifi. Result? 20 minutes of ""Sending Wi-Fi info to Sync Module"". From what I've read, it's not even worth contacting support. Returned. Bottom line? Don't bother.I bought two of these, so I decided to try the other one. Things only got worse. The back of the doorbell would not attach. Yes, even the purely physical part of this device didn't work. Called Blink support and they immediately diagnosed it as an ongoing problem with, I assume, many of the backs and they offered to send a new back. Switched the back on this with the other one and finally got it closed. Surely everything would work now, right?WRONG! After all that work, it turned out the camera in this doorbell didn't work. Called support again and after a few minutes I was told that a system reboot had been done and I was confidently assured that in 8-10 minutes everything would be perfect. It never was and it never worked. Returned!Seriously, save the time and aggravation and don't order this product.

   I was really excited to get this doorbell especially since I just moved and don’t currently have a doorbell. It arrived a few days early but when I went to set it up and put it together I wasn’t able to connect the back to it because it was sort of bent away and wouldn’t connect properly. I contacted support about it and the first thing they offered was a discount but didn’t solve the issue of not being able to put it up. I was already annoyed at the fact I couldn’t put up the doorbell but not being offered an actual solution didn’t make it any better.

126,The Toolman,Not impressed,"  I have it set up using battery.  Initially I thought this was working good.  It recorded cars driving past my house.  The recording started when the cars was about halfway across the screen.  I've walking outside and it recorded me, and it recorded me going to the house.In looking at the videos for the day, I see a car in my driveway.  I don't see any videos of it going into my driveway, the car just appears.  Then a few hours later, the car is gone.  I don't see it leave, its just not there anymore.  I ordered some food from Uber Eats.  There is no recording of anyone coming to my door, or leaving.  But yet the food was outside my door.  During the day, my porch light is off, and before it gets dark, it turns on.  So near my door, the lighting should be good.  I don't have to depend on the nightvision .  I will keep working with this, but for now, I am not impressed by it.

128,CraigC,Would have been cool 3 years ago when it should have been released...,  This is basically a Blink camera that can attach to your existing doorbell wiring but still needs battery power to function.  So the doorbell wiring will not provide power to the doorbell unit.  It would have been great if it had wired power and battery back up.  I returned mine because it was just easier to mount a camera by my existing doorbell.  Especially because the angle piece doesn't turn the doorbell enough to work for where it would have been mounted.  I love Blink's cameras otherwise and have several on my house.

129,Daniel,Need to keep an eye on security at two locations,"  I have a very love/hate relationship with this system. It’s worth the read if you have an elderly parent/grandparent. Bare with me…..Likes: I love the convenience of the system. They are battery operated so essentially if you have Wi-Fi the cameras work. The picture is great and the battery life isn’t bad even when in “alarmed” mode and utilized multiple times a day. This works great for keeping an eye on my grandma and keeping her home as long as possible. It creates a sense of comfort so I can check in on her multiple times a day and make sure she is safe.Dislikes: The cameras can have quite a bit of delay. Sometimes by the time I’m notified of someone in my driveway, they’re already out of their car and standing at the door. I’m hoping the doorbell will help with this.My biggest downside, while I know this won’t be an inconvenience or issue for most it is a huge negative for my family and I and our situation. Let me explain….My elderly grandma still lives at home. We like to keep an eye on her. So myself, my dad and my aunt all have access to her account.I like the camera system enough that I invested in the system myself for my home. Here lies the issue. I’d like to be able to receive notifications from both locations. In order to do this, I need both on the same account. When I do that, my dad and aunt also have access to see my cameras which I don’t want.  The only other option is to log in and out of each account. My grandmas account is set up under her phone number. Every time I log off I need to “verify” the account with a text code that is sent to her. My grandma is 84 and doesn’t know how to text. The other option is to choose which house I’d like to watch for the day. How do you choose 🤷🏻‍♀️I really hope that blink will look into this and create a way where I can possibly keep both accounts logged in, receive notifications from both locations and not have my dad know every time my mom (his ex-wife) comes over to visit.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2021"
130,Doc,Nice but very hard to install.,"  The blink doorbell looks very much like others. It takes a good picture and the ability to ring our existing doorbell is a plus. Connecting the camera is similar to their other products. Everything went well during the installation up to mounting the button/camera to the wall mount. It was very frustrating trying to get the unit to ""Snap on with minimal pressure"" as the directions claimed. I had to repeatedly remove the plate and remount it before I got it to ""snap on"". I was afraid I was going to break the tiny plastic clips that hold it together. This feature needs rework to make it fit better. Another issue was a ""corner"" mount that was mentioned in the install instructions but was not in the box. I think that piece might have provided a better base and made snaping the plate to the camera easier.I will update this in a month after I have had some experience with the product.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 30, 2021"

The corner is one thing, but most people will be installing this onto siding and will need a ""wedge"" to level the doorbell.  IMO, it should be provided with the kit.  2. Can link it to the wired chime in your house, which is fantastic, but also has it's own audible chime that is turned up to 11. If you are in your house with the door closed and Alexa playing Pantera on blast, you just might be able to hear this thing. A volume adjuster in the app would be nice.

138,David S.,Does not detect motion,  Disappointed is an understatement. I’ve had blink products for years and this was the first price of equipment from them that has totally fallen flat. I know it’s a cheap alternative to other security systems but I got it to sync to my other 4 cameras and was completely underwhelmed. First off you can’t set up a scheduled time for the doorbell to come on without purchasing another module on top of the one you own (which I already have for my other cameras). Secondly you have to force the front plate onto the mounted plate almost to the point to where you’re afraid the cheap plastic is going to break but somehow it latches into place. I put all of my weight onto it and was afraid I was going to rip the screws out of the trim. Then once installed the motion detection feature (even after turned on) doesn’t work. Don’t plan on this recording anything unless someone pressed the chime button (which does work).

140,Rachel,Good for existing Blink customers,"  I am a long-time user of Blink, meaning I am in the ""grandfathered"" set of customers with free, limited cloud storage for video.  Overall, I think if you are already a Blink customer, this is a good addition to your system.Install: I needed one of those ""wedges"" that turns the camera to face out and using that, the install was pretty simple.  I agree with the people that noted that the back plate it comes with (which you still use when installing the wedge) is a little cheap and janky.  But the wedge is more sturdy and the resulting install is probably a little bit more solid and better than if I had just mounted the flat plate to the wall.You do need a good sized piece of flat wood to screw everything into.  This is not going to mount well to raw siding, curved trim pieces around doors etc.  You'd have to attach a small board to the surface of anything like that and then mount it to that board.Power vs. batteries:  I have one of those wired doorbells that is old-school, with the metal strikers that hit little chimes, not a digital doorbell.  This apparently matters because you need more power and a slightly larger transformer to drive one of those doorbells.  In turn, that means the transformer has enough power to power the blink doorbell.  If you have a digital doorbell you may (or may not) need to rely on the battery for the cameras.  It all depends on how big the transformer for your existing, wired doorbell is.  During the setup it asks you what kind of doorbell you have, and has a fairly sophisticated set of settings to make sure that when it sends a signal to the physical doorbell it is sending the correct amount of power to strike the chimes correctly.Set-up: Very easy and painless, almost exactly the same as setting up a regular blink camera.  Put in the batteries, scan the QR code, it finds the camera, links it to your existing system/sync module and you are ready to go.Motion Sensor: If you are already pretty familiar with Blink cameras, you know they can come with one of two kinds of sensors to detect motion.  Camera based sensors that just detect changes in the picture and more traditional sensors that only detect actual, physical movement.  The cheaper Blink mini only has a camera based sensor, while the more expensive units only detect actual physical movement with a dedicated motion sensor.  Both kinds of sensors can be triggered falsely by something like blowing leaves, but the camera-based sensors cannot distinguish changes in shadows and light from actual movement and so they have much higher rates of false detection.  Unfortunately, the blink doorbell appears to only have the cheaper detector that can be fooled by changes in light.  It does, however, have a more sophisticated, narrower grid of zones you can exclude from movement than the older Blink mini.  How much this matters to you is going to depend on where you plan to stick the camera - if you point your doorbell camera directly at a busy road and don't lock out the parts of the image that covers the road, you will get constant alerts from every car that goes by, or every person walking on the sidewalk, etc.  So think carefully about where the camera will sit and whether you want one of those wedges to tilt the direction of the thing to keep the camera aimed only at places where you actually want it to detect motion.Video quality: Very good, with a wide angle, almost fish-eye lens, so you get very good broad coverage of the area you are pointing the camera at.  There is also a microphone that records sound while you are recording video and it seems to work ok as well.  In theory you can use the thing to have a two-way conversation with whoever is at the door, but I haven't tried that yet.  I am, overall, very happy with the camera quality for the price here.Sound Chime/notifications:  When you push the doorbell, a chime inside the module itself goes off.  It is reasonably loud and lets the person ringing the doorbell know they definitely rang it.  The light on the button also lights up briefly to confirm the chime was pressed.  Would you, sitting inside the house, hear the chime the doorbell makes outside?  Probably, if you are in a small, quiet house.  Would you hear it  down in the basement of a large house with the TV or music on?  Absolutely not.  So if you are not hooking this up to an existing doorbell with a properly loud internal chime, then you will want to have it hooked up to your Alexa.  I don't use Alexa so didn't test that feature.  You do get a notification on your phone, when somebody rings the bell,  but I think most people will want either a hard wired connection or an Alexa connected to this thing to make sure they always hear the doorbell.What don't I like?I wish it had the same motion detection sensors as the larger blink cameras.  I would have paid more to get that.  Because it uses the camera to sense motion there are places where it really won't give good results.  So think very carefully about where you will place this, how often the wind will blow trees and create moving shadows within the motion detection zone, etc.It is annoying that even when the device is hard-wired, the light around the doorbell button isn't constantly lit.  Just as if it were only running on batteries, it only lights up when you press the button.  Not a huge deal in my installation, but if you don't have a porch light on, your doorbell will not be obvious to visitors.  It is particularly odd that they put a red LED into the thing which apparently has no purpose other than in the initial setup.  The design would be much better if the lighted ring around the button was always lit and then it flashed or turned red when you pressed it.  It appears all of the hardware necessary to do that is in the device, but it is not programmed that way.  I get that when the device isn't hardwired you don't want the button lit, but when it is powered it really should be lit in the dark.For $50, this thing is ok.  If you get it on sale, then it is a good deal, at least if you are an existing Blink customer.I am surprised that they killed off the little bit of free cloud storage for new customers.  That can't cost very much to provide these days and it was the key differentiator between Blink and some of these other companies that provide more elaborate, high-priced options.  Blink's claim to fame is that it works well enough and is cheap.  But if you have to pay a bunch of money for cloud storage no matter what, I would probably look at the more expensive options vs. Blink.  It stops being a compelling value once you start having to pay for video storage.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2022"
141,Gonzo,Mount Defective,"  This is a follow up review to a one star review that I gave on this doorbell camera. After submitting the one star, I was contacted by Blink about the review. Long story short, they provided me with a brand new camera free of charge. I also purchased the wedge mount which was super helpful as I was having extreme difficulty trying to mount the camera to vinyl siding. If you are having trouble mounting the camera I strongly recommend purchasing the wedge mount. As for the performance of the doorbell camera, just like the other  7 cameras I have installed....it's just ""OK"". The biggest flaw is the video quality at night time with an outdoor light shining nearby. Overall, I'm fortunate that Blink took care of me and happy with the doorbell camera.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2021"
142,Sam B,"Not a security system, just a monitor system, a mediocre one at that","  I purchased multiple Blink items overall review-A real security system gives you at least 4 zones that can be adjusted and armed separately. It has an audible alarm, it may also have a cell phone connection. I have owned several such systems and had good service from them.Blink has none of these qualities.You can have ""zones"" but each will cost you $35 to $40 for a sync module so, 4 zones min $140 and you have nothing else. The cameras are not real motion detectors, as illumination does not set off motion detector like the blink cameras and doorbell do; hence multiple false alarms. If you use lights on timers  in the room with blink cameras they false alert each time a light turns on or off. Light control is a big part of security. Blink IR is very poor by today's standards.The Blink door bell has a sensitivity adjustment, but set to lowest setting it still alerts when a car goes down the street. It is 80' from my Blink doorbell to the edge of the road and it false alerts every time a vehicle goes in either direction.r I have mine on battery; you can hard wire it in place of your existing doorbell). Amazingly it alerts to cars but not to Amazon delivery people right in front of it. Yes it recorded 9 cars today (I live in a Cul-de-sac or I would have smashed the doorbell by now) but not the ghost that placed my Amazon package on the porch right in front of it.The Mini Cameras alert every time a light is turned on or off, but sometimes doesn't when I walk by.To use local storage instead of cloud you have to have at least one Sync module and an SD card. So if you have four zones as above example you add $10 to $20 per SD for each module which adds another $40 to $80 to your cost. Now all of your ""security recordings"" are on 4 different devices and totally separate. Does this sound like a security problem?The outdoor cameras are all three still in the box so I cannot tell what problems they will add. Too disappointed with Blink so far to waste time adding to my disappointment.The Echo Dot and Echo Show which Amazon recommended to go with the blink system are also still in the box so no info on problems they might have.I purchased all of this prior to Christmas in order to update and improve my 8 to 10 year old small security system. I do not use the Cloud for any security purpose so local storage was a must. Due to life in general, I did not have time to open and set everything up. When I finally got around to it, I became aware that the Mini's would work, but I had to purchase a Sync module to have local storage. Later found out that local only transfers videos to SD once a day and will NOT record Live View (yeah this is a security system LOL). You may notice that Blink does not tell you a lot of this in their description. For way less money I could have purchased a legitimate, real security system with 4, 6 or 8 zones and cameras with wifi and had something that I would trust and not hate. A friend suggested that I sell Blink on Craigslist. I told him the Blink system is bad: I would feel like a criminal asking money for it. It would make a good baby monitor using the Mini cameras, I guess.Amazon refuses to stand behind the Blink system since it is past their return date. I spoke with customer service and she transferred me to someone else for assistance with the Blink and they just hung up on me when I told them it was totally unsatisfactory.Buyer Beware. Just because Blink is owned by Amazon does not mean you will be pleased or they will stand behind it.I bought it, I didn't use it before return date so my fault for not doing my research. Now cut my loss and go to Costco and purchase a real functional security system.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2022"
143,JDR,Terrible Motion Detection,"  Unless your property is facing absolutely nothing, avoid the headache and get something better.Granted, my setup is worst case scenario, busy street a few yards from my front door, but that's no excuse to be triggering constantly while completely MISSING PEOPLE, capturing people is the whole point!!Seems this is a software issue, the cameras are set up to capture changes in brightness, as opposed to movement of contrasting pixels. This seems to be causing the camera to trigger every time the onboard white balance adjusts itself based on light in the image, which can be caused by lighting outside the detection zones. I tried everything, from using the smallest capture zone to using the lowest sensitivity, and still it wasn't working properly, continued to capture passing vehicles outside of the zones, while missing people. I could write a better detection program in a weekend myself. So MAYBE if Amazon hires actual programmers instead of dumping the work on unpaid interns, they might fix it. Until then, I would avoid.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2021"
144,R. Thomas,"Good for the Price, but not high quality","  Overall, for the value you get and the features I would recommend the doorbell because it isn't horrible.  I'm coming from a Ring Video doorbell 2 because I don't want to pay for recorded videos of people I have missed.  It only allows you live views, which is garbage!  I installed and am currently running on battery vs wired.  Integration with my existing Blink ecosystem was seamless and easy enough to do.  If you have an existing synch module, then you already know how to operate and setup things from the app.  All the features I had from the Blink mini and outdoor camera are the same, so there isn't a learning curve there.  I appreciate the fact that I can store motion videos in the cloud for free with the legacy synch module and don't have to pay for this service.  Maybe that will change in future?  I also like that I can upgrade the module to use store video on an external SD card locally and still not pay for cloud service.  Haven't used this feature yet, so I cannot comment on it. As you would imagine Alexa integration works fine as well, so alerts and door bell rings can be pushed to your Alexa powered devices.Now for the bad as I guess you get what you pay for.  The Blink outdoor and mini are easily 5 stars, but doorbell not so much. The reason I am giving 3 stars is because of a few things:1) the build quality is not the same as a Ring doorbell for example. Feels a little cheap and the mounting bracket and angle mounting brack are very cheap thin plastic.2) the release mechanism from the mount is absolutely horrible. I see this being a big issue for longer term and see it breaking. This is probably not a problem for those that are hard wired, but for those running on battery and need to take the doorbell on/off this is not good design. I can pretty much guarantee you will need a new mounting bracket or even new doorbell after a few battery changes. Also, the tool you use to detach the doorbell is hard to use and takes a little jiggling around to unmount the doorbell.3) there isn't a quick start guide and everything is online or in the Blink app so get it SETUP with the synch module BEFORE you try to mount!That's all I have for now.  Will update on battery life and if quality makes it past a harsh Winter and/or blistering Summer.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2021"
145,R. Thomas,4/5 - Not bad but not perfect,"  I purchased the Blink Video Doorbell + Sync Module 2 and Blink Video Doorbell Corner Mount. The Blink itself came with a corner mount, so buying the extra corner mount wasn't necessary. (It probably said that somewhere, but I don't remember reading that). Overall great product and I plan to buy more for the ret of my home.Likes: Easy setup for the sync module and doorbell itself. The app works well and the directions were easy to follow along. The app is nice. Easy to use. Once we set it up, it worked perfectly. We get notifications for any activity. The voice function works well.Dislikes: so-so installation. The directions could have had more details. I'm not sure if it exists, but a video installation would be helpful.

146,Lisa,Be Aware,"  The product description states that it works with digital doorbells. It does and it doesn't.What it doesn't tell you is that some doorbells need to have a Diode installed. It did not work with my doorbell.When I contacted Tech support and told them my problem, I asked if a Diode was needed. I was told that the device did not have the option to attach a diode but they have identified some customers using one.After messing around with a diode for a period of time, I got the bell to function properly, the way it is supposed to. I emailed the tech I was dealing with and suggested that since they are aware of the need for a diode in some bells, their engineers should into it more and let potential buyers know.Lets see what happens.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2021"
147,Cynthia Johnson,Mostly happy customer!,"  I’ve had Blink cameras for years…I was an early adopter of their brand well before Amazon bought them out.  Because we get unlimited online storage for free (grandfathered in on that deal), we haven’t seen much need to stray to a different company.  I was excited to see that Blink also made a video doorbell as that’s something we had been discussing.  I snatched this up on Black Friday and was ready to give it a shot!  I read all the reviews about installation issues and was expecting to have some, but I found installation to be easy.  And I’m a woman with limited installation experience of pretty much anything.  This camera works with either a Sync or Sync 2 box, but must have one or the other to use it wirelessly.  When I took my old doorbell off the frame I looked at the wires and thought, “Heck, I could probably wire this bad boy.”  After some reading, I found out that most doorbells don’t run on enough juice to power a video doorbell.  This would have been nice to know beforehand!  I realize they say the amount it needs to run on in the description, but who really thinks about what kind of power is running through their doorbell?!  Not me.  And I wasn’t interested in replacing the transformer just to have the dumb doorbell sound that you can’t hear unless you’re on the main floor so mine runs only through wireless and notifications via phone.  It’s nice that they included plastic caps for the doorbell wires that are already in place—I just didn’t happen to see them until after I had wrapped the ends in electrical tape.  An extra screw or two might be nice as I’m pretty sure I stripped one of them.Overall, the video picture is clear, the alert on my phone is unique (so I don’t mistake it for an alarm that utilizes a doorbell sound) and I’m mostly happy with my purchase.  What I don’t like is that it takes FOREVER to pull up the video feed of who is actually at the doorbell.  As I’ve never owned a Ring doorbell, I have no idea if this is SOP for video cameras or not.  It’s not enough to deter me, but it’s not quite as instantaneous as I was hoping for.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2021"
148,Cynthia Johnson,Good not great...installation is harder than it looks and still no PC app,"  This is the 5th camera we have in our Blink system. To be honest, we have them more to watch the wildlife than as a security feature, but they do that, too. The wall our doorbell is on is uneven rock, which is not really an issue for doorbell that is two inches long and half an inch wide. This Blink doorbell is much bigger, so the uneven surface is an issue; it was hard to get the unit to slide onto the mounting bracket, and there are lots of big gaps around where it mounts. Nonetheless, eventually got it relatively stable and in the right place. It would not be very hard to rip it off the wall, though not sure why anyone would do that. It seems to work well, though I still have two big issues with the Blink system overall: 1) There is STILL no PC app, which is really odd. It's great to be able to access the system via your phone, but phones are not ergonomically the best way to access and control such a system. 2) Battery life is not great, though it is impacted by your settings. And it is binary. The battery is either fine, or you get a message to ""replace the battery"" and that camera shuts down soon after. It would be great, though, if the system could manage the battery much as my phone and PC manage their battery. Specifically, when it hit a certain threshold (such as 15%) the Blink system could automatically scale back the settings to conserver the battery while still functioning. In the case of Blink, it could step down the resolution, shorten clip length, lower the IR (night vision) illumination, etc. All of these things will save the battery life while still functioning so I have more time to get to it. Today, once it hits that ""replace battery"" if I'm on vacation or a business trip away from the house it will likely shut down before I get to it, and then I have nothing.The Blink system overall is pretty good, but really surprising they have not done a few more easy things to make it a great system.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2021"
149,Chad B.,Seems like an immature beta product - needs some work to be good.,"  *Second update* I'm downgrading my rating to one star now. I needed to remove the doorbell to install the wedge back so it could be mounted at an angle. When I removed it, apparently four mounting tabs broke off. I just noticed because it wouldn't attach to the backplate anymore and I heard some rattling inside. See the attached picture of the pieces I managed to get out of the main camera body after shaking it about a bit. That is just terrible plastic quality. And yes, I used the recommended tool and procedure from their website. Also, the rubber grommets in the backplate seemed completely disintegrated already. Be warned, if you ever need to detach the camera be extremely careful and be prepared that you break stuff. I can no longer mount it and will need a new backplate.*Update* After about a week of using it there was a firmware update that fixed the chime volume at the doorbell and it's now silent. Customer service was very responsive and followed up to confirm the issue is resolved. The view and installation issues remain though so I'll update from 2 to 3 stars for now (the installation issues only seem fixable with a new design of the physical hardware).*Original Review*I was over the moon when the release of this long awaited doorbell was finally announced! I've been waiting to get rid of those terrible Ring doorbells and replace them with this.I have to say though, the only saving grace for this is the long battery life (Ring's are horrible even with all motion features turned off). With so much development time and delay under its belt, I would have expected more. Some details:* Mounting experience is horrible. I don't know what product design was thinking but that backplate you have to press the device on to is something else. You have to press really hard and push up, and there's not much feedback to see if it's secure or not.* I saw a feature in the app to turn off the ringer - which I like to do, what's the point of the outside person hearing a chime anyway. Unfortunately, this doesn't work - at all. When I asked customer service, after two back and forth exchanges, they finally admitted (and I quote) ""Seems like the ringer volume on doorbell settings is not fully functional since this is a newly added feature on the app"". Oh you figured that out when a customer told you? Shouldn't you have found this during your own testing? I'm not impressed.* With the Ring ones, I can see a picture of who's at the door on relevant Alexa devices with a screen. This one for some reason doesn't do that although it does announce that someone's at the door.* I have two doorbells, front and back door, and although they're both connected with a corresponding unique name, all Alexa does when someone rings the doorbell is ""Someone's at the Blink Doorbell"". Well, which one is what I would like to know - why can that integration not be fixed to actually use the designated label or name of the device?I do understand there will be feature and maybe some quality differences between a low price segment device such as this and more expensive ones such as the Ring range, but honestly if it weren't for the long battery life there'd be virtually no difference to me in terms of functionality (they both are bad). Honestly, for how long we've been waiting for the doorbell, and assuming it's undergone a fair amount of development since the original announcement, this product is a bit of a disappointment. One can't help but wonder, given they're both from the same parent company, if it's almost designed to push you to the more expensive range, but then why put effort into development in the first place.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2021"
150,HandyMark,A solid place to start,"  This thing was pretty much plug and play. I already live in the Amazon ecosystem, so it took no time at all to get this set up. The picture looks good, and it is easy to tell everything you're looking at. I saw a few comments about people having issues with the motion sensor, but I haven't had this issue, and kinda surprised that it doesn't go off every time a car goes down the street or a cat walks by, but definitely comes on when a person walks through the yard. The microphone isn't amazing, and the person at the door has to talk louder in order for you to hear them properly, but it's not unusable by any means. The backplate that holds the batteries was defective in mine, but I contacted Blink and they had a replacement here in 2 days, so good on them. The mounting is ""meat and potatoes"" unless you want a super specific angle.The only reason that I'm knocking a star off is because the local backup only supports 256GB flash drives. I bought a 2 TB external USB HDD for the backup, and can't use it. I found where it stated this on the website but; A. It was something that was not easy to find and; B. This is a small amount when you are talking about recording video and audio. This means that in order to clear the drive, you are going to have to unplug it and delete everything manually, and often. Cmon, Jeff. It's 2021, and we can only use 256 GB? Kinda ridiculous...All in all, I'm happy with it. I'll be getting some of the cameras to sync with it and using the subscription service for the cloud storage. I've seen complaints about this by the way, but I don't feel like $10 a month unreasonable. If you don't like it, don't pay for it. People pay more than that for Netflix, and that does nothing to help secure you're house and property.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2021"
151,Vitalykroy,First iteration of some must-have features,"  The Blink doorbell camera has some really interesting features, and some others that remain to be desired. I bought this together with the Sync module 2, and have been using it with the Premium function (on a free trial) and without the Premium function. Here are my thoughts:Pros:1. It mounted well and had easy to set up instructions, including with the sync module2. It runs on battery - I’ve used it for about a month now, and the battery seems to be okay. It does boast a 6 month battery, but so far so good and no problems unlike other reviewers who faced battery issues. I don’t have a wiring capability at my apartment so this was key.3. The Sync Module 2 works without the Premium function, but do read on for more details.Things that need improvement:1. Chime - because the doorbell is not wired, it only rings outdoors (no one inside the home can hear it), through my phone and through the my Echo devices (dot and echo show), but I have found these notifications not great and sometimes very slow. So a chime system together with the Sync Module 2 would have been perfect2. Slow… everything is just so slow on the app. To get a notification of motion or when the bell is pressed, it is at least 5 to 10 seconds before you get notified. To load the videos even on cloud, or on live view, it takes at least 5 seconds to load. The live view part is extremely extremely annoying, because in 5 seconds someone can run away with something!! Viewing pre recorded notifications of motion is possible without a subscription through the Sync Module, but it is also slow to load, and doesn’t show previews. But it works, and you don’t have to pay extra for it.Overall, I am happy with the device, but I find myself unable to give higher than 3 stars. If the connectivity issue is not slow, I would have loved it more, but for now, I believe this is a first iteration of the features that every future doorbell devices should have.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2022"
152,Mark,Its Just OK,"  I've had a Blink security camera system for about 2 years and I have few complaints. I have the cameras up high in my exposed roof rafters looking down so the don't pick up my front fence line or the street view. I purchased the door bell to get an outward street camera. Now I added the door bell to my system and I've notice that its has some differences that I don't like.1st off you have to go outside and press the door bell button when you make a setup change. I don't keep my camera system armed during the day as I've been home a lot (Retired) but like it on at night. So to arm my doorbell camera I have to open my front door and press the button after every setup or arming change.2nd there is no live camera view now option, it only records video if the bell button is pushed or if armed there is movement. I like being able to hit the live camera view if needed at night from my bedroom if I'm notified there's been disturbance.3rd I wired it to my old low-voltage door bell but it doesn't ring when the button is press. It rings if you use metal on the posts to complete the circuit on the mounting bracket. So I'm not sure what's going on there. The system ring is adequate so I've not gone back to get it to work.I do like that it records if the bell button has been pushed even if its not armed. Its got a great wide angle camera view that picks up my whole front yard. I didn't have any problems installing to the app or mounting it.I'm stumped on the Alexa Blink setup, it wont email me the setup code after many attempts.

153,Rayne Traulsen,Great addition to my Blink system,"  The delivery came quickly. I took my time to read instructions on line (the email with information was delayed and there was little in the packaging). I needed to upgrade my sync module so I could take advantage of the USB memory stick to save clips. The doorbell was actually very simple to install in the most basic way. Connecting it to the existing door bell buzzer is turning out to be more complicated. But both the door bell button module and my cell phone both chime loudly when the button is pushed and the video is taken even when the rest of the system is turned off.The one thing that was a bit fiddly was adjusting the sensitivity since it faced out to the street and anything moving out there triggered the video. So before I tried to connect the existing doorbell wires, I just fiddled with the sensitivity for a few days. Then I used the corner mount and moved it over to the left of the front door so it aimed more at the side wall/fence yet still picked up any localized movement. There was a comment that it works best if people don't approach straight at it but from an angle. So now it does not pick up anything further away than my driveway but I have a lot of clips of our local hooligans, the raccoons. I am also moving one of my solar powered outside motion activated walkway lights over to the door frame so that at night there will be ample lighting. I bought the solar powered system of 8 lights also from Amazon a few months ago and they work great even when their location is shaded. So so far, I am delighted although this is my first video doorbell and I have nothing else to compare it to.

I also have no photos of any delivery person dropping anything off on my porch - and I have received packages.  I will continue to experiment with the sensitivity, but I'm not hopeful.  Also, when I go to take a photo of the front porch from my phone, more times than not, I get the message, ""Thumbnail failed.""

I got really confused and checked my mail box and front door . It was not delivered.  Finally, after chasers, the item was delivered late in the evening.Now about the item itself. ( Great Toy for kids).My 12 year son was super excited to do a unboxing video and went ahead did the unboxing and setup .  Had my USB drive connected to the sync module for storage. Setup done and good to go.Issues :1) The app takes for ever to load recorded clips or it just keeps spinning. I am sure Amazon wants your nice monthly subscription for cloud storage. Local storage is just a joke. It works one time and just keeps spinning most of the time that is loading from USB drive. App complains about USB drive could longer to load. Wow, loading from internet seem much faster than local storage. What a rip off ?2) My townhouse front door area has bright sunlight , when someone arrives or rings the door the bell the background , trees etc. look awesome except the person. The camera quality is so bad and cannot capture the faces clearly.  If you have  a  bright sunlight front door, this device is useless and works great just a normal door bell.3) Unable to delete unwanted videos, you have wait for the video to load and pause the video to see the delete button. If the video does not you cannot remove the video from your local storage. I ended up formatting my USB drive on my PC to clear the space.4) Finally , I wasted 1 hour of my time toying around this junk.

To reset the camera settings,require a tool take the device out.

156,AmazonCustomer,Does it's job. But it really needs a standalone chime.,"  We've been using Blink outdoor cameras for quite awhile. Back when they were independent Blink. So we're grandfathered into the old no pay plan.I think that the Blink cameras in general do a good job. The doorbell is no different. It was easy to install and it works. We have it scheduled to film at night with the other cameras, or when we are away during the days (my wife and I both work from home), we activate the system manually. The cameras and doorbell do their jobs as they should. So the doorbell camera functions pretty much like a regular security camera that you can schedule, but still activates and records when someone presses the doorbell button off schedule.Installation of the doorbell was seamless. If you are familiar with the Blink setup process of adding an additional camera, it's a cakewalk. First timers should have no issues either.When you install the backplate, you just need to ensure that you haven't caused it to buckle/warp out of shape via your drilling in of the screws, otherwise you may have a hard time sliding the camera onto the backplate/mount. If that is good, then you simply slide the camera down onto the mount until it clicks into place. All in all it's a 10 minute install give or take.I do see a number of people stating that there’s a big lag in the recordings. But I’ve never really had that issue. We have an Ubiquiti mesh system so maybe that helps?Is Blink the end all, be all in home security? No.But it does what it says it will if you set the cameras/doorbells up correctly. It's an easy to install system, that requires no wiring and it acts as a deterrent. Reasonably priced too. Which is why I chose it over Arlo. It's also great for when your dogs go out to potty at night.My only true beef with the doorbell itself is the lack of an add on chime. Seems like a pretty big oversight to me, and hopefully that will be an option soon (Blink if you're reading this).Some people don't have an accessible wired chime, or wired chime period - like me. And many of us don't want an Alexa unit in the house - me again.Yes- the bell does emit an audible tone OUTSIDE at the bell itself when pressed, but inside I cannot hear it. Yes - you can get the notification on your mobile. But I keep my phone on do not disturb while I am working. So the lack of an add on chime is the downside to the doorbell.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2022"
157,Ollie,Great video bell and great price,"  I had a ring doorbell that I purchased from Costco a few months back. I liked it ok but then started having issues with the motion detection and the actual ringing of the bell. Saw this on a black Friday deal at a tremendous price difference for what I paid for my ring. It's pretty comparable to the ring. Has detection that you can turn up or down depending on how sensitive you want to keep it at. Mine was picking up my neighbor across the street putting up Christmas lights which was a little too much for me. So we lowered the sensitivity. It rings to my existing chime box in my house which if it didn't would have been a deal breaker for me. I'm old school. Like to hear that ding dong instead of having to have my phone only make the sound. I did order an echo show to connect it to so I can see who's at the door when I'm cooking or doing something where I don't have my phone right next to me. Still waiting on delivery of that. It's still on back order I'm assuming because it was at such a great sale price last week. Hope that works out. The bell itself is very sleek looking. Fits on my door nicely although I must say I have it to the side so I needed to order the tilt bracket so it would face my steps properly. But that was only $7. No biggie. No issues installing or putting backing on like others have said. There is a tool in the box that helps with that. So far so good. Definitely a more cost effective alternative to a ring and so far to me this is superior to ring. If you are deciding between this and ring, especially at the price point, I say go with blink.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2021"
158,Jamie P,Not very durable - good entry level system,"  I bought my first Blink Video Doorbell camera and installed it on December 2, 2021 in a hard wired fashion.  It was relatively intuitive and instructions provided were terrific.  It was also easy to integrate with Alexa.  Initially, I didn't have the same issues of mounting the camera to the back as others have mentioned they have (the first time).  The doorbell camera worked well with explainable issues.  1) The camera is designed to trigger when there are changes in temperature.  My dryer exhaust vents at the front porch and would, on occasion, trigger the camera.  2) The front of the house faces Southwest.  Sunsets can very easily blind the camera - shadows of people walking by also set off the camera (the ""Zones"" functionality doesn't work all that well).  The snow plow that comes to the street will also set it off.Fast forward to the end of February (3 months after installation) and I receive notification on the Blink app that I need to replace the batteries.  My understanding is that the batteries are supposed to last longer but 3 months is reasonable I guess.  I removed the camera from the base, replaced the batteries, and could not get it mounted correctly.  The tabs to mount the camera broke off (plastic).  I ended up having to purchase another unit to replace the old one (corner plates are available, but I don't see standard mounting plates available for sale).About the best piece of advice I can provide is don't tighten that wall plate as tight as you need it - it will bend the back plate and make mounting more difficult.

159,Joe De,What I needed to compliment my Blink cameras,"  I have been using the Blink cameras for several years and I have always liked them. When I got the pre-order notification for the doorbell I immediately placed an order.I am more than satisfied with the video quality and settings of the device, the video is crisp and clear but of course you can adjust these settings to suit your individual preferences. Whether you want to preserve battery life or sacrifice it in spite of video quality and consistent monitoring of your home is up to you.I mounted mine with batteries as opposed to hard wiring, I also used the corner mount which had to be ordered separately (oddly) for free with a code provided by Amazon.The installation took maybe 5 minutes, it was simple and instructions are provided. Keep in mind that, to lock the doorbell in place you need to press hard. Remember, the device will be exposed to the elements and possibly tampering so it needs to be sealed tight. DO NOT throw away the small key provided in the box as you will need it in order to remove your device for whatever reason.The chime sound it emits when the doorbell button is pressed, is definitely audible and the speaker is loud and clear. The motion activation works as it should. I tested mine with a grocery delivery and the person was definitely spooked when they heard my voice, but I was glad it worked as the delivery person was not sure if it was the right home and their app was not working at the time, so we were able to communicate through the Blink doorbell. I’d say it’s totally worth it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2021"
160,Amazon Customer,45 degree angle using my old Ring mount!,"  My doorbell is set into an alcove in my home and the old button doorbell was flush mounted to a side wall, so a 45 degree mount is the only option for my home. I had a Ring doorbell (720 dpi) and it was time to upgrade it to the newer Blink system of cameras that I already have inside my home. I waited for the new Blink doorbell that just released (shipped 11/01/21) with the higher video resolution, but had to do mod on the old Ring mount so as to make it face the correct way out. I created a faceplate out of an old clear plexiglass scrap I had laying around. Marked where holes were on the old Ring doorbell were located on the Plex which was easy since it was clear anyways. Cut, drilled and mounted it to the old 45 degree Ring base. It's not half bad and a fresh coat of house paint over the mount and new faceplate will serve it well. It took awhile to figure out the most optimal way to set the setting in the phone app... but with a little trial and error I figured it out. Put all your Blink cameras on the same category as your Blink Sync Module 2. Arm the entire system then click on the little runner icon above each camera to turn off your interior cameras so as not to get false alarms as you walk around in your own home. This way only your outdoor cameras are armed during your awake hours.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2021"
161,Martina Kilgo,It's OK I guess...,"  I've probably had this doorbell on and off the wall a good 20 times to get it setup. For starters, it's basically mandatory to have wired power from the house. It's useless without it, even though it comes with batteries. The lithium name brand batteries it came with failed in less than a week and any other batteries I use produce a low battery indicator in the user interface. Anytime I dismount the unit to address these issues I have to hit the reset button on the back, rediscover my wifi and re-enter the password, very irritating. Like the other blink devices you have to manually go through every motion notice to clear the notifications. I should have the option to clear them all. This is super irritating when you have a lot of movement like family visiting, and you see 178 notifications in the app. You also can't disarm just one camera, it's either all or none. The doorbell will go off when the cat walks by but if someone legitimately comes to the door it magically doesn't work for whatever reason. I've yet to have it successfully tell me when someone is at the door and also ring when they press it. It should do both. It also had an episode where it just wouldn't work with the alexas I set up. I had to reinstall the system to get it to connect to the alexas again. I really wish this thing was just plug and play but it's buggy and I've spent way too much time fiddling with it. I'm writing this review because 30 minutes ago someone came to the door and it failed to announce the movement and it failed to ring when they pressed the button. They had to knock. I check my other camera and I see the person press the button and just stand there wondering why nobody came to the door. But I bet 100 dollars tonight in my sleep the cat will trip the motion and my alexa will wake me up. And then the next day a delivery will come and nothing will happen. Should have gone with the Ring, you know, the device Blink is ripping off.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2021"
162,Martina Kilgo,Check your account creation date on Legacy systems because not all Legacy systems are grandfathered.,"  Added to my existing Blink cameras was easy. Doorbell works good and have it ringing on my Alexa devices.But I have issues with the whole marketing of these.I have a legacy system with several XT2 cameras and enjoy the 7200 seconds (2hrs) of free online video storage. No monthly fees required. I had read that these doorbells would be grandfathered into that legacy system and share that video storage time.BUT NO!!The fact is not all legacy systems will not honored...only those activated by April 15, 2020. I apparently activated mine in June. So I have a Legacy system but no, not really.I bought the first system under the assumption based on their advertisements that I would enjoy 2 hours of lifelong free video storage online, no subscriptions required and may expand the system piece by piece as necessary....but NO they changed it all up and gave a big fat middle finger to their early adopters and said now you will have to pay for said storage if you want to expand your system and picked a arbitrary date of April 15th, 2020. Note the people who purchased the XT2 systems after April 15th were not told they had a ""red headed stepchild tweener of a system"" that wouldn't be supported as advertised into the future.To make it worse, when you install the doorbells it automatically starts a 30 day ""Free Trial"" of online video storage that you cannot opt out of. By the time that the ""Free Trial"" expires and you realize hey this isn't working on my ""Legacy"" but not really Legacy 7200 seconds of free online video storage you are past the 30 day Amazon return window...so screw you. We have stuck you with these useless, non- returnable pieces of crap unless you now pay us $10.00 a month to get what we originally promised you would get subscription free.Seems like a classic case of bait and switch..",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2021"
163,Brooklyn,Its good for the price,"  I may update this later.  Overall the blink system does what it says it does.  Since I just installed, and am still tweaking, it we will see about the battery life.  This system is very easy to install and set up.  There are instructions in the phone app to assist in mounting the doorbell.  There are a couple of things that are not so great though.  One is the mount for the additional camera.  The one that comes with it is garbage.  It is a friction fit that does not fit.  I wonder how many people have broken it trying to mount the camera.  I found an add on mount here which works very well.The other concern I have is with the motion detection and clip length.  I currently have the motion sensitivity set to 6 for both the doorbell and the camera.  The doorbell does well at picking up motion (i.e. cars driving by) albeit late.  Often the clip will start with the car 3/4 of the way across the view.  The other camera I have mounted on the opposite side of my garage from the doorbell.  There have been multiple instances so far where the doorbell camera picks up and records motion but the additional camera does not.The clip length is adjustable but finite.  The one thing I think would be nice is the option to have the camera continue recording as long as there is motion.  As it is the maximum clip length is 60 seconds with a minimum pause of 10 seconds before it starts again.  I would love the ability to set clip length to 10-15 seconds with the option to keep recording if there is still motion present.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2021"
164,Michelle S.,Poor quality doorbell,"  TL;DR Actual positives/negatives are below this paragraph.So I purchased this doorbell recently because I currently have two systems at my house; ring and blink. The doorbell I have is ring and so I wanted to make everything I had talk with each other properly and easily. I love the blink outdoor cameras and everything went smooth with them so I decided to replace my current doorbell and go with blink. Turns out, this doorbell is not NEARLY as nice as a ring doorbell. The only issue I have that has nothing to do with my issues with this doorbell but may help someone in the future who is doing the same replacement, is that the holes that mount this doorbell do NOT at ALL line up with the ring doorbell mounting holes. Thus, you will either have to fix holes or figure out how to make them non-visible in your house. So onto the actual review of the doorbell:Positives:- Slick packaging- Nice looking- Easy to set up- Good quality cameraNegatives:- Doorbell overall has a cheap feel to it; has a lot of cheap feeling plastic.- Hard to mount. To mount this correctly, you have to apply a decent amount of downward force to the doorbell. It just made me un-easy trying to do it correctly (even after watching the video).- Very easy for someone to steal. The 'special tool' they give you did absolutely nothing to help me get this off the mount after I heard and felt it snap in. I thought I did something wrong so I removed the mount from my house and engaged everything by itself. I was very easily able to disassemble the doorbell from the mount. This is far from able to be accomplished with my ring doorbell with the security measures they include in the mounting kit.- Gasket material to prevent water intrusion through the screw holes are useless. While I was screwing into the provided wall anchors through the mounting plate, the gasket material easily dislodged itself and was sandwiched between my house and the mounting plate. Might still do the job, but it's not how it's supposed to work.- Does not include mini level for ensuring template is actually level when attempting to drill holes for mounting bracket. This may seem like a petty thing, but the ring doorbell comes with a tiny level to help you make sure your doorbell isn't crooked. With how they tell you to mount this, it has a piece of paper that you eye-up to drill the holes. You'd have to go above and beyond and pre-mark plum/level lines to ensure it's accurate. The ring doorbell includes all the stuff you need to just do this, which eliminates an extra step of the process.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2021"
165,jpp,"Not sure how secure it is, a bit of lag on the video","  Installed on my porch.  The Blink is located in the corner, so needed the corner mount.  With the corner mount installed, it covers the entire 90 degree field of view.But I'm not sure how secure it is.  Seems you could rip it off with enough effort.  It's not easy, but if you knew how to do it, doesn't seem hard.Plus is, it connected to my XT2 system kit that I bought in 2019.  Connecting it to the app was really easy.Also, doorbell will not work till you calibrate it in the app.  It kept frustrating me, because I kept pushing the button trying to make it work, then rewiring, before mounting everything.Now the bad.  Unlike my XT2 camera and Blink Mini, there seems to be a pretty large delay when the video starts.  As a for instance.  On the Blink Mini, the video seems to start before I see any movement in the video by a second or two.  Same with the XT2.  It'll start recording, before you see any motion.  But on the Doorbell, there seems to be a delay.  For instance, I had the XT2 mounted on the porch.  When an animal passed, the video would start before the animal was even in frame, and video his entire movement past the door.  On the Doorbell, the animal is almost completely out of frame before the video even begins.  This becomes a problem for something that quickly passes.  Especially porch pirates that don't stay long.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2022"
166,Michael R Bornstein,MUST PURCHASE A SUBSCRIPTION!,"  Please read the entire review.Though you only have to pay as little as $30 per year, and the customer service at Blink (when you finally get through) is awesome, be aware you will have to purchase a membership.  Had they been clear about this upfront, I would have given them a much better rating.They CLAIM:""We want you to knowBlink Video Doorbell Standalone does not include Sync Module 2. Without a Sync Module, live-view and two-way audio are available only in response to a doorbell press or motion event. With a Sync Module or Sync Module 2 get these features anytime on-demand."" ~ from seller's listing on Amazon.BUT!  Even with Module 2 and a USB memory stick (which it says NOTHING about), this doorbell does NOT give you the ability to see LIVE who is at your door.  It is NOT like our other cameras (we already had a 5 camera system), and it does NOT allow you to communicate with the person at your door UNLESS you pay the $30.  We initially mounted one of our 5 video cameras at the front door and had a regular doorbell.  That worked perfectly because you could talk to the person at the front door and see them immediately.  We thought we would upgrade, but really it became a downgrade!IF you don't want to pay a $30 subscription fee, purchase a single video camera, mount it at your front door, and use a regular doorbell.  It will be cheaper in the long run.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 24, 2021"
167,Tony B,Strange limitations and frustrating to setup,"  So most of my issues are with the app. It is not clear that things are split into ""Systems"" where cameras sharing a Blink Module need to be in the same system. Within the system, there is not control over scheduling by camera - all cameras in the system follow the same schedule. If you accidentally add a camera to the wrong system, or heaven forbid add the blink module to the wrong system, be prepared for a frustrating stream of repeating steps and mashing reset buttons. It is klunky and poorly thought out to say the least. In addition, the mount plate for the doorbell requires just the right touch. You have to sorta put the top on, slide down and while pushing down push the bottom in. It is an unsatisfactory connection. The camera works fine, the blink module does what it should, and in a surprising find, I was able to program a routine in Alexa to play a chime on my ecobee thermostat with Alexa when the doorbell is pushed.All in, the app and UI needs to be polished and thought thru better.Update: the sync module does not work for storing videos. It recognizes the USB drive and it is connected to wifi with no issues. Just no videos ever get recorded, which makes it a pretty useless brick with a blue and green LED. This system is annoying and frankly, pretty lousy. It seems as if Blink set out with the goal of making things only work with a subscription, but not work at all without it, even with hardware specifically designed for it (supposedly). Quite clever of them actually. But also pretty despicable.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2022"
168,Amazon Customer,I Want To Love This But I Can't,"  I have a Blink system and have been running it for 8 months at the time of this review.  I have 4 cameras and a Sync hub that I use with a flash drive for local storage so I don't have to have a cloud storage subscription.I really want to love this doorbell but it has done nothing it was promised to do since I ordered it.  Day one, out of the box it wasn't recording any motion.  After a lengthy battle with Amazon I was able to return it.  However, I bought it on sale and the price had gone up so after another battle with Amazon I was given a promotion credit on my account to cover the price difference.  The second doorbell was purchased and arrived.  It was doing the same exact thing.  Connecting, saying it was running, but no video recording.  After a back and forth with Blink support via email over the course of a week or so, they finally come back with ""Oh, there's an issue with the doorbell and it not recording to local storage. Our engineers are working on a fix.""  There solution was to give me a free 30 day cloud subscription.  It's recording but now ALL of my cameras are recording to cloud storage.  Great. It works. However, in 30 days if the doorbell doesn't have a firmware fix yet, what am I suppossed to do?  Contact support and see if they'll extend my free days for another free 30 days.  I went with the local storage option so I wouldn't have to pay for an annual subscription.  I feel like this ""issue"" is just a way of Blink trying to get more people to go with a Cloud subscription.Additionally, I still cannot get it to display to my Echo Show.  But that's a hill I haven't been willing to battle yet given everything else I've already went through with just getting the doorbell to do basic functions.If they ever get the doorbell functioning to where it will work and record to local storage, I'll update this review.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2022"
169,Harris,"Needs good WiFi signal, and watch that WiFi channel assignment!","  Updated rating from 3 to 4 after I made some WiFi network adjustments.After I have not extended my cloud subscription trial and opted out for local storage option, this system started to have recurring issues with recording video clips. The system at some point would just stop recording. After call to customer service, the problem was diagnosed to be an unreliable WiFi issue. I troubleshooted some more on my own and figured that my WiFi will sometimes get stuck on a channel that has a lot of contention (traffic) which affects the transmission speed. This is a router problem in the end, however I think problem like that make this system very unreliable as a security camera, if you have no subscription plan.  Makes me also wonder, why these WiFi issues didn't have any negative effect while the trial cloud subscription was still active? All the clips were recorded to the cloud with no hiccup when the subscription was active. After using WiFi analyzer tool, I have identified the best channel to use and assigned that channel to my WiFi network, since my router's algorithm  couldn't pick a good channel, when set in Auto mode. The system worked fine since then. With no cloud subscription plan, you can opt to store your recorded clips locally on a flash drive. You will still be able to receive notifications and play your files in Blink app., even when your phone with Blink app. installed is out of the range of your WiFi, which is good.

I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app three times to no avail.  Same problem every time.Next is the fact that you can not even watch the camera very long beofor it shuts down.  I am trying to use it to keep an eye on mail arriving so that packages don't get stolen ...and since the motion detection only notifies you but does not open the camera, you have to keep saying ""Alexa open the camera, Alexa open the camera, Alexa open the camera, Alexa open the camera, Alexa open the camera, Alexa open the camera..."" every 30 to 60 seconds.  Where is the ability to just open the camera and it stays open until you close it?Night vision is kinda generic.  Most night vision cameras (of decent quality) provide a no-shadow effect that also prevent high glare.  The light glares off of anything reflective to the point where the rest of the image fades out and is blurry or unable to be seen.It's a waste of money in my opinion and ready for the garbage when the new camera system arrives.

173,Efrain,"Complete garbage clarity, mobile app and operation overall","  I seriously do not understand why this camera has so many good reviews when it’s really a pathetic competitor to Ring. Amazon owns both companies so I also don’t get why they decided to launch a competing product against an already insanely good doorbell and security camera system. Yes, it’s cheaper than Ring but the difference in clarity both day and night, motion detection, other security features and the mobile app UX, make it worth the few extra dollars to get any Ring doorbell product. If you already dropped $90 on the Blink doorbell system, you CAN shell out another $30 for Ring.  You want to be cheap, then you get what you pay for.The mobile app is unbelievably glitchy and clunky to use. It’s difficult to find things or adjust settings. Even after you have things set up how you’d like, they don’t work.The biggest issue is motion detection. I had it set to 10/10 for sensitivity and it doesn’t pick up anything. Doesn’t record or save as promised to the cloud, only doorbell events. The tenant that lives next door, and our doorways are adjacent and we share the same stairway, was never triggering the motion detection. We then had a robbery next door, camera was pointing in the exact direction of my neighbor, and it didn’t catch/record anything. This was during the day. I wouldn’t count on this to deter any package stealers either. Not like you’d see anything recorded when or if it does happen to you.I have the Ring doorbell system at another rental and it’s light years better than Blink.

Based on the 2 months of use so far, it has performed up to my expectations. I get timely recordings of activities and the pressing of the doorbell.The ability to edit and  block certain areas from the motion detection is great as my wife likes to fly various decorative/holiday flags from the front door and I can eliminate false alerts, caused by those flags moving, by adjusting the areas that are picked up. I can also eliminate cars going up the street if I want to yet still detect someone walking on the sidewalk in front of our place.It has a nice angle of view the essentially covers my entire front yard.Since it is integrated with my Alexa devices I can call the camera up and view my front doorstep on any of my Echo Shows at any time. Plus all my Alexa devices notify me of a doorbell press.Full disclosure, I have subscribed to the cloud service at $30 yr. This is not a requirement to use the doorbell, but if you want to save all ""activity"" it is reasonable for the added functionality.

178,MayBae,"Decent camera, has become useless as batteries don't last","  I've been a Blink user for many years and still have several devices around my home. It made sense to look into the doorbell as well since it would easily integrate into the existing system. Installing and mounting was pretty straight forward. The view angle is great as it captures the whole front of my property with a pretty clear picture. At night however, the images get blown out. I have a Blink camera at the top of my driveway and the IR light, in conjunction with this the doorbell IR causes the image to get blown out.The BIGGEST complain however is the battery life. I installed the camera on 12/18/2021. On 1/17/2022 the batteries died. On 2/18/2022 the new batteries died again. I only used the recommended Energizer Lithium batteries. I've reduced sensitivity and recording length and it had no impact on battery life. There is no possible way that these would EVER last 2 years as they state. At this pace changing the batteries so frequently will end up weakening the backing plate over time and at some point I see the possibility of the device no longer holding to it. Not to mention the additional cost of the batteries, which are not cheap.When contacting Blink, their solution was to uninstall the device from the app and reinstall. When that did not work, they said to put it on a reduced schedule. That completely defeats the purpose of the device. We have it so that we can see what goes on in the neighborhood, especially as car break-ins are on the rise.Blink needs to come up with a way to externally power this device, similar to their cameras. Whether it be via AC power or solar.** MISSED OPPORTUNITY BY BLINK **",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2022"

180,Loki,A Great Starter Video Doorbell for a Reasonable Price,"  I like that it was easy to setup and reasonably easy install. I wanted a basic doorbell system to see if this kind of thing will work for me. I did have some difficulty with affixing the camera to the backplate and experienced minor difficulty removing the camera from the backplate.  It would be great if there was a more affordable antitheft case option.  I believe doorbell camera theft is a real risk.  The option to use this system without a monthly subscription is important to me.  Pairing the Sync Module 2 with your camera enables features such as local video clip storage and and live camera views without a subscription.  Alexa integration could be improved.  I can easily arm the system with an Alexa command, but disarming it is more complex, I suppose for security reasons. Also, it would seem a natural extension of Alexa to allow a single command to enable both Alexa Guard and arming the Blink doorbell.  Alexa routines are unnecessarily complex to set up. Some of the online reviews are critical and point to other more expensive systems.  I disagree.  I paid $59 for both the doorbell camera and the sync module during a special promotion.  This system does exactly what I expect of a lower tier system.  Likewise, I don't expect an economy vehicle to drive or perform like a high end luxury model.  Both do their job as expected.  I'm very satisfied and would buy it again.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2022"

182,Matthew Evans,Disappointed in this product,"  I mistakenly believed that this would integrate well with my Echo Show device in a way that when someone rang the doorbell, the picture would automatically pop up on the Show device... That is not the case.  The audio alert comes quickly however and the phone notification comes quickly but it's still awkward to have to manually ""summon"" the camera to show you who is at the door.  That's just one of my disappointments.  Beyond that, why does the chime ring LOUDLY outside when someone rings the bell?  They don't need to hear it, I do!  Yet inside the house,  the ding is softer on both the echo show and the cell phone, and if you aren't in the same room as either of those devices, you are not going to hear it!  So overall it is an ill conceived device that has many shortcomings.  Unlike many, I did not have any mounting issues, but then I am handy with tools.  However for the price I will keep it for use as an additional on demand security camera, that works on same app as my Blink xt2 Cameras.  In fact it is at a  lower price point than the individual wireless Blink  outdoor cameras anyway, and does the same thing from what I see.  But it's pretty worthless as a ""video doorbell,""  because its too much trouble to bring up the video or still picture.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2021"
183,Ashiq Chu,Design Disappointment- Rectified!,"  With high expectation and good experience with Blink's products, the unit came in with backplate that cannot snap easily with the unit, huge disappointment, initially. Then, we decided to contact Blink's Support Dept., and surprisingly, the responses from Blink were prompt and to the point of solving the issues at hand. Kudos to their customer service dept.. A 5 Stars Dept..  We discovered, after receiving a few models of backplates from Blink, we found the most basic one with no weather wrap protection fits our doorbell unit the best and easily reinstalled with no issue. To our surprise also, the Blink's doorbell camera angle is much wider and exceed the spectrum of the older ones than we had and can take good quality videos with harder to reach corners of our front porch easily viewable, an excellent feature of this camera for the doorbell. Highly Recommended. Then, Blink's rep. Haitham and Amera also offered added advises to add function of the doorbell with a separate sync module that will expand the features already in place for the doorbell unit.  Recommend getting the extra sync module unit for more great functions to record and arm features. In summary, Blink has an excellent customer support unit with thorough understanding on how to solve customer' issues, problems and questions, which allow Blink's products to be top on our list to acquire in the future.

184,tailu66,I'm tired,"  Brought this over from my Blink Mini review.I'm at a loss. We've had two different ""pet"" cameras for a similar cost (the mini alone), and while they've had their issues leading to me looking else where after a bit of use, Blink is just as bad in its own way.Mini was for indoor use, and doorbell was for outdoor (less about the doorbell, more about finally having a camera that works at night) plus needing the sync module that came with it. I didn't want to get trapped in their subscription so I cancelled the trial immediately to know what it would look like with the sync module and local storage. It's kind of weird that it's a USB when, again, cheaper pet cameras have better SD card options but I'll take what I can get here to try. Plenty of people have covered how it's a ploy to get you to have their subscription that you can't record live view (ie, you get a notification about motion, watch it, someone's breaking into your house, but because you're watching it live it doesn't save) but I didn't get my cameras for notifications. We have too much street traffic for motion detection to matter.That being said, I do WANT motion detection. But the doorbell doesn't do this consistently for humans in the least, and the Mini won't stay connected to the internet long enough to watch even me walk inside. All the cars when I had the doorbell out front? Totally. The raccoon that walked two feet in front of it? Super delayed on when it started to record, but sure. When I walk in my own drive way? Nah. I have to be moving the camera to be recorded. I drove ALL THE WAY up my driveway (it's long) and it didn't start recording until my car was already halfway in the garage. I get that some of the issue may have to do with ""battery saving"", but I feel like I'm asking for the bare minimum when it comes to proper recordings.The Wi-Fi connection also almost makes no sense to me, specifically for the Mini. The doorbell has worked on the front door, and on the garage which again is looong and quite a ways from the house. But the Mini? Works in one place in the house. And not even at the halfway point of what the doorbell works with. Even the cheapo pet cameras I mentioned had better Wi-fi connectivity in ALL the positions I tried in the house.I think the Mini probably has a chance of recording more consistently than the Doorbell, but the Doorbell is the one that stays connected to the Wi-fi. Like I'm considering using the doorbell inside when we go places (I literally haven't bothered mounting it with how much inconsistency there's been). But I really finally wanted something for outside, too.I'm tired. I'm not even someone totally needing this for feeling like our house is safe and yet it IS supposed to be a security system. For me it's more to keep an eye on neighbors who keep using our yard for stuff but I would really, really love something that works for peace of mind for the unknown, too. I just don't think that with all our technology, it exists for a reasonable cost.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2022"
185,Kindle Customer,DONT BUY ANY BLINK PRODUCTS.,"  I have 4 cameras and the door bell and they all have the same issue uploading and delay. I made sure they all have as much connection to WiFi and the little blink module yet as you can see in the pictures they have full connection to both.Had the cameras for about two years and the door bell for a few months. this past year they been so bad.. replaced batteries, reset system, updates as much as possible and it just got worse with every update. Makes me wonder if they purposely make stuff fail so they want you to buy their new equipment. NEVER AGAIN.Whatever happened with the updates this whole system is terrible. There is 1 to 5 minute delay in alerts or even trying to view live video which, rarely works, making it pointless. Non of the cameras record longer than 1 second even though it’s selected to record 10s. I cannot wait to replace this system and never will I ever buy a product from them again.Not only do they barely record they also have terrible playback and sometime don’t record anything.

I checked the app, and saw a man who was not in a sane state of mind had come to my door. I also saw that the same man had come to my door 35 minutes prior (I didn’t receive a notification about that even though I have motion detection turned on, so that’s an issue with the Blink app). I called the police, and when the cops arrived, I was able to show them the videos I had of the man so they could see what he was wearing (or not wearing since the man removed his tshirt between the first and second visits to my door), and see his behavior. I was home alone when the man came to my door, and the whole ordeal was terrifying. But having the doorbell take video so I could see the man without having to open my door or interact with him in any way, and being able to provide video evidence to the cops was a really good thing in the middle of a terrible situation.

187,Customer,Not bad for the price,"  I would give a 3.5 if I could. I just couldn't say it was a 4 star but it is just a tiny bit better than average. 4 star to me means very solid and I'm nitpicking on some small issues but the motion detection at night and unable to change volume separately are pretty big issues to me.Pros:- much cheaper than Ring doorbell- integrates pretty easy with Alexa- Simple to add to my existing Blink account- nice wide angle viewCons:*** Unable to control ringing volume separately on an Echo device, like you would with an alarm. It seriously needs this feature. I set it up for my father and he has a hard time hearing the chime. ***- like the Blink outdoor camera, its night time motion detection is very limited, like within 10-15ft- sometimes when depressing button, it does not ring even though you felt the click so needs a more robust push. Hopefully that doesn't mean this will break soon.- having to use a black mount on a white doorbell. Overall, it doesn't look too bad but I can't believe they do not offer the mounts in white.Wishlist:Control volume of chime on the doorbell itselfChange chime on the doorbell itselfBetter motion detection at nightUpdate:A representative from Blink was kind enough to reach out due to my review and even offered the white corner mount sent to me at no cost. I refused as it is already mounted, doesn't look too bad and there is no reason to throw more plastic away but it was much appreciated. They also said you can now control the chime volume on the doorbell itself which is great. The only thing left for me is to be able to control separately the volume of the doorbell on the Echo devices.

Hopefully a new firmware update can happen to rectify this and I will increase my stars happily.The mounting wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. Total installation time for .e was 5 minutes, 1.5 minutes of that was the mount.

But I thought I was going to break it with how hard I was pushing down.It was working pretty well for a few days and but for some reason it only did one announcement via Alexa, and then never again. Slowly it stopped doing motion sensing, then I couldn't do thumbnails and finally couldn't do live views. So it was basically dead.

189,TombRaider,"Easy to set up, hard to install","  I would like to preface this review with the fact that I might have made the install a bit hard for myself by attempting to place the device too close to my siding. However before I tried to install the device, I was trying to put it together on my desk and was struggling to get the clips of the front part of the device to clip onto the back. At the time, I figured it was just too hard to do without the back screwed into a wall but it was just as hard during the install and I was constantly concerned that I was forcing the clips too hard such that they would break or I was not forcing it hard enough for them to catch especially after I pulled the device off my wall without the security tab the first time.The device seems to work great as I get a notification each time I ring the bell from the app, but I am concerned how long the batteries will last and how will I replace the batteries when they die out considering how much I struggled to install it the first time. Add the fact that you have to pay a monthly fee to save clips in the cloud or buy a sync module and deal with the laggy communication and this doorbell will only serve secondary door duty as I would never use this doorbell for my main door.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2021"

I might have to put my Ring doorbell back on the door.Edit: After I contacted blink support they reached out to me and as I requested the live view to be automatically shown on Amazon echo the representative mentioned ""I am sure, you will see improvement in the near future"". So I am hopeful that a software update will fix it. So I have increased my rating from 1 star to 3 stars as other than the live view this product is pretty good.

191,Chris,"Used to love Blink Products, but not this! Too much Pay-to-Play!","  Purchased this after having a Blink XT camera system for a few years. While I love the Blink doorbell itself, Amazon has lost their marbles with their new ""Pay-to-Play"" business model. Bottom line, this camera will not record video unless you have a Blink Subscription (currently around $30 a year) AND you cannot set arm/disarm schedules unless you purchase and link it to a sync module. ALSO - you cannot link one camera to two separate Blink accounts, therefore all family members have to use the same account....The camera itself is great and the wired integration to my existing doorbell and power supply worked flawlessly. Unfortunately, Amazon's money-grabbing ways backs the capabilities of this camera into a corner, so it's really only useful if someone walks up to it, pushes the button, and you immediately pick up your wireless device to see who is at the door. Unless you buy into their subscriptions, the camera won't save any recordings, so if you aren't home and someone rings the door bell, you have to catch the app notification immediately or you'll never know who it was.Disgusting to say the least - disappointed in Amazon and will no longer be purchasing Blink products.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2022"
192,Chris,So far so good!,"  We had a Ring Doorbell camer as well as the flood/security camrea and decided to give Blink a try. Our main reason for switching was the ability to integrate it with Alexa. We had an older first gen doorbell, so it wasn't compatible. For the price, we could get more cameras from Blink than go with Ring. Our Ring camera batteries were starting to constantly drain within 30 days. We had bought replacement batteries at $30 each and they were still running down just as fast. Blink does not have the people detector that Ring has, but for us this wasn't a big factor. We are concerned about any motion activity regardless. The first thing we noticed is that the field of view is a little more zoomed in on the doorbell camera than wht the Ring was, which is great because we can get a clearer view of faces. The sound quality is so much better. The installation was so simple and quick! We have ordered two more cameras from Blink and the Alexa Show so we can utilize that functionality as well. The subscription plan is the same cost as what Ring is for unlimited cameras, which was another reason why we decided to go with Blink.

Easy install, for those that complained about how hard it was to snap the doorbell to the back plate - try a little silicon grease on the seal.  Snaps right on.The Good -  great picture and it rings the old school doorbell.  That's really about it I guess its a solid value for ~$50.  But...The Bad - it hooks up to the house wiring, but does NOT use that as a power source!? That makes no sense.  As I said I have 3 blink sec cameras on a dusk to dawn schedule.  Well after adding the doorbell, I assumed you could create different schedule.  You can't, so I ether have my door bell only armed at night :-/ or I have the other 3 cameras armed all day (and get a TON of movement notifications)  - Neither works.  Lastly, they include a little ""special key"" to remove the doorbell (remember you will have to change the batteries!).  Well a small screwdriver works just as well, so not really a key and some one could steal your door bell.These limitations may be fine for others it wasn't for me.Anyway - Like I said I really wanted this to work, but its going back and I am upgrading to a newer Ring.UPDATE 11/16/21 - I have upped this to 4 stars based on customer service and support(via email, the phone guys are trying but reading from a document so no real knowledge).

Bought this doorbell to go with our little bevy of Blink cameras.  Had no problem with install and adding to our grouping.  As suggested, put it in Sync Module mode without any trouble.The issue is - when someone rings the doorbell there is a couple second delay in sending a notification to our devices.  Not a big issue you say? Wrong.  Then the little counter spins indefinitely while it tries to connect to the camera/doorbell so you can (1) Actually see who is at the door and (2) have a two way communication with your guest.  After many experimentations - the quickest we could get our devices to connect to the doorbell was a full 2 minutes.  Not sure about you, but I'm not waiting on someone's doorstep longer than 20 seconds.  By the time we made the connection - the person and their car would have been long gone.Just troubleshoot you say?  Should be a simple fix?  Another big Debbie-Downer.

Video feed was slow and app crashed.I also can’t for example just have echo play a doorbell sound( setting up  from the device gear in Alexa app), it has to be accompanied by Alexa speaking and announcing someone is at the “front door”.Setting up the routine is equally frustrating and Blink website instructions only tell you to setup a routine using “message”. I believe this is because if you try and setup an Alexa routine with a sound you can only choose 1 echo (which isnt good for anyone that wants to hear it at multiple locations like basement or bedroom in a house.So… I also bought this on Black Friday special and it arrived with broken backplate tabs. Amazon will NOT honor their replacement terms and would only offer to refund $60 even though the same product and package is available on Amazon.

196,ROBERT L.,Constant Problems,"  Updated, AGAIN.  I purchased a total of 7 new Blink cameras. 3 solar units, two Floodlights and 2 new Doorbell Cams. I had been a long time Arlo user but wanted to upgrade my system. What I ended up doing was downgrading and introducing problems into my home security system. In the month that I’ve had these AWS/Blink servers have gone down 3 times causing the cameras to be completely non functional, one time for an entire day. That’s unacceptable in and of itself. Since these outages the lag time has been terrible, taking anywhere from 6+ seconds to load a cameras live stream or timing out completely. When you receive an alert and try to view the camera live by the time it decides to load any activity will have likely already passed by the camera. All cameras have both full WiFi signal and full signal to the sync module so it’s not an issue on my side of things. This morning I noticed one of my Solar units said the batteries needed to be replaced (the expensive Lithium AA batteries). This specific Solar camera is in a position that gets sun any time it’s out and is also in the least activity area, only receiving maybe 1-2 alerts a day and other days 0 alerts. I’m not sure if the rechargeable battery inside is bad, the Solar panel doesn’t work or what but I’ve had enough with the problems in the very short amount of time I’ve had this system.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2021"
197,Mike Schultz,It works.,"  I don’t have any complaints that are dealbreakers at this price point. I wanted a doorbell which is what I got. I like that it can be connected to the echo show and alerts you that someone is at the door. Seems to be much quicker than the blink camera that was in the same area to alert you of motion. Especially the app. Alexa has a slight delay. If someone pushes the button, the Alexa  announcement is a couple seconds behind. The app takes you straight to live view if the notification is tapped and you are able to catch someone and talk to them before they walk away. Setting up a routine with the echo show will automatically open live view too if you choose. A little slower but not bad. Much faster then asking Alex to show you.Yes, getting the doorbell attached to the mounting plate took a minute to figure out but figure that’s not a bad thing. At least it’s secure.  People are a little dark in the video so assume some front light would help offset all of the backlight but you can make people out.I haven’t had any other video doorbell and understand there’s others that have more bells and whistles. I also don’t have a regular doorbell either so adding this to a system I already have that is much cheaper than the others and alerts me when someone pushes the button is great!",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2021"

Overall I would say I like the Blink system, but my headline is my number one gripe. I bought this expecting that I would be able to record to the USB drive connected to the sync 2 module for free. THIS IS NOT THE CASE. You MUST pay for a subscription plan to record. There is a free plan, but that only includes live view, and motion ALERTS. NO RECORDING. Doesn't matter if you have the sync module with a USB drive or not, all new cameras must have a subscription plan to record. 10 bucks a month for unlimited cameras. I don't know if it's worth it honestly. The motion detection doesn't really put it in that subscription price range for me. I would rather have one of the actual alarm options out there for around the same price.  I probably will just stick with the free plan, or I may even return them. I'm not sure yet. I'm going to look at the other options out there.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2021"
200,NanaBecky,Simple setup and operation,"  This is a very simple setup, ...identical to any other blink cameras you may have.  If you don't have blink cameras, they are quite simple to install and adjust settings,...to include sensitivity.  I don't use Alexa, so I can't answer any Q's on that.The unit synced right up once I scanned the QR code.  I used the existing wiring from the push button only doorbell, which screws onto the back of this unit.  Adjusting the activation time so the chime cycled completely was easy and adjusting the motion is again, just like a standard blink camera.Mounting the camera may require a bit of mechanical skill if you have never used a hammer drill on concrete/stucco finishes to install the anchors.  But, your previous door bell screw holes may line up?In my pic, you can see this unit is smaller than my previous designer doorbell plate mounts.  I just need to do a bit of paint touch up.  **Note: Just a suggestion, you receive a small release tool to undo the unit from the mount to change the 2 batteries (provided).  Simply use a ziplock sandwich bag, mark it, and put it in a close by drawer.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2022"
201,Tyrion,Superb quality and performance,"  First let me say this, the package arrived 1 day earlier than expected. I’m not tech savvy but the instructions help me get me through the setup. I missed the step about how to synchronize the doorbell with my existing door chime so I was bummed. I retraced the steps and realized I missed a step and redid the setup. After synching my doorbell with the door chime it all worked. I didn’t need to have the existing doorbell installed. Don’t forget to go pay through the setup and SAVE YOUR SETTINGS. Mounting on a flat surface was a cinch. No problems as it was stated in other reviews. When I refer you o instructions, I’m referring to the instructions in the online setup, not paper instructions. All in all the setup was easy and the quality is what I was looking for in a doorbell camera. In my opinion it beats the more expensive Ring version. I’ve since added to three more cameras to the house and the quality and performance is superb. The only cons are you can only view through one camera at a time and I haven’t been able to share the live videos on more than one phone. If anybody knows how this can be done let me know.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 24, 2021"
202,Adam M,So So many issues!!,"  I bought 2 blink camera and a doorbell. I've used Nest and Ring in the past.  Upon setting it up, I had issues with the app on my phone and was not able to use it. I called Blink twice and no one answered, rather it sent me to a voicemail both times and asked that I leave my info and someone would call me back which they never did. I sent an email regarding the same issue and did not hear back from that either.  So I set it up on a friend's phone just to get it up and running since I was about to leave town and needed the camera service on while I was gone.  The day I left the cameras all went out and I could not see them on my app (which I set up and figured out without any help from Blink who never returned my calls).  After a whole day of the camera being off, we called again and finally spoke with someone. They said I had to be home to reset the device for them to be turned on.  How unfortunate for me though, I bought them and installed them just in time for me to not be home to reset anything.  I've used Nest for about 7 years and in all that time they have not gone out once that I needed to be at my house to reset them.  So these security cameras that are suppose to help you monitor your property when you are away or asleep may just go out and you'll need to be present to fix them....and then, good luck getting a hold of anyone there when you do need help.

203,Marek,Good so far!,"  Since I already had blink cameras and an extra sync module it made sense to go with the blink doorbell. I read all the reviews both good and bad and decided to purchase.ProsInstallation was straight forward. Easy to follow steps on the app.Setup for everything is done on app and easy to modify if needed*was concerned about the reviews that said you have to remove the seal to get the bell to lock into place. I discovered it is a two hand process. You have to press firmly on the top and bottom of the bell and slide it down.Also was concerned about the mention of it being plastic mounting brackets. We live in Florida so it won’t take long to be destroyed by the sun if it’s going to be.Cons:Even though it is wired it still requires batteries. Last Honeywell doorbell didn’t require batteries.No way to turn off one thing attached to sync module. It’s all on or off. Consider this if you have cameras.No option to record continuously. Being battery operated it wouldn’t last long, but other blink items are plugged in and still no option.Overall I have been happy with my blink cameras and doorbell.

So glad this finally launched.Installation was super quick and easy. I have mine wired into the original doorbell, so it runs off wired power and uses my physical chime box that came with the house.

205,Kouros,Beware-- they want you to pay a subscription for the doorbell,"  The cameras work fine with the local storage (i.e. the sync module). However, for the doorbell, they will want you to pay one of the plans or you will be greeted with the message:""The doorbell is not recording because you do not have a blink storage plan""This is of course unless you have a plan from April 2020.The other aspect is that the motion detection is not very good, it misses the first 5 or 7 seconds of action...this is true for the cameras as well. If you think about it, 5 seconds is a long time when recording a video (count from 1 to 5 Mississippi) . So for the most part I am catching the back of the delivery person (or potential thieves) -- It seems like a nice and stylish product...but I think I am returning the whole thing.- I was not expecting the performance hit or the forceful payment schema form Amazon --All the bestGCUpdate:After trial and error, I realized that you should add the doorbell to your existing system (if you have the cameras) and not create a new one, unless you have a different module.That will allow the videos to be saved to the USB card",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2021"
206,Jordynn,Great doorbell camera and easy to set up,"  I added the doorbell camera to my Blink XT2 system without too much trouble.  I read that getting the back on after mounting is a bit of a hassle and noticed that it is offset about a 1/4 inch or so into the frame.  I used some weather stripping to push the doorbell frame away from wall about a 1/4 inch and it worked pretty well.  Took a bit a maneuvering to slip on and off, but since I wired mine I won't have to take it off very much and not worried bout it.  The camera acts pretty much like the cameras do, so I was familiar enough to set it up quick.  It is a bit late on motion detection when the object is straight on, but my yard is setup that side to side would be most likely route.  I already had a camera on the door, and I have just left it along with the doorbell.  This get my coverage much better than just one and works for me.  The doorbell is better for communicating than what the camera is and the camera does a better job of picking up movement and some aspects of clarity.  All in all, I am happy with Blink Xt2 and the new doorbell I added.

207,AmazonFanatic,A great idea that will hopefully get better over time.,  I bought one of these when they were first announced and was pretty stoked about it.  The price is perfect and if you have other blink cameras you can add this to the system with no problem.Installation was pretty easy and what I expected but don't lose the little tool that comes with it to remove the front to change the batteries if you need too.  It's a little tricky to get the back off if you need.The one thing I can say that I really don't like and makes this a little less useful is that if someone rings the door bell and you use the app or your Alexa show device to see who's there it fails 90% of the time.Seeing video of who was at the door after the fact works but by then it's really a little to late to talk to them.  Some time when trying to update the settings if fails to update and some times when you are trying to view live video it fails.  Motion detection works great but the feature that allows you to mask off areas so they don't trigger doesn't seem to work.But all in all not a bad thing to spend $50 on.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2021"
208,Libby,Good value for money,"  I purchased the bundle containing the doorbell, snych module, and corner bracket (which I didn't need). The assembly instructions were a bit confusing, with several sets of often vague instructions available in printed and electronic form. But finally everything came together OK despite my spotty assembly skills.Attaching the doorbell to the door bracket was a bit tricky, as others have noted. I found that aligning the top of the doorbell with the top of the bracket so that they are touching, then pushing in and down works fairly smoothly. Removal of the doorbell with the supplied key is easy.The synch module readily logged into wifi and I had no difficulties with the phone app and video playback and storage. But it has only been a week. I plugged a flash drive into the synch module, so we'll see how that works for local storage when my free cloud subscription expires.All in all, a functional video doorbell at a good price--better if you bundle and get it on sale. Only apparent drawbacks are unclear installation instructions and some difficulty installing doorbell, as noted.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2021"
209,R Cagno,The backing mount IS TRASH,"  Love the device etc., BUT the baking mount literally takes forever to attach. It's complete garbage if it takes me an hour to attach the camera to the backing.

It shouldn't be such a pain in the ass to setup from app download to physically attaching it. Get it together BLINK. I want to return it but I'm gonna have to macgyver this b!tch.UPDATE:Blink has very responsive reps that care about their products. I had a nice exchange for a replacement to be sent. Although I didn't require it since I figured out a way to stabilize the backing with my unit, I did mention that a customizable solution for when people are shopping online on Amazon can cater their backing mount options to their door. Blink offers an angled corner backing that I wasn't aware of and wasn't shown through search results via Amazon's algorithm.

My router & blink module are right on the other side of the wall. No change in static noise in all videos. Amazon sent me a replacement which I just installed. Fortunately it is a breeze to setup. Unfortunately the static is still there & slightly louder.I am keeping the doorbell because I love Blink, hoping that there will be a software update at some point to resolve the static sound.Also, Blink please update to allow the doorbell lighted ring to glow a bit at night.

211,Busted Knuckle,Blink Security Camera Users need look no further…,"  First, lets sum this up by saying this is a fantastic option for Alexa smart home users and Blink Users, for those familiar enough with the Amazon/Alexa ecosystem you can set this up many ways in your smart home. If your a Blink Camera Security user this is a no brainer. Installation is a breeze, I used my existing wires from my current hardwired doorbell and it worked perfect (Turn off power at the circuit breaker). Doorbell is pressed, the guest hears a chime at the doorbell itself, and the original indoor chime works on the wall as it always has. There is even the ability to adjust your electronic or piston based wall mounted powered doorbell from within the app to get the best sound from your bell (genius). That’s the easy and straightforward part, this is when the fun begins. The doorbell itself can be set in various configurations. It can be set/armed along with your outdoor cameras and notify you as well as record when it senses motion, with the same settings to record as your standard cameras. You can also set and customize motion zones as well as privacy zones in it’s field of view (nice features). IR intensity, recording time, trigger time, end recording early, it’s all there. There are also a series of actions you can set for when the actual doorbell is pressed, or it sees motion. For example, if the doorbell senses motion at the door you can set Alexa devices in the house (you choose which ones) to announce that someone is at the front door, or in addition you can have it play one of a half dozen or more “chimes” that play right on the Alexa device of your choice which are selectable within the Alexa App (Echo speakers, Fire TV, Echo Video Screens, etc). For video enabled devices, you can also have the live video feed start automatically and you can enjoy two way audio as you speak with your visitor. This also works on your cell phone while away from the house. For those with Alexa “Auto”, these notifications can be set to announce there as well. For those looking to take things further, motion or a button press on the doorbell can also be used to set custom actions within your smart home, turning lights on, Changing a Hue light’s color, etc.. you have many many actions. As an example, I have mine set to Turn on the front outside lights (at certain times of the day to give the visitor a visual cue that the house is aware they are there), I have Alexa play a customized notification on three Alexa devices in the house (Verbally announcing what I typed it to say, have fun with this one), and a custom Chime (in addition to my house doorbell). It also sends notifications to my phone, my car, and records the visitor. Original Blink buyers continue to enjoy free cloud storage as with their other cameras, and if you install and use the most recent sync module, you can choose to record locally for the doorbell off the USB port to a Drive. I also have the ability to answer the door either manually or if I set it automatically off the FireTV in the livingroom.. Bottom line, the Amazon ecosystem gives you an almost unlimited amount of customizations for your smart home if you choose, including the ability to automatically turn on outside and inside lights (you select which ones) when someone comes to the front door based on either motion, or a doorbell press. I find the video quality to be quiet good keeping in mind this is a fisheye setup, the IR light is strong enough for people at the door, daytime quality is great, sensitivity is great, sound is great. While there is a delay when speaking I find it more that acceptable (around 1-2 sec), much better than what you experience when using the outdoor cameras speaker function (Which do not provide two way audio like the doorbell). I would recommend those buying the camera to buy the wedge/corner mount to properly aim the camera towards where the person is likely to be standing, but this is not a must have depending on your door. I also found mounting to be very easy, secure (if they really want it they are going to get it, but your likely to have video of who took it anyway), and despite the negative comments about mounting the slide-on camera it was super easy and secure (not sure why some are having issues, there are no issues).

212,Joshua,"Good features, but crummy mounting.","  I bought this because I am already committed to the Blink Ecosystem (I have five cameras), so I figured this was a no-brainer.While it works pretty well, I'm less than impressed with the mounting.  Mine came with the corner tab (a must because my doorbell would otherwise be looking at the back of a decorative pillar), and the installation of the corner mount made the whole system a mess.  The mount screws make it kind of flimsy, and the doorbell unit itself was a pain to mount.  Sure, I could go buy other screws (which it looks like I will have to do, but it should have just been better designed.  The corner mount made the whole doorbell less than awesome as an experience.Also, the requirement that I need to press the doorbell to ""arm"" it after enabling it is poorly thought out.  I want to be able to arm/disarm my whole system remotely.  If I remember to arm it after-the-fact when I leave the house, it now will not work unless someone pushes the doorbell (or it waits a full 24 hours).

213,Norberto Luis,Wait for the tech to mature,"  First of all, I'm not a fan of needing a subscription for a camera. There's no reason why this device shouldn't have limited local storage.The doorbell is WAY too big. It is massive when comparing to other doorbell cameras. It's also very easy to remove without the included tool (which is good because you're going to lose it right after you install it). This makes it less secure unless you have other cameras.Unlike competitors, the device cannot be shared with other blink accounts, so you need to share your blink account with your household if you want everyone to receive notifications.Alexa integration works BUT you cannot set it to chime only. It will always follow the chime with ""Someone is at the door"".When it rains, the lens is very prone to fogging up.Lastly, when setting the activation zones, it's inversed from Ring. Instead of selecting the zones you want motion detected, you select the zones to exclude from motion detection. It took me a couple weeks to figure that out.Overall, wait for the next version or just get a Ring.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2022"
214,queenie,Horrible Battery Life and Over Priced Mounts,"  It's a decent camera but not really worth the money even at low cost.Let's just talk about the 13 dollar angled mounting plate that should come free with it.  Way to nickle and dime your customers even more Blink over something so cheap.It's outright horribly delayed for its motion detection also.  But that's common with all of their cameras so it was expected.  As far as customization goes and recording times it's the same as the rest of their cameras,  horrible.Update - After owning this for over a month it's still extremely disappointing.  It does a great job of picking up cars in an area that has already been blocked for motion detection and almost never triggers in a timely manner for someone at my door.  Sometimes it doesn't even record even if someone has rung my doorbell.Now I see why they didn't release this year's ago.

215,Robert in NW Florida,UPDATED - reinstalled a second unit,"  UPDATE - Blink support reached out to me after my initial review and offered to send me a replacement free of charge.  They took the initial feedback seriously.  After receiving my second camera and mount, I installed the mount using my own screws meant for hardi-plank siding.  This worked fine.  When the mount bracket and back are solid and stable, the camera clicks on fairly easily.  Doorbell camera is now up and running.  It integrates nicely into my echo with video.I was able to wire it in the existing doorbell spot and it controls my chime as expected.I plan to use it for a while and then add more to the review.I'm changing my initial review from one to four stars.  I'm found this solely on the effort from support.  Haitham with Blink went above and beyond to make sure I got taken care of.  Much appreciated!!--- Original Review --Let me first say I've had blink cameras for almost three years now.  I've been happy with the blink system and camera function.I patiently waited for a doorbell to add to the system. I was excited when one finally was released.  Then I got it...First off, Amazon needs to realize that people mounting these with screws are likely putting them into fiberboard cement siding.  I got the angled mount (which should come with the camera but doesn't) and they give you two teeny tiny machine screws to mount it.  To your house.  So right away I had to go find different screws.  Fine.  No big deal.  Got it mounted and moved on.Next they tell you to mount the camera cover.  The hardware that they send for this job is so soft you can practically squish it between your thumb and finger!  Every turn of the screw you can just see the metal coming off.  By 6 or 7 turns, I couldn't tell it was a Phillips screw anymore.  When I got the bottom one snug, the head of the screw just broke clean off in the mount rendering it useless.I thought maybe I could make it work with one screw but like others mentioned you have to be Bobby Fischer to figure out how to get the camera to slide onto the back.  I tried several times and finally gave up, shoved it back in the box and returned it.  Save yourself a headache and just mount one of the outdoor cameras above your door.

With the blink doorbell we can actively see what’s in front of our door before we get home to make sure it’s safe.With remote work now I get to see when packages get delivered from any room I have our echo show which integrated easily. I did have to unpair and reconnect the blink to get the notifications working on the show but it’s awesome. We love the many rings you can choose from and ability to track motion in the hallways before we leave our apartment too.I did a bit of research before and the other brands were more than twice the price so we thought we’d give this a chance first and are really happy with our decision.The mounting was a big finnacky but got it mounted without too much work.it isn’t the most secure and with a little force people could rip it off but is definitely be able to get a photo of them if they did.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2022"

On the other hand if you have other blink cameras, the lack of control over alerts makes the doorbell worthless. I have three indoor cameras and six outdoor cameras plus the doorbell. In order to get motion alerts from the doorbell I also have to accept  motion alerts from the other cameras. No thank you. My phone would never stop. Also, the Alexa integration is spotty for the entire Blink ecosystem. Sometimes asking to see a camera gets me an image in a few seconds, sometimes I just get the wait wheel of death.

218,Fenwick Boys,Needs better design,"  I read the reviews and figured it came from folks that weren't skilled at following instructions.  Most  reviews implied the actual doorbell was hard to mount to the back plate.  I received the unit and followed the instructions and, yes, the doorbell was very hard to mount.  In fact, it took several attempts.  Looking closely at the design, I came to the conclusion that the small plastic tabs that hold the two pieces together could easily get bent.  In addition, my unit did work but, not for long.  After a long call with customer support, the technician determined I had a defective unit and my unit needed to be replaces.  Blink team shipped a new unit quickly and I installed the next day.  The replacement unit was even worse in terms of ""ease of installation"".  I ended up removing the back plate and, after further inspection, determined that there was simply an alignment problem.  I ended up bending plastic tabs so that the doorbell would snap in place to the back plate.  Conclusion:  Blink could have made this very simple by designing a unit that could be mounted using two screws at the top and bottom of the doorbell itself.  Other than that, I am pretty satisfied with the unit but, I wish the response time was a little faster.  Seems like there is a lag time between the motion detection alert and when we can view the video.  I won't be to critical because it could be the placement of my router.

219,B. Sands,Works Great! but......,"  Easy Installation, though I have to say, they could figure out an easier way to attach and disconnect the doorbell to the mounting bracket. You have to use the included key to disconnect it from the base to change the batteries, see the serial number at set up, etc. I had to disconnect it several times to trouble shoot why my voice was cracking and distorted when speaking through it. The reason it only gets two stars is because blink is having an issue with the latest Android update (12) and this is what is causing the voice feature to not work. If you have an IOS device, you will have no problem. So for now, if you are an Android user, I would not recommend this device. I have spoken with Blink support and they are aware and are working on the issue, from what I can tell, they have been working on the issue for months, there are forums with people experiencing the same problem.

No, it's NOT 4k video. No, it's not 8k video either. Doesn't need to be either, and does not cost nearly what I am paying for 4k outdoor cameras either. The entire Blink ecosystem is quality product at a good price. While this may sound like a paid testimonial , believe me I can show you paid receipts for the 4 blink doorbell cameras i have purchased so far, along with the several dozen blink battery operated and mini blinks I own. The only negative i have seen so far is the lack of a temperature sensor built in, something also left off the mini blinks, but included on most other blinks.

The Ring Doorbell cameras were offline more than they were online ( at least 75% ""offline"" ) and required one of their proprietary chimes to sound off inside the house. The Blink Doorbell cameras have yet to go ""offline"" and correctly ring the built-in house chimes that are easily over 50 years old - 1 bell for back and 2 bells for front. I have 6 additional Blink cameras - 3 minis and 3 outdoor - for which I pay $10 per month for cloud storage and the 2 doorbells added nothing more to the subscription... and I stopped the $3 per camera ( $6 per month ) the two Ring Doorbells were costing me for sporadic service.

Between the two the Ring is the best for video, notifications and ease of app use. For the price point of Blink it’s definitely worth it though. The Blink functions perfectly, I like that it takes a standard battery size (non-hardwired version) and it definitely does the job. The Ring has their own special battery type (rechargeable). The Blink notifications and videos are a bit odd on the feed when going back over previous alerts - sometimes one is marked as not viewed when either I know I saw it earlier or it was never there before. The app is a bit convoluted but manageable for the settings (no where as easy as the Ring app). All in all for the price point I’m not complaining and would recommend it.

I received the item(s) quickly, came in great condition. The setup was pretty straightforward, scan the qr code on the blink app, no problem. The wifi issue is most likely my wifi(s) fault, I do have an extender but it's still giving me issues. I was not impressed with the doorbell cam AT ALL. It's cheap, flimsy plastic, but that one connects pretty easily and the daytime picture is clear, nighttime is not great, that goes for all of them, night ""vision"" is blurry and static, the sound also has these weird intervals were it sounds like footsteps? Idk how to describe it. Overall I'm not absolutely displeased but I was expecting a clearer nighttime picture/video and some other features. The outdoor cameras take 2AA batteries, battery life so far seems good even after using them frequently.

225,BM,Doesn't show video automatically with doorbell ring,"  When someone rings the doorbell, it tells you on your phone and the Echo makes a sound (like any doorbell), however it doesn't show the video until you ask it to.  When you ask it to show the video, it takes another 10 seconds to load the video.  Seems like by the time you get to Alexa & ask to see the video & it finally loads, the  person at the door has already left.  Pointless.You are able to create a ""Routine"" that will show the doorbell automatically, but it won't stop showing the doorbell video until you ask it to stop.  There doesn't seem to be a way to tell it to show a finite amount of video, as the ""show me the doorbell"" command has to be the last one.If what you want is a motion detection camera, this does the trick.  If you were expecting this to be a video doorbell when combined with an echo, then I give it 1 star.I updated to 3 stars based on interaction with tech support - they definitely stand by their products.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2021"

227,Steven C.,Idk why all the bad reviews?!,"  So to make a long story kinda shorter I live in apartments and my mom is disabled, she walks slower and with a cane and she can’t see well. Well some little kids always knock on our door and run, it’s funny to them bc she takes longer to get to the door so they can take off with out getting caught. Well the completely crossed the line this time, they told her they had a free pizza for her but she declined and closed the door. They came back later and left a pizza box at the door and took off. The box was full of POOP the picked up from around the complex. Turns out they were hiding behind the tree to see our reaction. I tried to video them on my phone so I can report them but there was 5 kids and one of me so I couldn’t manage. So I immediately started looking at doorbell cams BUT obviously we don’t have doorbells in apartments so this option was perfect for me. You don’t wire anything just install the app, install your module and drill it on. I ordered a mount but It actually comes with one. It took me 5 mins to set up on my phone and 6 mins to install outside. I love this. I will be buying the subscription when my free trial runs out, the basic plan is $3. If you live in an apartment get this. I feel so much peace of mind now. I will update if anything happens / fails.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2022"
228,Cynthia,Mount is flimsy & breaks!,"  The basic doorbell is OK. It rings my phone & the closest indoor camera when someone presses the button. But it doesn't seem to alert me if someone is on my porch delivering something & they don't push the button. My main complaint is about the mounting plate that screws to the door frame. The doorbell unit clips on to this mounting with 6 tiny latches that lock into place. The problem is that 2 of them broke off when I was trying to snap the doorbell into place. The problem gets worse, because there doesn't seem to be a way to get this part, either paid or free from Amazon, & gets even worse with the 'tool' that is supposed to help you remove the doorbell from but doesn't. I guess in 2 years or less when the battery dies, I'll have to take a hammer & remove it by breaking it.  I like my Blink corded indoor camera & own 6 of them. The doorbell mounting design is poor & should be changed to a more robust design! I really can't recommend this unit.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2021"

It still announce motion detected (maybe) because the passing by vehicle headlight shine on my grass or bushes.Lowered sensitivity to 4 or 3 solved this problem but it sometimes missed Amazon delivery (they are fast and stayed in frame in a short time).The tech support was pretty responsive but refused to accept my support because I submitted mov file instead of mp4 file they wanted. First of all, they never asked/specified only mp4 will be accepted, secondly, the file was created directly from Blink app and the support says they are not in the business of video support...what an attitude!!

230,fminn,Highly unreliable,"  My experience with the blink doorbell has been pretty bad.  First I bought the stand alone version where I missed some of the restrictions on what you can do with the wireless version.  So I returned and upgraded to the version with the sync module.Since upgrading, my doorbell is more offline than online.  When it is online the live view only works about 10% of the time.  Sometimes it is online but just stops registering motion events.  I've contacted support who told me to try the usual things... Unmount and take the batteries out and put them back to restart it.  Move the sync module closer.  Restart the sync module.  These sometimes work and sometimes not.The sync module is 5 feet from the doorbell and about 15 feet from my access point.  Still highly unreliable.I have tried calling support but after waiting a long time it eventually tells me there is no one to take my call and it hangs up.  Email support takes several days to respond and then after explaining the issue they told me that my doorbell was not armed.  I replied it's not armed and that I cannot arm it because it's offline.  Tried resetting and it will now not even come online.  I sent that info to support and they replied with a link to an article on how to arm the doorbell.  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!Would return if I still had the box, but looks like it's just going into the trash can and I am eating 60$.Very disappointed the in this product and their support.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2022"
231,CB,So far so good,"  I've had the Blink wireless outdoor camera for about a year now.  Love that thing.  I've never had to replace the batteries in it since we purchased it.  Motion detection works great, storage is wonderful as the subscription price is fair in my opinion.As for the Blink Doorbell, we have only had it for about a week now and so far, I'd say it's good.  I have found that we prefer to have the motion detection turned off on the camera so we only receive recorded videos when someone rings the doorbell.  We are using our Alexa device as our doorbell sound inside our home, that was somewhat easy to set up.  Found plenty of information online as to how to do that.  Only negative thing i'd say is that it is very difficult to mount the camera itself to the mounting bracket if you do not know ahead of time what to do.  Once the bracket is mounted, you will need to line up the grooves on the back of the camera slightly higher than the ones on the mounting bracket so that you can FIRMLY slide the camera down and lock in into place.  A fair amount of force was required for this.Overall, we are happy so far.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2021"
232,Anthony Armato,"It works, but only with the sync module","  Update:(I was sent the sync module and now the doorbell works better. With the add on you have a live view which is very helpful. There is no reason to sell the doorbell without it. It does not work without the sync mod)I pre-ordered this and didn't get the wedge to help angle the product which would have been very helpful. The only thing I wish it had was a live view.  Update. I've had this for a month and find it to be nearly worthless. It takes too long to realize that it's seen something. By the time it notifies me and I look at what it's recorded nothing is there. I have gig internet so it's not that. I will have a delivery driver park in front of my house, walk up my driveway and drop the package in front of the door, walk down the driveway and leave and it doesn't start recording until the vehicle is gone. Then it says you have a live view but the action is gone. Plus I really wanted something that I could drop in on and see live because I wanted to not just because of a package.

233,Ed,I don’t have to open the door,"  There are many things to like about this product. I’ll get to all of them. The one specific for me may not be for everyone. I’m immunocompromised and don’t like strangers to come to the door and breathe on me during the pandemic. Most people are respectful. However, there are just a few times when you have to talk to someone at the front door. Now I don’t have to open the door. I can talk to them through the app from anywhere and complete my business without risking germs. This works for normal conversations with people at the door. You may find it useful for yourself.  Also, I have integrated the doorbell with my Alexa echo  and when the doorbell rings outside, Alexa says, “Someone is at the door.” You can learn how to do that with the email that they send you that talks about Alexa skills. The camera is sensitive enough without being overly sensitive. It’s also adjustable in many different ways, as are all of the Blink cameras.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2021"
234,Dee Ayala,Not Pretty but Smart,"  Trying to configure the system in the family room to install on a warmer day didn't go well. Everything went wrong but, to make a long story short, connection to doorbell wiring was what was needed. Once Blink was installed and connected to the doorbell wiring, features that were failing came online and I did some initial configuration and testing. A work in progress but motion detection settings and basic video and audio levels are at a good starting point. Hopefully, I'll be able to improve video quality but, too soon to tell.I found mounting on a flat surface would require more sophisticated installation than there was time for but it's secure and can be adapted, if needed, in better weather. It's in a protected area but I doubt it would be vulnerable to moisture. Sunlight? Don't know.I'm looking forward to fine tuning Blink's features but it's too soon to offer a detailed review.

235,Zack,Very Decent Camera for the Price,"  I am pretty satisfied with the Blink Video Doorbell. I am impressed with the video resolution at 1080p and the motion detection even if an object is about 10-12 feet away. Of course, this is all contingent on the sensitivity settings in the parameters in the Blink App  that is used in conjunction with the doorbell and Blink Cameras. Night vision is pretty good too. When you have adequate light at the door, such as a bright porch light the camera will pick up the brightness and give you video in color. The only thing I don’t like that I had to figure out is that if you want to talk to someone over the doorbell or cameras, you almost have to treat it as a walkie talkie. In other words, if on Blink App I enable the talk feature at that moment, even though I know there is about 2-3 second delay in receiving/responding time, you cannot hear the individual respond if the talk feature is enabled. Your enabling this feature supersedes the audio of the person at the camera. I figured that once I respond I have to disable the talk feature before I can really hear the person clearly. I’m actually thinking of getting a Ring Video Doorbell just to compare response time and voice clarity in communication. This is the only drawback I experienced. But for the price it’s a great deal.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2022"
236,Ray,Awesome video and doorbell!,"  This is a very attractive looking doorbell that feels very sturdy in the hand and installation was super easy! I am 6'2 and I mounted it slightly higher than the 48"" from the ground recommendation but because of it's very wide viewing angle, 48"" would have worked fine as well. It will definitely capture the visitors face and upper torso. The daytime image is super sharp and the motion showed zero lag when viewing the recording. This product is half the price of it's number one competitor and full of useful options and settings to suit every need. The moment someone rings the doorbell you are instantly notified via message on your phone and or any Amazon or Alexa device. I expect the batteries to last at least two years because I don't get many visitors and delivery drivers, although they come almost weekly because I'm a shopaholic, rarely ring the doorbell, which is the primary reason why I purchased it.

237,Ray,No need for a subscription with Sync 2,"  I originally left an angry review after learning about the subscription service for Blink. I did not want to continue paying $120 a year for a camera I already purchased. They are vague on their products and services but with the Sync 2 module you essentially get the same function as the subscription but without a few features they decided were ""premium"". With the module, and a mini USB drive, you still have all your triggered recordings saved and are able to access them from the app. One of the ""premium"" features you lose out on is being able to record while watching it live; so if someone is robbing your house, just dont watch them do it live or you wont have proof!!! (sneaky work around with recording live is to do a screen recording on your iphone while watching live in the app). I would rather see the Sync module cost a little more and have all the ""premium"" features built in for life but our cultural fad is to have a subscription for literally everything right now so that will never happen.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2022"
238,Squirrel,It's ok,"  It is ok. I got Blink because you could still use it without the subscription. I think they remove more features than necessary after the trial just to make it a pain in the butt to use without a subscription. For instance now I can't see a still shot of the motion clip.  I have to play it. Then I can no longer delete multiple clips. I have to do it individually. I can't record live view even though it would only save to my sim card. There is no reason for those features to be removed except to make it a pain in the butt. Motion detection is either too sensitive or not enough. Hard to find that best setting. I set the active area but still get trips on motion outside the zones. Alexa works most of the time saying ""somebody is at the front door."" The notification is slow and often delayed. By the time I get a motion alert and try to bring up live view, there is no more activity. Live view fails half the time anyway.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2022"
239,A Doll,Flimsy cheap,"  I purchased this because I switched from ring to blink because I could ditch the cloud subscription, so I thought. This thing is cheap garbage. It took me forever to figure this thing out. I chose to hard wire using my old doorbell wiring because I figured it would be best not to have to worry about replacing batteries. But that’s not the case. After a few YouTube videos and some digging, I came to realize that connecting it to your existing wiring only allows it to ring through your existing chime. Well that’s just dumb! It should also power the unit as well. But nope it doesn’t. Who needs a chime anyway if you have an Alexa, because when you ring the bell she chimes and says someone is at the door. I think I’m going to send this back along with all the cameras and sync module and whatever other blink junk that I’ve recently purchased. It may be good for some but it truly wasn’t good for me.

It works just like your other cameras and shows up in the app the same way. The motion detection works similarly to the other cameras, but the quality is a little sharper than my older blink cameras.My only issues are that it does work off the blink app and either your phone or Alexa, which means if you have your phone on silent, or in the other room, you may not hear somebody ringing your doorbell. It also has a slight delay, and there have been times where I don't think it even rang the first time.If you are wanting a solid doorbell replacement, I would recommend getting an Alexa screen or something that will be stationary and always on for when the doorbell is rang.

242,Austin,Love Blink Systems,"  We purchased our first Blink Home Security Camera July of 2018. We were going out of the country and wanted to make sure our 18 year old son closed the garage door and locked the house. It did the job and we felt better knowing while on the other side of the world we could monitor our home.The following Summer we were so happy with our indoor system, we decided to purchase 2 outdoor cameras with the 2 way audio, and were so happy with the video and audio quality, we bought another add on outdoor camera, the next month.A year later we found the mini indoor cameras. We have one for a child's bedroom and one for the playroom. The video and audio quality is great.A year after that we bought another 3 outdoor Cameras, again video and audio quality is great.Just before Christmas 2021 Blink came out with the doorbell camera, and we purchased it. One, because it was blink and 1/2 the price of a ring doorbell camera.

This can take a few days to work out the kinks.Indoor mini cameras the motion activity spots don't always work. Sometimes it will go off when there is motion in the grayed out zones, and sometimes not go off in the non-greyed out zones. This maybe human error on our part.

I use the Blink system and have 4 cameras outside for security and know they are reliable.  That said the Doorbell is just excellent.  The doorbell is fairly close to the blink module inside the house which may result in improved reliability compared to the reviews I read.  The image quality is exceptional (you can change it from low to high, I have it set on high).  The detection is also incredible, always lets me know when there is someone there at the door.

The doorbell is anything but reliable. Press the bell, and the doorbell may or may not ring on my phone. But that’s just one problem.Since I bought the doorbell, I purchased two mini (indoor) cameras and two outdoor cameras. I’ve been notified that in order for these cameras to record, I have to buy more storage, and for all of the cameras to record, it will cost me $100 yearly.So when I buy a camera, I fully expect that I own the camera and therefore, should NOT have to pay additional fees to have these cameras record… especially when I have NO need to store the videos off line.So bottom line…. Don’t waste your money. You’re not going to own the cameras unless you’re happy having security cameras that won’t record unless you pay additional fees. I STRONGLY recommend you look at others systems. The cameras are not very expensive, but without the ability to record, they’re completely useless to me. Am I unhappy with blink…. YOU BET I AM.

246,Paul Davis,Very sadly disappointed,"  I was an early adopter of the Blink camera system. I own several, and have recommended Blink to many, many people. Sadly, this new doorbell missed the mark - the mounting system is a design failure. I attempted to mount and and dismount the camera from the backplate prior to drilling holes in my steel siding. Now, I'm very competent, and confident with DIY projects, however, even after watching the instructional video and reading numerous reviews, I truly struggled with this design. I eventually managed to get the camera mounted to the backplate, but even with the supplied tool, removal was simply too cumbersome. Sadly, I'm returning this even before trying out the actual performance of the product. After all, how am I supposed to eventually change the batteries when it's mounted to the house when I can't easially open it on my kitchen counter? Sorry Blink.

247,Erushka,Overall ok,"  Overall, it's an ok product.  It took several days to adjust the camera settings and activity zones to avoid getting car traffic alerts.  This did involve dialing back the camera sensitivity which may be the reason for the inconsistent results we are having with motion detection.  There is still a degree of confusion about the motion detection - some say that it detects motion even with the overall system is disarmed (we already have Blink cameras operational).  Others say it only detects motion when the system is armed or someone rings the bell.  The camera does turn on when the bell is rung - that is consistent and the sound quality of the chime and the microphone/speaker is good.  We have two instances of motion detection when the system is off, so I'm guessing the first claim is true, but it is really inconsistent.  Since we have the other cameras (that are very reliable) it's not critical for our purposes (doorbell with camera).  However, it would be nice to know if, perhaps, we have a malfunctioning unit.  We did not experience any difficulties with mounting the unit to the house as some have stated.  It is a snug fit, but the instructions are very clear and it was up in one try.

I kinda shrugged that off at the time, but WOW!  What a pain in the backside to install.Other than that, the camera appears to work very nicely.  I have it in wireless mode until next summer when it's warm enough to fiddle with small wires in the frozen northland.  It makes an annoyingly-loud chime sound that I can't seem to figure out how to adjust, but I can live with that because I won't be hearing it, the person pressing the button will :)I'm a bit skeptical about battery life (in Minnesota we can regularly have a week or two of below-zero F temperatures, and much of the winter is at 30-degrees F or colder), but I guess we'll see.

250,as4ronin,It’s just okay,"  The doorbell doesn’t always ring/synch well with my Alexa devices. Hence I sometimes miss when someone rings. My main issue is with the app. It takes too long when trying to view live when someone is actually at the door, if it even works. Often it just keeps spinning but never lets me view who’s at my door for so long that eventually they leave or ring the doorbell again. Then if you do go to click on the camera again it tells you “live view in progress please wait”. It takes so long that the person just leaves. I think the camera works okay enough but the app kinda sucks.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2022"
251,Drift in Progress,Go with your gut,"  I was nervous to buy this device because of the negative reviews regarding mounting. However I’m glad I bit the bullet and did it. I had a Ring 2 doorbell however without the Ring alarm system and already having Blink cameras to watch my dog, I wanted to consolidate my apps for security. So I got the blink doorbell and I had no issues mounting — unless I did it incorrectly? The app walked me through all of the instructions in order to get it set up and installed on my house. And because I live in a duplex the wide angle was a nice surprise. It gives me the right view so I can see someone coming up our stairs without invading my neighbor’s privacy. It also gives me a good view of the front door even though it’s not mounted right next to it .I haven’t quite figured out if the connection with Alexa is as seamless as the Ring was. But I think I’m handy enough to make things work.You really can’t beat the price. And now I’m able to give my Ring to someone who just wants to watch their doorstep.Curious to see how long the batteries last. I think it said over a year. For me that’s nice because I hated having to charge the ring battery. Even though I had it hard wired, the cold weather would eventually deplete the battery. I find it much easier to just pop in AA batteries.Overall I think none of these doorbells have it all. You’ve just got to find what works for you. Between my simplsafe alarm system and smart lock and my Blink indoor cameras that are so affordable, and now the added security being able to see my front doorstep, I’m a happy camper.So far the only complaint I have is that I can’t set the doorbell to have motion alerts unless my system is armed. I kind of want to get motion alerts even when I’m home during the day but I don’t necessarily want to arm my system because I have other cameras in the house that I’ll trigger while I’m home. I don’t want to turn off motion announcements on those other cameras because I want to watch my dog while I’m gone.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2021"

No complaints and at $34 how can you go wrong. Easy to add to Alexa and my current blink app.Update, I bought a 2nd unit and about a week of use I get the battery should be replaced. I put a new pair of lithium AA batteries then after another week I get the same message. 6 batteries in 2 weeks is a problem. Contacted tech support and after 24 hrs they responded but already requested return. Rec’d several emails trying to troubleshoot even after informing them of the return and for a different problem and not the battery issue I reported.

253,Kasey,Works with Alexa but not quite,"  What is good. The video on this camera is extremely clear and sharp. Motion detection is very good. The doorbell chime is pleasant. I wired in place of existing doorbell, and it rings the original doorbell in the house. I added a routine to Alexa to announce on select Echo devices when the doorbell is pressed, perhaps redundant since the bell rings. The Blink app on my phone allows two-way conversation with visitors. I can open the camera view on my Echo Show with verbal command and after a bit I am looking outside.What is bad. Attaching the camera body to the wall-attached panel was extremely difficult. I wanted the Routine to automatically open the camera view on my Echo Show. I talked with Amazon support and we determined the Blink camera is an UNSUPPORTED device for the Alexa app to manage the Camera in a Routine. Only Ring can do this.Really?

I replace a wired doorbell with the Blink doorbell. The physical install is 2 screws for mounting and an additional 2 screws to connect the existing doorbell wires which is optional.  The setup is ridiculously easy on the Blink app.  All together installation was about 15 minutes, most of which was reading the instructions.The picture quality is excellent.  Motion detection is the same as the cameras and night vision on my front porch is excellent.

I’ve lost respect for Amazon. We may be switching our entire house over to either Apple or Google products I’m starting to do research now on quality of those vs Amazon.  Where to begin, the setup is a nightmare correct Wi-Fi password used over 10 times it took to connect to the blink servers.  By the time it actually started to work it was dark the night time quality looks like it’s 20 years old.  After any settings are changed a doorbell press is needed over 30 presses later nothing registers any of the button presses to start the changes in settings.  It doesn’t register motion detection it doesn’t work with the echo show it doesn’t work as intended as a doorbell.  I have 20 years of experience building computers and working with different software languages.  This is not a lack of IT knowledge this is a subpar product from $1 billion company and they should be ashamed of themselves for even selling it.

I have an echo show and an echo dot in another room and I am able to hear when the doorbell is being rung simply through the Echo devices! It’s super convenient to see who’s at the door on the echo show as well! The picture and sound quality on this doorbell is sooo great. They also let me know they are working on bringing on a chime as well, which is amazing! Thank you blink :)Preordered this device since everyone had something negative to say about the ring but at this point that must’ve been the better option. I won’t be able to know if my doorbell has been rung unless my phone is on loud and on??? Where is the chime? Something to plug into wall to hear it from another room? It’s inconvenient, plus it takes a while from the click of the doorbell to actually get a notification on my phone. Not liking it so far.

257,Sue D.,Must pay for subscription for recording-not working properly,"  The only thing I have good to say is that I like that you can wire it and it will ring the wired doorbell as well and notify you on app and works with Alexa. However it does not work about half of the time. Typically it has to be pressed two times to actually activate the doorbell & notifications. When I contacted customer service they provided a YouTube link on how to install. That was not helpful, it was installed correctly. I purchased 60 days ago and they refused to allow a return, only a replacement. Also after the free 1 month subscription to the app, you must pay to have any recordings or install additional equipment. You will still get a notification, and can view ""live"" but cannot see any recordings. Wish I would have looked more closely at other reviews/questions so I knew this. I would not have purchased. Also the app is not great. I have seen much better options out there. I would not recommend this product.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2022"

Unfortunately it is not straightforward to connect the sync module. I could not get it to work so I called blink tech support. Tech support walked me through the process. First you have to delete the doorbell camera and then add in the sync. Once the sync is connected, then you add back in the doorbell camera. You also have to delete the app and then reinstall it. But finally it worked!  Night vision could be better, it’s a little muddy. Daytime is very good. Can’t beat this setup for the price. I preordered it and paid around $50.  Ever since then it has been selling for around $34.My biggest complaint is that once you get notification of movement, the moving object is already gone.

Two problems with the doorbell/storage so far. 1) There is a moderately busy road about 100 feet and downhill from my front door. It catches the edge of my screen so I blocked it with the privacy block to inactivate this part. It did not work. My notifications went off about 20 times in 2 hours. I tried adjusting the location of the doorbell. I finally removed the doorbell from outside. I could not find a place it worked. 2) I bought the 256 USB drive and tried to be very careful about not using the cloud. I got a notification my cloud service was interrupted. I do not know where the information is going. Positive note: I had one person ring the doorbell. I easily heard it inside my home. I was towards the front door. I do not know what it will be like in the back of the house. If there is a non-wired chime that could be place inside the home centrally that would be good. If I don’t have the phone on me, and I am not in the front of the house, I might not hear the person at the door.Camera: I have not installed them. It takes two people, one to hold the camera and the other to look at the phone to see where it is best to install it. There is a delay between live view/camera and when you see it on the phone. The camera can easily come off the adjustable mounting bracket, so I do not want someone stealing the camera. I am trying to find a high enough place to make it difficult to steal, but still give the coverage I need.

260,Thomas Fosson,"Oops, video no longer available.","  First, the system actually works pretty good. Daylight video and pictures are sharp...night time not so much. But what frosts my ---- is the loss of my ability to record video unless I subscribe to Amazons cloud. No where in the original ad (the first page where all the info on a product is normally listed) does it mention this. In fact, I was looking long and hard for this kind of system because they pointed out you could install your own thumb drive for recording video on a local drive. If you scroll down about 3 (4?) pages they actually break it down and show you how little the system will do after the original 30 day free trial. I don't use the cloud and the reason I never bought other systems is because I did not want to pay a monthly fee to have clips saved to the cloud.

261,Thomas Fosson,Price offset by cloud storage,"  This setup is quite affordable, especially during the holiday season—it’s definitely a loss leader in the Amazon world, like many other Amazon products.  However, the fail point of the affordability is that the device’s primary perks (motion detection and recording) become worthless if you don’t purchase the cloud plan.  I misunderstood the advertising to believe that if I bought the hub I wouldn’t have this problem, but that is not the case.  I have two blink cameras in my house so a cloud subscription is around $10/month—a price that can hinge on whether or not I can budget out a night in a medium quality restaurant once a month and still pay all my bills.  If I were purchasing a security camera in the future, I would most definitely do more research and ensure that the product I purchase doesn’t require a plan that costs me over a hundred dollars a year.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2022"

It picks up sound, motion etc. and is very clear. What I don’t like about it is I can’t get it to have a live view. ONLY when it detects motion or someone rings the bell does it have a live view. I wanted to be able to open the app and look at my lot even if no one was there. But it  doesn’t allow that. Or like I said perhaps i don’t understand the app fully. I have gone through the app meticulously and can’t see where I have that option. Also, if someone rings your bell and you tap the notification and close the app you can’t go back in for a live view.  Idk. For the price it’s good. But I’m going to try ring.Update: returning it because, No. the notifications stopped coming through. I’m not sure how to get them back. Even if you press the button notifications don’t come through. So I opened the app and pressed it then I got a notification. It appears you have to be on the app to get a notification.

268,Ava,Does a few things really well; but is attrocious at others.,"  Previously, I was using a video doorbell from a different company. It did well, but was damaged and I started shopping for alternate units. I came across this item and read reviews, observed functions, etc.. and was fairly excited. The Blink Doorbell had integration with Alexa, which caught my eye. I own an Echo Show 8, my previous doorbell did not work with Alexa. This was my main purchase point. I was sorely mistaken.The doorbell itself isn't flimsy or about to fall apart, but you can tell it's cheaply made with cheaper materials than other products. Connecting the front of the bell to the backplate is damn near impossible... it literally took me 15 minutes to attach it, you have to put so much force on it from multiple directions that one would wonder if it would break beforehand. The issue is the mechanism that holds the backplate on, not the greatest engineering.THERE IS NO SEPARATE CHIME OR RINGER ON THE ENTIRE PLANET COMPATIBLE WITH THIS DOORBELLI mean... seriously? Isn't that sort of the whole point? The only was to get notifications that someone is ringing the bell is through push messages on your Alexa device or mobile device. Even then, they're subtle, AND THEY ONLY WORK IF YOU SUBSCRIBE TO THE ENHANCED FEATURES. Without a subscription, you can get alerts that the bell is pushed or detecting motion, but it's simply a blurry picture as far as video goes and it's not live. You would think the camera view would pop up on the Echo Show when the button was pushed, but it doesn't. It's also not saved anywhere at all; the Sync Module that is supposed to record locally will not save notification pictures or video, and if you use the sync model to record locally (recording what I have no idea) it disables all of the motion alerts from the doorbell. Because you have to pay more for those, right?  Even with the subscription, it simply records a small video clip or notifies you so you can live-view the camera to see who it is. Without the subscription... you can quickly live view video and get a notification on your phone when someone pushes the button.This is hands-down the most terrible engineering and sales model I have ever seen. It's along the lines of buying a cell phone and then having to pay to use it. The only difference is that the cell phone companies tell you this way ahead of time, very clearly, and it serves a purpose. Such a major disappointment. This is the only time in my twelve years of being a loyal Amazon customer I have *EVER* been upset with Amazon for making a product that behaves like this. Somehow...

It lags and often does not detect pedestrian movement, but seems to pick up vehicles well, which I don't want.  When and if a person is detected during daylight hours, the video captures them walking away for a fraction of a second. With vehicles, I am constantly getting notifications even though I have the camera set to exclude movement coming from the street. That function is definitely not working as it captures every car travelling down the block. The quality of the video is good during daylight hours or when an area is lit during darkness. Night vision is pretty much worthless as it might show you a shadow or shape of whatever is passing by.

277,Philip,Just Ok,"  Dislike:Most say the mounting is difficult, I find it incredibly easy and even easier to remove. I can pop it on and off easily which means it could get stolen.The camera angle is bad. I used to just use an outdoor camera mounted above my door, which sees everything including faces, where packages are left, etc, and is out of reach from thieves. This doorbell camera doesn’t see the ground in front of the door, you just get waist up and lots of sky. Basically - blind spots everywhere. I’m guessing this is typical of any doorbell camera so less of a knock in blink and just a realization these things are a waste of money without serious mounting modifications.It’s a fairly large doorbell, and if you need a wedge or modification to mount it, it protrudes out a lot.Doesn’t seem very weather resistant. Lots of gaps, doesn’t sit flush or tight. Not a problem for me since I have a large covering but for some this could pose an issue.Like:You can connect it to your doorbell, which worked out well enough.Easy to set up and mount, took all of 15 min.Price… for just the doorbell it’s less than half most other options, so I won’t feel too bad when it aggravates me enough that I ditch it.Summary I’ll use it for a while and see how it goes but a security camera above the door plus a regular doorbell is a much better set up.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2021"
278,Philip,Surprised battery is still good,"  I was expecting the battery to die out already but it's still going strong. Bought this because the other products require physical wiring for power and battery sounded very ncie if it really can last long. Install was very easy and it's been capturing motion in the areas I need it to. It's been running since November and been capturing videos into the Sync module 2. The only thing I do have a problem with and reason to remove a star is when videos are sent to the sync module, there are no thumbnails like it does for cloud storage. It would be very easy to have the sync module create thumbnails even in a delayed manner for the videos since it's connected to wire for power and don't have to worry about battery usage. As an Amazon company, you should be more customer focus and not try to limit features to have people buy the cloud plan.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2022"
279,Cali Love,Works great BUT,"  Works great BUT the only 2 gripe I have1: Is the ""limit the Field of view"" doesn't work to help you limit what the camera picks up when you have the ""Motion camera"" Enabled, I know that is a BETA feature but I have used it on the stand alone camera's for a VERY long time and would be nice to have working. With out this feature working the camera picks up vehicles going up and down the road or even Horses across the road about 60' away and will really eat up the Batteries quickly.2: To have a real inside doorbell sound inside without having a wired Doorbell you need to buy the ""CHIME"" I think or have your phones volume turned up and with you but if your not home and others are they just hear the Alexa say your message, My Alexa merely tells me someone is at the front door and doesn't really ring.B Mills",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2021"

Biggest complaint is any kind of settings change requires you to immediately go ring the doorbell for settings to take affect. This is ineffective if you were away from the location I need to increase your sensitivity levels or other settings. Please know that you will have to purchase a month plan through the Blink company or you will not be able to view any of the security footage once your trial period runs out.

I initially installed Blink cameras around my home, but had to add a Ring doorbell for the front door entry area.  I don’t know why it took Blink so long to develop the doorbell.Anyways, it’s finally here and it works fine!  I no longer have to rely on a two-vendor solution. ( It was a hassle having to maintain a Blink and Ring solution.)The doorbell integrates seamlessly with the rest of the Blink products.  It was very easy to add and install.  As others have mentioned, the only challenge was slipping back on the top cover (needs to be pressed on and slid down).The video quality is great and the ring is loud.  I have no complaints.  It’s no different from the rest of my Blink cameras, and can be just as easily monitored on my iPhone and computers.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2021"
282,Thomas L. 3,Just installed,"  Ok, so I finally got time to install my Blink Door bell.  Installation was pretty straight forward, you should play with installing the doorbell onto the mount a little before actually installing it, they make it tight and hard for a reason.  After installing it with the flat mount I decided I would be better served using the included wedge mount.  One problem, there are no screws included to mount the flat mount to the wedge mount, only screws for the plastic anchors to mount the unit to the wall.  I will contact customer service and no doubt they will take care of me as Amazon always has.I am still playing with and learning settings, but initially the audio has an echo/reverb/repeat something fierce, I am guessing this can be dealt with in setting, I just need to play with them enough to figure it out.I went with the wired set up to connect to my existing doorbell.  Only issue that bothers me at this moment is I need to kill the chime on the Blink door bell so it does not ring along with the inside chime.  Its a personal preference, but I have never rang a door bell that you couldn't hear from the door, no reason to hear two different chimes at once it is kind of annoying.Now I just installed this thing, so this is an initial review, and I am still figuring out features in the app.  I will give additional reviews the longer I have it.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2021"

Right out of the box you can see how cheaply made the camera is. Includes nothing to assist with the install. Ring came with everything you needed from the blocks to the drill bit to install in brick. Any accessories you need must be ordered separately. It did come with screws to use in wood. Also if you thing you are doing away with batteries by hard wiring it, wrong!!! The wiring only powers the bell not the camera. Ring come with 2 rechargeable batteries so you can swap them out.

284,CharisFleming,I wish I bought something else.,"  You would think that a doorbell of all things would come with a wireless chime, or there would be at least an easy aftermarket accessory. I don't have a wired bell, and the only way I can get a response inside, which is hit or miss, is to set up an a Alexa skill. You'd think that since this in an Amazon device, they'd have a way to view the camera on a FireTV device. You can't really use this bell without a monitoring station, and unless you add a flash drive, the only way you can save your cam info is do sign up for a monthly service.This fails as a doorbell, is cumbersome to set up, and doesn't truly integrate the way I'd expect from Amazon. Pity as I own 4 fire tv sticks, the Amazon DVR, two Tablets and Eero.

Great quality of video and pictures. Only issue I had was that I wasn't getting notifications from the app and support wasn't helpful, kept trying to get me to return the device even tho I kept telling them that the bell/camera works fine, it was the app that wasn't sending push notifications. Eventually I figured out to just clear out the cache from the app and that did the trick. I did not get a Sync as this is the only Blink device I have but I may invest in another Blink camera with Sync for my back entrance/porch area. I'm still in the trial period for the subscription service and I'll probably subscribe once that's over since it's so cheap ($30/yr for Basic).

Once you scan the qr code everything syncs to your account. Name the camera, pick its location.... smooth setup. It can either be battery powered or hard wired to an existing doorbell. We preferred the battery option so we'd get the optimal placement for it. This being our first video doorbell I have nothing to compare it to. Honestly never thought of purchasing one until this was offered. We have no issues. Only thing I'd ask is would it be possible in a update to add a few new chimes. Our previous battery powered doorbell and receiver speaker's bells were more harmonious vs blink's sounding winey. Maybe it's in the settings...

287,FrankJ,Great start but not as advertised,"  I have been a long term Blink customer (prior to Amazon ownership) and overall I've been happy with the family of products. Affordable, does the job, and no additional services required. I've long awaited the door bell. Installation was relatively straightforward; just follow the online installation instructions. The one MAJOR disappointment I have is the fact that the unit DOES NOT work with IFTTT. (I challenge anyone to show me how to get the camera from the doorbell to show up in the motion detect trigger within the free IFTTT app.) Blink tech support was no help. They said ""it should work"" but made not recommendations beyond what I had already done (e.g. remove the blink activation from IFTTT, sign out, etc, etc). This was a huge disappointment because I was going to leverage IFTTT on the camera trigger to activate my IFTTT enabled ""door bell chime"". Based on the fact that the product doesn't work with IFTTT I gave it two stars; fix this problem and I'd adjust the review to 4 stars.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2021"

I get the notification that someone is at the front door, and by the time the video loads, the person has come and gone.  I've only had one person use the door bell.  That worked okay too. I'm going to have to fine tune the aiming of the doorbell camera, as I cannot see the face of the person whom is at the door.  I have three additional cameras, and  yet to install the third one.  One of the cameras I have outside, I placed in a poor spot...right above the dryer vent! Duh!  It has picked up the neighbors pets that roam the neighborhood, but it also has been fogged up by rain, snow and of course, dryer steam.

Asked for a replacement which is not done. Asked to replace JUST the doorbell. Couldn’t do that either. Since my doorbell and Sync 2 module were purchased as a set, I had to return both. The doorbell was already mounted as were 1-2 cameras. We had to remove them all. The cameras are worthless without the doorbell and the sync 2 module. It was all very frustrating. To top this all off, I bought the doorbell and sync set during Black Friday sales at a really good price. If I were to replace the set, I would have to pay the difference, an additional $35.

There is one thing I have noticed that could use a bit of improvement and that would be the coverage is a bit less than I would like on one side.  I don't know why since it's aimed straight ahead but it definitely favors on side over the other.  But that's fine if they get in the sight closer up it sees that and sends a notification.  The speaking part works very well and notifications can be picked up when away from home.  Now whether that means it reaches my phone or it's feeding off of my ipad and then sending to my phone I can't tell you.  But it's nice to know what's going on while away.

291,J Mama,"Too good to be true... Please! read the review other then ""5 stars"" before buying.","  This is my review, it may sound biased or even hatred to it but I purchase this Blink doorbell with Sync Module 2 on sale on Nov 29, 2021, for $65 + $15 USB flash drive. I won't recommend buying at full price unless you are the type of person who is the monthly subscription user and by all means. It is a great device with a subscription.Without the subscription, it kinda sucks... I live in an apartment complex and needed some kind of camera to record the delivery of my packages. Since packages get stolen is very common in my area or any apartments in general. This is my opinion but I also hate subscription fees... There are way too many subscriptions now these days but the Blink doorbell was a cheaper option vs the rest of the doorbells on the market.The truth is that once your free 1-month trial period is over. The doorbell turns into a security camera...  The only function it has left is to record the motion detection onto the flash drive connecting to Sync Module 2. The ability for me to view my video footage without paying extra, it sold me into buying it. My biggest complaint is that it ONLY record motion detection footage without subscriptions! You are no longer able to record ANY footage from someone walking up to you're door and pressing the physical button. My second complaint is that it uses an expensive battery and has no ability to use a rechargeable battery?? C'mon now it's 2022..This doorbell gets 3 stars and that me being generous... Because in one whole month, I have to unplug and replug the ""Sync Module 2"" too many times. It randomly stops recording footage into the flash drive even though I get a notification of ""Motion detected at your front door""? What other feature is left if this doesn't even work properly for a non-subscription user? Amazon please work on your Sync Module 2... It need some kind of feature like button on the app for a ""reset"".

Also setup your your ZONE so that way, the camera doesn't record all the time and kill your battery prematurely.3. Enable Alexa integration to allow notification charm on echo devices besides your phones.A couple of features and enhancements to make it better:• SD or Micro SD instead of USB Flash drive will save some space.• Builtin Charm on the Sync Module will definitely help those who have family members that may not have access to the app or may not want to link to Alexa and echo devices.

The price seems right but it did not include a corner or wedge mount -- that will cost you an additional 13 dollars or 8 if you get it on sale. Given that the corner or wedge are essential parts for doorbells that are to the side of the door, I thought this was an oversight by blink to include it since for pennies for the dollar they could have included these parts. The video quality is good during the day it has a bit of trouble dealing with the front when the sun is out.

The ONLY problem is the mount---I watched the video, followed the directions and tried my best to get it to work with my vinyl siding--no problem connecting the back piece to the siding but I couldn't get the camera/doorbell part to connect to the backpiece.  The only way I could finally use it was to connect the back piece to the unit before mounting, and then use heavy duty double sided mounting tape to connect it to my outer glass door frame. It works, but heaven knows if I'll be able to take it apart when I need to replace the batteries!

This is odd considering Blink’s devices are mainly used for live video surveillance and motion detection. So you’ll have to wait until someone presses the doorbell button (if you don’t get their membership) to detect movement. You could set up the armed mode, but then you’ll be dealing with unwanted notifications if your door bell aims a busy street.SET UP:Set up wasn't hard, and I used command strips to test the device before mounting, but I can see what others refer to when they say it’s hard to mount. The plastic part that you use to drill the device to the wall doesn’t line up well with the device’s prongs to attach, so I had to force it in fearing it would crack and break.In the end I’m returning this because I rather pay a little more for a device I’ll definitely use, won’t have to just settle for, and have to wait til the company releases basic features that other devices already have.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2021"

If you are not tied into the Blink ecosystem, buying the sync module adds up and dosent keep this door bell price effective.In addition, I like that one can opt out of the monthly subscription and store all the videos locally on the Blink sync module.

310,Iniysa,You get what you pay for,"  Worked well for the one free month of subscription - live view came up fairly quick and saved video access was fast.But after that even basic live view stopped loading. For weeks it would either not work or take forever to upload live view. Of course, same internet connection, same product settings & everything else. Then last week it started loading but today, not in the mood! And dont forget, all this “nothing” after pairing it with a $35 hub.Yes it rings the original home chime but needs battery to function. Slick marketing! Made me think connection to existing wiring also powered this doorbell. Now the battery life is literally only handfull weeks if you arm the system for motion recognition.Overall cheap product gives you cheap functions!

But it still works with batteries without the back plate being attached. The back plate is mainly used for mounting and holding batteries in place. The batteries really dont need back plate. Only for wall mounting purposes.Just a warning the device left like its outside can be easily dismounted or takened apart from its base. If someone wanted to take it they could.

312,Nathan R Z,Great Addition to Existing Blink System,  I have been supplementing my wired security camera system with Blink XT2 cameras in locations where running wires to the necessary location would have been inconvenient. Been working well for past year or so. This doorbell addition now allows me now to view the faces and not only the tops of the heads of individuals coming up my stairway where a Blink camera is positioned higher out of arms reach.Works much better than anticipated in terms of recognition of motion and recording of images. Note that camera doesn't do well pointed into sunlight as images tend to get washed out if you've got a bright backlight behind the subject but overall cannot complain about this product.

313,J. H.,Slow response time when not using the cloud but the Sync Module 2. Not very useful.,"  I'm using it to replace an existing doorbell with 24Vac power supply. The installation is quite streight forward, and the wedge mount is very good for those situation where you need to put the camera with a certain angle. After the installing the hardware, following the step by step App instruction is not a problem, but if you have a Sync Module 2, it may be tricky to notice that both system must be under the same group (The interface/instructions could be improved). The real issue is the response time, if you have a cloud subscription the App will show images and video pretty fast, if you only plan to use the Sync Module 2 , sometime it takes more than 20-30 seconds to show a live image, meaning it's too late to see somebody at the front door.Is it meant to be like that to promote the cloud subscription?During my tests I also noticed that the motion detection is often sending a notification with a picture showing nobody, meaning I had the time to walk at the front door and away without been captured by the camera.The 2 way audio quality is very good.So far it is not meeting my expectations.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2022"

What a crock. Unless I stare at my phone 24/7 I will never know someone is at the door. Even when all of the apps are installed and connected it takes way too long to connect to be useful. You want to answer the doorbell in real time, not wait for it to synch up every time.  Even the motion detection is not useful because the filter grid does not work. I bought an Echo just to act as a wireless chime because Blink does not make one. It is basically useless. Spend more money and get a working product. Blink, don't release junk before it is tested.

They determined the doorbell I received was defective & they sent a replacement. Replacement has been working well for almost 2 weeks now. I’ve updated the rating based on the great service and getting a replacement. ***I bought this to replace my Ring that stopped working after many years. Product looks pretty but functionality is lacking tremendously. My feedback:1) Needs AA batteries even when wired. Batteries barely last a week.2) Video quality is poor unless you set IR sensitivity to medium or high. However, this drains your AA batteries significantly.4) door bell chime does not work once battery drains5) with battery draining this fast, if you are away from home for more than a few days, you can be assured you won’t have video recording (sync module needs to be purchased separately, fyi).",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2022"
316,Vette06,The ABSOLUTE worse setup instructions ever created. Awful tech support.,"  I was very hopeful in buying this ""smart"" doorbell. Tried to set it up and had no luck getting it to work. Just had a flashing blue light on the doorbell button but nothing else. The instructions are almost non-existent. I called tech support and after going through several automated steps, I was put on hold for the next available agent. After about 5 minutes, an automated response comes back to tell me they would have to call me back. Alright. This could wait until morning.  Well guess what? Morning came and went, as did the afternoon, as did the evening and no phone call. I finally got it to pair with the sync module only to discover that the lag time in the live view is pitiful. By the time you open the app and look to see who rang the bell, they are gone. The next day, I returned it for a refund. But wait! There's more. Five days later, tech support finally calls me. I chuckled and told them it was too late. I had returned the item. So to sum it up, if you think you might be one of the lucky ones that gets it to work out of the box, relying not on the lame setup instructions that comes in the box but on a few YouTube videos...

Complaints about the motion is being detected every time a car passes or person passes on the road are probably not tweaking the their active/inactive zones.2-way mic/speaker is good but not perfect.

321,Amazon Customer,Waste of Money,"  I really do not want to degrade the product, therefore, I will say it was a poor investment for me.I purchased the Doorbell and two Outdoor Cameras, and here are my concerns.1.  By the time the camera senses the motion and start recording, the subject has ""Come and Gone"".  The closest I have seen someone approaching my house (front) is their back entering the porch area.  The Amazon delivery people are so fast, I get a glimsp when they ring the doorbell and the front camera does not pick them up ""Coming or Going"". The second camera is on the Patio (see #2).2.  On the few (very few) ocassions that I have been able to see a subject (all three cameras) I was not able to identify who they were because they were blacked out due to back light.I went online to the support site and it indicated the delay on recording wass due to weak wify signal, so I attempted to measure signal strength with two phones and a laptop at each camera location. (my neighbors had to think I was crazy on a ladder with a laptop)  The signal strength was good on each of this devicees. I removed the cameras and checked signal strengthon each staanding in front of the router.  I switch to the ATT modem and each time the camera indicate weak signal (2 bars).  I cannot say definitively that it is the camera but I am suspect.  BTW, is there anyway to switch wifi connections without deleting the camera?  The sync module seems to be fine, but it is sitting next to the router.I missed the return deadline due to illness but I am asking them to replace the camera, maybe, I will get lucky.

It will still capture if the doorbell rings, but I miss it functioning like a camera and just showing motion detection. The 'arm' schedule is very difficult to set up in the app - it's all or nothing - so it's a lot of manually turning the camera on. I'm on the fence and may return or sell, and go back to my Nest.Update: I got a second sync module and am now able to arm only the blink camera and leave the rest of my cameras unarmed.

First off my existing doorbell transformer supply power is 11VAC which is below the required 16VAC minimum required. Works just fine on 11VAC. 2nd, the base plate seemed to not want to snap into place when mounted flush against the door jamb. I ended up using two small pieces of 1/4"" plastic tubing cut to about an 1/8"" as a stand off. Once the base plate was just off the surface it seemed to snap into place very easy. Overall the installation was a breeze with the only pain being with the Alexa integration. My only issue is with video capture response time as you could drag the couch out of my house before the capture starts .  Still haven't been able to get Alexa to make any announcements.

330,markynofunkybunch,Frustrating to install/use,"  I replaced a nest doorbell that had quit working with this doorbell.  I’m relatively comfortable installing.  I’ve installed several nest thermostats and a nest doorbell with no issues.  This is difficult to install.  The screw spacing on the back bracket does not line up with the nest doorbell (which lined up exactly with my previous doorbell).  You’ll potentially need a drill to create new holes for this doorbell in order to install.  This was an annoying inconvenience.  Once the bracket is wired in (optional) and screwed in place, clipping the doorbell onto the bracket is very difficult.  You need to connect the doorbell to the bracket (completely install it) before you can flip the breaker to see if it works.  Mine did not so I had to take the whole thing apart to reinstall.  Frustrating but now I’m experienced at clipping the doorbell onto the bracket which was difficult.Once installed, I expected the interface to work more seamlessly with Alexa since it’s an Amazon product. It was no different than nest…. in fact, it was more steps/more complex.If I had it to do over again, I would purchase the nest over this device.  The sync module with local storage is what made me choose this over the nest and while that is a nice feature, it’s not worth the hassle of the setup and interface of this device.I",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2021"

337,TN,It's good but...,"  The doorbell works fine and sounds pretty. If you have multiple Amazon echo devices I would suggest to make the notifications sound only on one or as few as possible to avoid the difference in response time from each device creating an echo all throughout your house (no pun intended). I'm not sure if it's an issue on my end but I am unable to view a live feed from either the blink app or the echo app. The echo app, the Amazon one, is supposed to allow me to view a live feed but the loading button just keeps going in circles so I'm assuming it has something to do with my connection but I don't want to dismiss it right away as that. But that is still no excuse for the blink app lacking a live feed feature. I don't think it's out of the realm of merit to be able to see a live feed through the blink doorbell camera without having anybody press the doorbell. So in conclusion it's a nice looking doorbell and it'll send you notifications to your phone where you can see the person at your front step, about 2 to 3 seconds lag time, but I wish I can pull up a live feed on my mobile device at will without anybody having to ring the doorbell.

Not believing that could be the case I contacted Blink customer service with the question ""is the Echo Gen 4 supported?""  They instead referred me to the supported list which lists the Echo Gen 1 and Gen 2 but did not mention my Gen 4.  To complicate things the list included support for the Echo Studio Gen 2 and Gen 3 but not the Gen 1 which to my understanding is the only one that exists.  Customer service was polite but unhelpful.  Just a yes or no and I would have been satisfied.  Searching reviews I found a few who said they were unable to pair with the Echo Gen 4.  I have not seen 1 review where the Echo Gen 4 was successfully paired.  I have an older Echo Dot that I replaced with the Echo Gen 4 and the Dot connected perfectly.I'll gladly change my rating if I can pair my Echo Gen 4 to the Blink doorbell but I don't understand why customer service won't say whether they are compatible.

339,Customer01,Disappointing,"  I have two outdoor Blink cameras that have worked well, but I cannot say the same for this doorbell. It's very slow to connect and often requires a couple of attempts before it will connect. This makes seeing who is at the door difficult. The daytime image is good, but the night image is poor. This may be due to where it is mounted as my front door is recessed several inches and immediately to the doorbells left is the end of a brick. It appears the Infrared light is reflected off the brick bright enough to wash out the image limiting it's usefulness.  As I had to drill holes in my aluminum door trim to mount the doorbell I'm not inclined to find another mounting location as the holes in the trim would be difficult to cover and hide. For my use it's only practical as a doorbell.(Additional) after submitting my original review I read quite a few of other reviews. The doorbell is difficult to mount and took several attempts, but it's not impossible. I wasn't aware there was a corner mount that would allow turning the doorbell until seeing it mentioned in other reviews. It as well as a wedge should be included in the package and I have to agree that it's price is high for a piece of plastic. Since half my view is of a nearby brick I'll most likely order one and hope it solves part of the problem. I also agree the photos used are misleading as the button is not lighted, which probably explains why most people tend to just knock on the door.Additional info: The day after I posted my review I was contacted by Blink support who offered to send me the angle mount free of charge. I accepted and received it several days later. I was pleased to see it was white because many people commented that it only came in black. The key to unlock the doorbell is not the easiest to use, but after removing it the mount did not take long to install. The mount definitely corrected the field of view and no longer is half my view blocked by a nearby brick. The mount also improved the night vision to where it is useable. Unrelated to the mount is still the problem that it usually takes several attempts to connect to live view and people do not seem to notice the doorbell button as it is the same color as the rest of the camera and most knock on the door.

340,Night Hunter,"Great product, but takes a little effort to install","  Now that it’s installed, it works great.  Syncs with hub easily and has good video/photos.  Here’s the downside…unless you have an existing doorbell on a flat surface with screws holes in exactly the same place as the blink doorbell, you will have some work to do.  Here’s my story.  I have siding on my house with cinder block behind it.  So, I didn’t want to drill new holes into the cinder block…plus, doing so would have made the screws that came with the doorbell too short.  So, I decided to use the existing screw holes…unfortunately they didn’t line up with the blink doorbell holes.  So, my solution was to drill a new hole through the plastic mount for the doorbell, which worked.  Then came the mounting.  Because my wall isn’t flat, I had to mount it carefully.  Too tight and the mount bends and the doorbell won’t go on.  Too loose and it’s not secure.  I found the sweet spot with some tinkering and all is good now.  While all of this may sound like a negative, I am happy with the product.  I would buy it again.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2021"
341,Missouri Deb,Could use a screw on either side of plate,"  I like it and it seems good quality overall. The mounting of the doorbell to the plate is a real pain, but once I figured it out, it wasn't to bad. I wish there were 4 mounting screws instead of 2. There should be screws on either side of the plate along with the top and bottom. I mounted it and it doesn't sit totally flat against the door trim. The trim is flat. Still, it seems sturdy enough without to much wobble. I turned off the motion detection since I have a Blink camera that covers my porch and don't need traffic setting it off, even though I turned down the sensitivity.I don't think its a bad camera, I think the mount plate could have been beefier or had a screw on either side to really secure it.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2021"
342,Sterling T.,Not ready for prime time… but they are working on it,"  UpdatedI will give customer service credit for proactively reaching out. They did address the issue of limited features when I didn’t have a sync module.  That bumps this up a couple of stars. I look forward to the redesign of the mount.  When I see that addressed I will update this again.  I do wish these were taken care of before launching, but as long as they get corrected in a timely fashion it heads in a positive direction.Hopefully more to come!Hey Amazon, get your act together.  This product is a dud.  I wanted to like it, but it doesn't set up as easily or function as nicely as the other Blink products.I have a sync module set up on my existing system, but not at the same location as this unit and it simply wouldn't let me set it up on that existing system.  I had to set up a new system without a sync module just for this one camera.And without the sync Module the functionality is inadequate.  Not simply reduced functionality, but completely inadequate.The motion detection unreliable and the build is cheap.  I'm sorry, but the way the unit attaches to the mounting plate is downright pathetic.  It is worse than some no-name-cheap-knockoff design kind of product.  The fragile little plastic teeth that this mounts to are literally thinner than a penny and the actual engagement is about 1mm.  The plastic tab that locks it delicate as well.  Even when I got it to all mounted it feels like it is about to pop off.If this was my first experience with a Blink product I would be done with them for life.  As it is I am starting to have doubts about their other products.I was looking forward to this product because I could add a video doorbell to the existing Blink system I have.  I am not paying for both Blink and Ring services.  However, this product is just too clunky and cheap too really be a worthwhile add on.  I wish you had made it as seamless and as sturdy as the other products in the lineup.I know this is supposed to be the more affordable alternative to Ring, but that is not a reason to excuse shoddy/lazy design.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2021"

It is impossible to mount this to the bracket. Tried for two days to figure out why I could not do it. Then,  Wasted 45 minutes with customer support. They finally told me they were sending me a new bracket because the one that came with the camera did not fit it. The only reason I’m allowing this to happen is because I really like the camera. Will let you know what happens with the new bracket. It strikes me as being ridiculous if it is true that the bracket shipped with the camera doesn’t fit the camera.

344,Liyan,Nice addition for security.,"  I have used the blink cameras for security and enjoy the added peace of mind for security.  I was excited to find that the blink doorbell was affordable and had HD, could be hard-wired.  The drawback is unlike the blink cameras you need to subscribe to Amazon's service to cloud storage for the doorbell.  If you don't you need to have USB storage on the hub.  That is OK but drawback is you don't see clip without going through some extra steps.  For me not a hugh deal but for some might not be what you want.  Still this is more affordable and plans are not too expensive.  I love the doorbell and the added convenience of seeing who is at door with being able to talk to them over app on phone.

Worth the money but definitely purchase the sync module as well.This doorbell is a piece of crap! There is a delay between the bell being actually pressed and the notification that someone is at the door. The night vision is terrible. Almost black, even with my LED porch light on. Without the monthly subscription I can't see a thing. It's supposed to have a ""live view"" function at no charge.

346,Richard w.,"Wanted to like it, ended up returning it","  I really tried to like this device, after all it was pretty budget friendly and my expectations weren't too high given the price point. So I was patient with the fact that trying to get to live view via the notification of motion detection rarely worked and never was fast enough to actually seewhat was happening at that moment. I also was patient with the motion detection which was rarely consistent, sometime picking up motion that wasn't there or not detecting motion that was very blatantly apparent. The last straw that broke my patience was when the unit suddenly went offline. I spent about an hour trying to troubleshoot the issue; deleting the doorbell, trying in vain to get it reconnected. After trying to get support, I stumbled upon the information that there was a service disruption. It would have been nice to know prior to me spending all this time trying to troubleshoot something that was out of my control.So I sent an email, because apparently live support isn't something that's available or if it is it's buried somewhere in their support pages. 24 hours turnaround of no information and getting no support seems a bit counter to having a device which is supposed to help with security and monitoring. So that was it for me.No matter how budget friendly, it's just not worth having a product that does such a terrible job at what it's supposed to do and also has terrible customer support for all of the many issues you're sure to run into. So bye Blink, I'm returning you and canceling my subscription (which you need if you want to capture recordings, which you will because you'll never be able to see what's happening live).",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2022"

348,JMichael1106,Camera works great software and Alexa integration OK,"  I have owned Blink cameras since their inception. I have been impressed with their durability and their ability to upgrade their firmware and innovate as wireless WIFI cameras have come of age.. The door bell camera works very well as a motion camera and works well with the smart phone app. But it's function in Alexa has been disappointing. There appears to be no ""live view on notification"" from the doorbell or from the Blink XT cameras (latest generation camera) or at least I have not been able to figure out how to make it work).  RING doorbell cameras do have this function. It does show a live view when I ask Alexa to show one but by the time it loads Blink and shows the live view the event is over (my WIFI is running 500/500 so it's not a slow WIFI).I do have faith that Blink will keep innovating and upgrading the function of their equipment as in the past.

I was excited when I heard blink was releasing their own battery powered doorbell. I’ve been using blink security cameras for a few years now so having a doorbell in the same ecosystem is convenient. My actual doorbell doesn’t face out to the street so having this little battery powered one is perfect and I know The battery will last for months. The only con is that it took me 15 minutes to get the front of the doorbell to click into the base. It’s very difficult and just takes patience,So I’m not looking forward to when the battery needs to be changed. Other than that it works great.

350,Dennis bradley,Look into other cameras,"  It kind of works. If things get better with a Firmware Update, I will update this review.I get constant errors. I attached a few. The camera goes offline a few times a day, but some how comes back. If you keep it Armed it still kind of does it's job and records motion if detected, just doesnt send you a notification. It's not my WiFi going in and out, because my VPN isnt ever affected. Also tried moving the Sync Module on the other side of the wall where the Doorbell is mounted, with no changes.Loading Live View almost never works the first time. You usually have to click it a few times to get it up. Then by then the motion is gone.I havent figured out what motion it will detect and which it wont. Maybe a 3 sensitivity is too low. I have since turned it up, to see if anything changes. I walked the entire view range of the camera and it never set it off. If this doesnt improve it will probably get sent back, because there is no point then.I liked that you could set this up with the On Site Sync Module to store clips. I thought this meant you didnt need a subscription. But have since found out that you still need that if you want any features you would want for a Doorbell camera. If I would have known this I probably would have bought a different one.Edit:After working with tech support nothing has changed. Dont waste your money on this one.

Event Response Mode means that I can’t watch a livestream without a subscription (which is only 3 bucks a month if you only use 1 camera).  I can only access a livestream if I get a notification that someone is there and I press the notification within 60 seconds. Otherwise I just have to look at the recorded video of the event. I’m completely fine with that…as long as it actually works.However most of the time I am pressing the motion notification right away and I’m just greeted with a spinning wheel trying to load the live feed. When that doesn’t work, I close the app and re-open it,  still under 60 seconds, but I can’t view anything live anymore. So most of the time…the live feed feature is useless. Again, I don’t mind that it’s limited to 60 seconds to access it…but it should work consistently as advertised. I think this is why the blink app also has around a 3 star review. The hardware works just fine…I just wish the app was more consistent.

I have changed every single setting and if I adjusted the settings to low sensitivity it picked up the cars but not the fed ex guy standing on my porch dropping off a package but it did pick up his truck driving away.  So I adjust to high sensitivity and I get every car that drives by, person walking, delivery person, and the Sun rising and setting and just generally shining causes it to go off.

Additionally if you are on the phone and someone comes to the door you're out of luck.  A better option would be to just install a dedicated camera and then have a separate doorbell.

We had a Ring doorbell and I was always very frustrated with how long it took the doorbell to react to motion.  This Blink doorbell seems to react much faster.  The video quality is great.  I wish the camera had a slightly wider field of view up and down.  Mounting it to where my old doorbell was mounted, it cuts off the heads of (tall) people as they leave my door. I also have several Blink cameras, so being able to consolidate all my camera devices into one app has been nice.  Setup was simple enough.  There were a lot of complaints about getting the back panel to attach to the doorbell, and I can see how that would be an issue, it does not feel terribly sturdy while attaching it, but I was able to get it to attach and it feels study enough now.  I am not going to give a full 5 stars due to limitations in the software related to being able to add other users to my account, I have to share my account and credentials with anyone who I want to have access to the cameras.  In this case it is my wife and older kids, but I can imagine many use cases where this would be an issue and I think it's a simple thing to fix, but Blink refuses to do anything about it.

There was no previous wiring for a doorbell where I fastened it. It is attached great now and isnt going anywhere! I will say snapping the doorbell onto the mounting plate was a little challenging.

When the system is disarmed, the doorbell acts like a typical doorbell, press the button, phone/tablet rings, get up and answer the door or see and speak to your visitor through the blink app. When the system is armed however, the doorbell isn’t just a doorbell, it’s also a very good camera that records all the activity around my front door !  Just like the outdoor cameras that record my backyard, the indoor cameras that record my pets during the day, the doorbell camera adds another layer of security for my home.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2021"

374,Amazon Customer,Meh,"  The best thing about this is you can set it up so there are no cloud storage charges. Otherwise, reaction time is slow, often times, by the time I'm notified there is (was) someone at the front door, they've left or are headed back to their car. The app is just ok. Biggest fault is there is no way to delete video clips en-mass, instead it's one at a time, swipe, press delete, wait. Swipe, press delete, wait. Repeat that for 15 or 20 clips of wasps, random cars, or people walking their dogs. Yes, you can reduce sensitivity, but them what's the point if there is someone there and you're not notified at all.

A feature that isn't really advertised, you can sync the doorbell into your echo with the ""blink smarthome"" skill and set it to notify on your echo/fire devices.  The video quality is good and for me, it was an easy install.  I knock down one star because the echo integration isn't perfect (the video doesn't immediately show when it's rung.

I can hear the chime for the bell everywhere in the house. Also, the daily camera feed looks like time lapse photography when there is no motion in front of the camera. You'll see the sunrise, movement of the sun across your front yard, sunset, and the night. That daily view is breathtaking.I recommend you purchase the control unit so you can store your video on a USB stick and add upto 9 cameras.

Pretty disappointed in that I've already had to change the battery; my settings were not too absurd for a doorbell camera.  Upon doing so, I learned there is a special plastic key to open the bottom, but it's not really needed; the retaining clip just needs to get pushed in (with a normal key) and you can remove the cover.  Beware, though!  You WILL break one of the 6 pegs that holds the ring doorbell securely to its frame.  Now it is unsecure on the cradle it sits within, and I have had it less than two months and this was my first experience changing the battery.

The picture with this camera is great, and very clear! It has the ability to be watching for motion outside the door (which of course will drain batteries faster). The app is easy to use, though I can't find an access to view the outside camera live without someone physically at my door. Set-up is super easy, and you definitely can't beat the price compared to a Ring camera. Although, there is a subscription; it doesn't effect the camera functionality, it is mainly for storing the captures of video from the camera itself (like cloud storage).

381,Bryan,Just okay. Great for the price however. Installation is definitely tricky on stucco.,"  I do have the same complaint as the others, the back is very flimsy and when you tighten the two screws it bends over the uneven surface making it impossible to place the doorbell and lock it into place. I had to chisel out some stucco to make it as flat as possible for installation while loosening the screws. Also, wiring in the doorbell does nothing but add the original chime in your home. It does not power the unit!!! Which in their verbiage they claim to use battery OR hardwired, which is certainly not the case. Even with all of those issues it's not a bad doorbell for the price!

382,Harvey,"Can’t interact with person at door, setting options poor - disappointed","  The reaction time has a delay from when it starts to what can be seen. It seemed to work well until I connected it to my Alexa account, hoping it would automatically show the door, when motion was detected. THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN.  What the Alexa Show does is announce you have motion. By the time u ask Alexa to “show doorbell” the visitor is gone. This system is honestly useless unless you just want video of motion around your property. Even then it isn’t that great, as the outdoor camera has little response to anything over 14 feet away.  I purchased the doorbell, exterior camera, module 2 and a one year subscription. This system does not serve my purposes.The settings on the doorbell do not record over 30 seconds unless you hit continue (every 30 seconds), then it takes AT LEAST 10 seconds to reset before it will start recording again. This 10 seconds could be the 10 seconds you need if someone is up to no good. You are able to set the cameras to stop recording early if the motion stops, but this does not mean it keeps recording so long as there is motion.  It still will not exceed 30 seconds, without manual intervention. To say I’m disappointed is an understatement considering the outdoor camera was $99.If you just want to record people coming to your door then the price for the doorbell is fine but don’t forget the module.  If you purchase just the doorbell and a subscription, then hook it up directly to your phone, perhaps you will have the speed you need to directly interact. I suggest you do not connect the system to your Alexa account since there does not seem to be a way to disconnect. Just use the blink app and purchase a subscription.

From the time I opened the box until the time the camera was working on the app on my phone, was fewer than 10 minutes. I added an extra camera inside in the garage and setup for that was quick and painless as well.

They sent me a new doorbell and sync module. The installation was flawless and it works great! It is what I expected my experience to be after using the Blink system for about 5 years.Thank you Blink Support Team!OLD REVIEWThis device requires a dedicated 2G network. This means you have to create a separate 2G WIFI network if you have a 5G router. Even if your network detects that it is a 2G device and connects it to the network as a 2G device. The doorbell will not work.My existing Blink cameras work fine with the current network.

I would suggest you get it and try it before you purchase any wedges, see what area you can cover without them.  Not sure about the night vision since I have motion activated lights, but the pictures and video are very clear.  I only tried it once without the lights on, and it seemed okay.

Picture was perfect. Night vision was really good.Problems: In the first week, it stopped working twice. Went ""Offline"". I had to remove the doorbell with the provided tool, which is a pain, then remove the batteries and then reinstall the batteries to reset it.It worked after doing so each time, but if I was away from home, I would have no security!Now I can't even get the thing to work at all. I removed the batteries, pressed the reset button until the red light was flashing, and even deleted it from my account and then readded it.Finally got it back online a few days later.I'm torn on this product. I had issues with one of the interior cams too. When I was about to give up, it started working again.Note: After the initial recording time, it will not record again for 10 seconds. This cannot be changed in the settings. I wish it could! I think thats why they say the batteries can last up to two years. Well, a lot can happen in those 10 seconds.

It’s blurred out almost completely one side of the picture. Yes, we have cleaned the lens. Also, when we couldn’t figure out the connectivity issue/motion, their customer support is nonexistent.

On the flip side, it never detects people walking even when they walk up to my front door. Video only starts recording as they leave.- there’s no corresponding interior bell alert.

411,Capnwalter,If you’re trying to decide between this and the ring…,"  Besides battery life which is excellent, it is inferior to my ring doorbell in every way. The camera quality is lacking even with the sync module and being connected to the same network. No matter which settings I alter, the app will not detect motion and alert me, I only get alerted for button presses. The mounting system from the doorbell to the mount is not strong and a burglar would be able to disable this camera quickly and easily. The night vision sensor is weak by default, does not reach the distances of the ring doorbell. So far not happy with these products. I had better results with other Chinese brand cameras and ring.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2022"
412,Dave K.,BAD Mounting Plate Design,"  This has got to be the worst design for a mounting plate in the history of mounting plates!  The pictures and graphics included with the package, and the animation embedded in the app for setup lead one to believe they merely need to “place the top of the doorbell at a slight angle and flush with the top of the mounting plate, so the mounting hooks align, then gently push down until it clicks”.  This may be correct.  HOWEVER, the tolerances are so tight that  you have to align everything with excruciating exactness.  It took innumerable tries and I wasn’t successful until about TWENTY MINUTES into my effort!!! When I need to change the batteries, I will likely throw the whole damned thing away, rather than deal with that nonsense again.Now, as for the rest of the unit, I like it.  Works well.  Good picture.  Easily integrates with my Blink system.  User friendly setup instructions.  Were it not for the aforementioned turd of a mounting plate, 5 stars.  I hope the engineers will come up with a better design before my batteries die.  Looking forward to the Gen2 doorbell if they do.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2021"

Replaced the door angle  mount with the Blink mount. Truly wish this was provided with the units, cost me a little extra.  Hardwired my doorbell wires to the blink bell.  And it does take some effort to ensure you mount the bell on the mount properly - recommend looking at the configuration the back of the bell before simply attempting to slide (as it wont stay on).

415,Jared Morrison,Close but not yet,"  Compared to Ring, it just feels cheap. The mount is extremely frustrating and the wired terminals are flush with the mount, posing the possibility of a short if your door trim is aluminum. The video is decent, really good color. Overall, not the same quality as the other Blink cameras. I returned mine and put the 5 year old original Ring doorbell back on.Update: Blink sent me a replacement camera to re-evaluate. At this price point, it does it's job well, it is much cheaper than the Ring. I do like the video quality better than my original Ring. The Ring is more expensive but the device itself feels more solid. I also like the time lapse recording in the Ring app, Blink lacks this BUT, I pay $30/yr for the Ring video storage. One huge plus is having the doorbell as well as security cameras all in one app. I do still feel that the mount isn't very user friendly, you must slide it down onto the little post, then snap it in. It comes with a key that slides in to release it from the mount... I suspect this key will be lost immediately...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2021"
416,DVS,Easy Installation,  The doorbell cameras are a nice addition to this lineup of smart cameras. Installation is pretty simple if you know how to use a drill and a screwdriver. They can be installed with or without connecting to a homes doorbell wiring; but the battery-operating-only mode does not facilitate live-viewing and being able to take quick snapshots to use for thumbnail images. The wired installation mode works just as well as the indoor cameras with addition of being able to integrate with compatible Alexa units to trigger custom “doorbell” sounds and alert you as to which doorbell is being rung. It can be wired directly to your existing door bell chime and trigger it with steps listed in the setup app for mechanical and digital chime boxes.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2021"

I adjusted the motion area in the app to remove the street. Notifications continued. I used Advanced settings and adjusted further and notifications stopped in the daylight, but night with car lights they started again. I adjusted more to stop the car notifications and I thought I was set.The next day I had 3 deliveries and no notification. When I went out to get my packages I got the notification. Ugh.So I thought I would mount the angle bracket to tilt the camera a bit inwards. I mounted the bracket and when screwing the camera base to the bracket the screw head broke off rendering the bracket useless as a screw is now stuck in one of only 2 mounting holes.

No need to add a dongle to the wiring inside.  Just scan the code on the back of the new button, using my Ipad, follow the instructions, and wire it up outside  The blink installation app tested the system, and had a fix for what might have gone wrong.  Picture is clear, wide angle, and the doorbell works as intended.  A note:  allow the app to set things up.  This takes longer than one might think.  Let it do its job.

425,F. Asher,"Easy, pretty, cheap-y","  I've been refusing to buy a video doorbell because (1) I already have a Blink outdoor camera pointing at my front door (and a good old doorbell), (2) the video doorbells I've considered in the past cost too much for what I'm willing to pay, and (3) I didn't want to bother with complicated installations.When this became available on sale ($35), I jumped at the opportunity.  Installation was as easy as drilling two holes, screwing two screws, and placing the doorbell onto the frame.  I didn't have the installation challenges others have posted about (you should go read those).  I already have a Blink system in place so adding this to that was straightforward, plus I don't have to pay extra for video recordings.Picture quality is great for what this item is intended.Motion sensitivity is at least a good 15-20 yards.  Cars passing by on the neighborhood street triggered the motion sensor and notifications to my phone, so I turned the motion sensor off which should also help with battery life (and I still have my front door Blink camera to capture video when motion triggers it).The best part of this for me is the Alexa doorbell routine, which includes different chimes, from the basics to the seasonal ones.  Someone presses the doorbell, Sleigh Bells chime plays, and Alexa tells me someone is at the front door.  Also, I didn't experience a delay between the doorbell press and the Alexa routine notification (I recently upgraded to a WiFi 6 system, so I'm sure that helped).",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2021"

The only disappointment in the Blink line so far is the lack of live view in Alexa. I am told it is because Blink has its own live view.

I measured the voltage and it was within the 16-24Vac range. I was still able to ring my inside chime using my original switch connected to the blink electrical contacts.I was happy with how quickly I could contact and connect with tech support even at 10pm on a Saturday night. They suggested that I 1) try taking the batteries out, 2) try removing the sync module from the app and remove the doorbell as well and then add them again.The more I thought about this the more I didn't like how complicated this is to ring my door bell inside. I don't want my inside chime depending on software, batteries, or wifi. If someone rings the door bell, I want the doorbell to ring inside no matter what (as long as there is power to the home). Simple as that.The biggest frustration I had was with the removal tool design. It took several minutes for me to use the tool to pop the blink doorbell off the wired mount. After that it was just as difficult to reattach it since the plastic part that is supposed to provide the locking mechanism was pushed all the way in and needed to be bent out again.Much room for improvement. It's doubtful they will have a future design that simplifies the internal chime ringing, but if they do I may consider trying this again.

That may not be a problem on most homes with wider trim boards around the door, but on mine it is.Another thing that needed patience to solve was poking around on your Blink software to get it to ring on my phone plus my hardwired in-house existing doorbell.

You have to have a subscription to be able to view the videos/images after the fact, which isn't a huge deal. The app is super slow so it's almost impossible to answer the door from you phone or say anything because it takes minutes to load. It hooks up to the Alexa but you cannot use the alexa show to view the video when someone is at the door, which in my opinion it should do automatically or should at least be a setting. Also, the doorbells are named by their serial number and no matter what avenue you take to rename them, when the doorbell is rung, it will ring the chosen style on the alexa, but it will then say ""There is someone at the VM215358132DS1535"" which is SUPER annoying.

442,Tom K,Not very useful,"  I really wanted to like this video doorbell. I was looking for something to provide security for the front of my house with good motion detection and picture. However, after several weeks of use, it does not meet my expectations.Pros:-great price-the video quality is pretty clear-notifications come pretty quickly after a triggering event, when it actually worksCons:-the app is not very good. When there's a triggering event, it takes you to live view, rather than showing the recording it just made. You then have to manually go to that recording.-as many reviews have stated, this is not the easiest to install. The first problem I encountered was that it did not seem to have all the necessary installation equipment. I wanted to mount it with the included wedge, but the screws provided did not seem to be the correct size. First, the long screws that are supposed to go into the wall were not the correct size as they only partially went in. Further, the smaller screws (which are supposed to help with installing the back plate to the wedge) would not tighten. Ultimately, I could not install the wedge and just went with the back plate, using some spare screws that I already had. Not a good start. When it came to installing the doorbell to the back plate it was a struggle to get it on. You have to press down very hard until it is properly secure. Given the flimsy plastic, I can see this breaking. Luckily, though, that didn't happen to me.-the motion detection is horrible.  This feature was hit or miss, at best, and is a deal breaker. It would often pick up activity outside the designated activity zone (like cars going by) and completely miss activity within the designated zone. For example, on one day, it missed each of the following triggering activities: two package deliveries, me walking up my walkway, walking up my front stairs, me standing in front of the door for several seconds to unlock it (mind you, this is directly in front of the video doorbell), me entering the house, me walking away from the house, and my neighbor coming up my stairs to ring my doorbell.  I adjusted the sensitivity level, but nothing helped. Frankly, the motion detection on this device is complete garbage.If you only want to see who is actually ringing your doorbell, then purchase this doorbell.

Resolution is average, probably wouldn't stand up in a murder investigation or trial, but I recognize my mail lady and my wife who steps onto the front porch 15 times daily.

The doorbell worked fine, but wouldn't click on the backplate. After hours on the phone with I don't know how many people of customer service they agreed it was a hardware issue and I was sent a new backplate. This one was of far better quality than the first flimsy one (sale item??) BUT it doesn't fit the doorbell. The plate is too small and too thick.

Doorbell unit is working great with the rest of my Blink camera's Thanks again Alex. (Original review) I purchased a Blink doorbell unit to add to my Blink outdoor camera set of 5. Could not get doorbell unit to connect. After not being able to connect I checked the batteries that came with it and they were dead. OK no big deal it happens, so I replace the batteries and still have to play with it awhile to connect. Finally connect for like a day then not working again. Checked if batteries were good again and finally got it connected for a short time then off again. Contacted support for replacement and they had me turn on an access button on the Blink APP so they could see the unit, which I wasn't really comfortable about. Next day they what me to download another APP to run a signal scan and give them the info.  I'm not comfortable giving all this internet access out. I told them I have one of the Blink outdoor cameras 3 feet away from the doorbell camera and it works fine so signal in the area is good.

Very misleading because the video I watched said you could answer the door from the Echo show using the blink doorbell camera.I would say, it works very well as a doorbell but not much more than a $14 electronic doorbell and chime set you can find here.  The camera is good quality but useless if you can't see who is at the door until after the clip has been recorded and you get a notification.  Also, any time I actually *has* let us do a live feed (on the phone app only), if I go to use the voice function and talk to the person at the door, it says camera has stopped and I lose the feed entirely.

The doorbell function does work as intended, however I bought this to link with Amazon and alexa so it can notify me via my echo show /studio /dot devices around the house also.Next we have the subject of the subscription fee. It's per device, which means if you have the 5 cameras and the doorbell your paying a lot per month. Why the hell is it not an account based system that you set up an account pay 20$ a month and you can have unlimited devices? These things don't work without wifi so if the power goes out they are useless as a security system.My suggestion for people is buy a standalone camera setup with recorder. You can even set most up for remote login via your phone, several are internet connected and can notify you if there's motion. Sure some are more expensive but don't think for a minute this is cheap vs those. What those cost up front this will rack up in the long term with subscription fees.

481,Jordan,Ring v Blink,"  I've had a Ring for the last year and now just 'upgraded' to the new Blink since I already had 4 other Blink cameras at my house.  The Ring video always failed and the battery did not last long but was rechargeable.  I wasn't impressed.  I don't know yet how long the Blink Doorbell batteries will last but I can tell you the quality, video, and everything is a perfect comparison to the Ring.  Because it's now a part of my Blink system, it's more convenient having all my security videos in one spot.Getting the doorbell to 'ring' through my echo devices has been difficult and still doesn't work so if someone rings the doorbell it only just gives me an alert on my phone and doesn't ""ring"" through my house.  I'm working on trying to fix that but be aware its a challenge.  The alexa app has yet to 'see' the doorbell.Also mounting it was awkward as the back plate is pretty small and doesn't ""click"" in easily especially if the surface isn't insanely flat.  I had to use the tiniest shims to get the thing to 'lock' in and even then it feels like it could fall off my front wall at any point.  A simple thick gasket on the back of the plate would have remedied this easily.  I can only imagine if you're trying to secure this to brick or other facia.

482,Jordan,If I would have known,"  OK this seemed like a good purchase at face value, but we didn't know we pretty much needed the subscription plan on order to use the features or to decrease time of video initiation (Shorten the time between video activation when someone trips the motion sensor). The subscription plan is pretty cheap, but I could have gone with another brand if i would have been able to have access to that information to be able to make an informed decision based on finances.  When installing the doorbell the backing plate went on fine but the little hooks broke off when putting the actual doorbell on. If you have issues with internet it disconnects and you have no access without physically being there to reset the internet connection via your smart device. Overall I have not been happy with the product and have been thinking about just throwing it away since during the free trial period it worked for about 1 week. Most of that blame though falls on me because who finds out there doorbell doesn't work when they are home, and remembers to reconnect every time their internet fails?

Drove 2 into the angled wall mount, then connected the 2 wires to the doorbell's back plate and screwed that to the mount.  Setup is through the app and took about 5 minutes.  What wasn't clear initially was the need for the batteries, regardless if you choose to wire it to your existing doorbell or not.  But keeping the batteries in is required :-)  It connected to my existing Blink system so no additional setup steps.  Halloween will be the big test as I anticipate lots of trick-or-treaters and will report back!

And no explanation is given how the ""wired"" connection integrates with the power/batteries. GOOGLE ""do I need batteries"" and you will get a mish-mash of unclear responses. Does wired prolong the battery life?  Who know???  Like most, I found the latching mechanism very difficult to use.  Needs a new design.

As usual, the flexibility in the app is great, quality of video is good.Only things I would change:  1) include a wedge by default, I cannot imagine too many cases where you wouldn't want one,  2) suggest the drill bit size to use for mounting the backplate, my initial guess was too small,  3) putting the doorbell onto the backplate seems to be touchy.

I purchased the first wave of Blink cameras a few years ago so I don't have the subscription fees most people are complaining about its waved for me. I enjoy the easy accessibility of viewing my house while I'm at work on my phone. Cameras are pretty vivid and of good quality picture for the most part. They capture motion pretty well and allow you to set the zones you wish to record. The doorbell will notify you when someone rings the bell and it can be linked with an existing Echo Dot which is a nice feature.ConsThe cameras lack in real time live view. It's a few seconds delay in what you see and some times the video quality gets choppy. I have 400mbps internet through my ISP, I shouldn't be having a delay in connectivity. Also the back plate for these cameras are trash. Whoever designed this camera was a dick.

It’s no one’s fault, but I was quite sad about it. I searched to see if they have a plate to cover the old holes. No luck. Secondly, it was unbelievable hard to mount.  I tried and eventually gave up.  I could mount Ring 1 and Ring 2 door bells without any problems. But, this Blink doorbell was not eat at all.  If I think about it, snapping on the Blink camera to the mount was pretty difficult also.  Maybe Blink should do a normal human mounting test.

None of the proposed fixes worked. I noticed the provided batteries were expired and tried some that had been working for other cameras. I purchased new Li batteries and tried those. No luck.I then decided to see if it was worth my time to continue mucking about and tried to physically connect the camera to the baseplate.

516,TMuniz,"Good start, but needs to mature a bit","  On the whole, the new Blink Doorbell is a nice entry level video doorbell. It integrates nicely into your existing system, but does require a Sync Module 2, which comes with the standard package. The video quality is good, and it can integrate with your existing hard-wired doorbell, as long as it meets the voltage requirements.As an early adopter, I understand that some expected feature may not be there yet. One of the big ones that is missing is the Auto LiveView for Alexa Show devices. On other doorbells, when the button is pressed, the video will automatically display on selected show devices. That option is NOT there on this device, and I'm not sure if it's on the list of future enhancements. Granted, this device is very inexpensive compared to the Ring doorbells, and that might be one feature they won't put here to try and get you to upgrade. Because of this lacking feature, I will probably be returning it and going a different direction.If you don't need Auto LiveView on your Show devices, then I would say go ahead and give it a try.**UPDATE**On a positive note, Blink did reach out to and are working with me on my issues, so it appears their customer support is above average. Thanks you.On a less positive note, I did discover another small shortcoming. As of this writing, none of the Blink cameras, including the Blink Doorbell, are accessible from Alexa Routines. Yes, you can view the camera on a Show device, and you can have it announce when the doorbell is pressed on Echo devices, but you can not schedule the arming or disarming of the motion detection services through an Alexa routine.

When the sun is shining on the cameras, turn them down.Other than that, the only issue is that you cannot continuously record with the Blink app. I know it’s because these are battery operated, but that feature should be allowed. If the batteries die fast, then they die fast. It should be up to the owners if they want to keep buying batteries.Continuous recording and playback, would give you the ability to go back and see something you were not looking for. Let’s say you noticed something missing from your yard, or a neighbor had an issue and wants to see your footage as X time. You could do so. Right now, you don’t have that option if it wasn’t motion captured.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2022"
525,Justin Berndt,Good doorbell cams with a couple issues,"  For me, the mounting was ok, the problem is you feel like you are going to break something when you attach it, it takes so much force.  I can't get Alexa to announce the bell ringing.  I contacted blink support and after having me disable/enable the skill, it still doesn't work.  Blink gave up and said it was an Alexa issue.  Ah, the old finger pointing... not my fault, it's Amazon.

526,Steve'Oh,Decent Product - Screws Missing - Poor Instructions.,"  Just received this doorbell and it’s a decent enough product.  If you have a ‘Blink’ system you’ll know the setup, it’s basically just another camera in your system.  I replaced a Kangaroo doorbell - which was not great.The picture quality is very good and the sensor is also very good.  The only issue I had was installation.  I managed to install pretty easily, but only after I watched the very basic videos, and then struggled with fitting the doorbell onto the backplate for 25 minutes.  I also had to supply my own screws to fit the doorbell backplate to the corner bracket.  That was annoying.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2021"
527,Will,Awesome Camera with a couple of flaws,"  Blink’s new doorbell camera is a great option for homeowners who are looking for an inexpensive high quality product.  I have an original Blink sync module along with 10 blink wireless cameras providing surveillance for my home.  The 1080 HP resolution for video and still pics from my cameras are really good and the new door bell camera does not disappoint.  I actually had a RING doorbell camera that I replaced with the Blink due to the video quality of the RING being sub par.  Same 1080 HP resolution as the Blink but the first 3-5 seconds of the RING would always be distorted and hard to make out what you’re looking at.  No issue with the new Blink doorbell camera the quality of video and picture are excellent.  It’s easy to install the camera comes with a template and the hardware you need.  It’s powered by two AA Energizer Lithium batteries which can last a long time in non high traffic areas.  This leads me to the draw backs of what I thought Blink could improve on if they do come out with a second generation like they did with the XT2.First draw back  is that Blink states that the new  doorbell cam can operate wireless or wired which is true and that the wired option only allows for it to be connected to your homes door bell which is also true.  You will still need the 2 AA lithium batteries to provide power.  Hopefully they come out with a second generation and if they do they should make it so that it has its own onboard lithium battery and that wired means wired for power and to allow connection to your home’s doorbell.  Also the light around the button does not stay on at all times probably due to the fact that it would drain the batteries real quick.  That light is a major deterrent for the thieves when they see it they know that it’s saying yup we got a doorbell camera and a bunch of other cameras too which in most cases keep the thieves away.  That would be the only two things I would like to see improved on if they do indeed make a second generation.  As for me I’ll be returning my new Blink doorbell camera due to the two reasons I stated above it’s back to the RING for me, just for now.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2021"

After multiple attempts both with the base unmounted and then mounted, I was able to secure the unit.

The doorbell itself has a chime. This is a useless feature since it is physically located outside and would not be readily heard from the inside of a house.2. Integration into Alexa was easy, but features that I would expect are not available such as automatically turning on the video to see who pressed the doorbell.3. I hardwired the doorbell - easy job. But it takes 2 or more pushes to engage my existing indoor chime. This is a problem since visitors will not know that and think that nobody is home. I've reset everything and started from the top, but the problem remains.4. Battery is still needed for the doorbell to work even after hardwired to a power source. This defeats the purpose of the hardwire.Had I known these problems, I would have considered other doorbell brands that are also compatible wtih Alexa.

I've also used the two way communication very effectively with our UPS driver a few times. I would definitely recommend them. HOWEVER, there is one big flaw in my opinion that now has us looking at new cameras and is the reason for the low overall rating; it's the mobile app. While the app has many excellent features, it has a flaw that was not evident until after having the system for a while and they do not appear to be interested in fixing it. The notification alert and volume are NOT customizable at all. This means that any alert from a camera in the middle of the night sounds like any other alert be it email, text, etc. What this means is that over time, you will begin to ignore them if you even hear them at all at night. Maybe this wouldn't matter to you, but I and my spouse want to know when a camera is activated at the time it's activated, not the next day several hours later. A good example is my pager alert.

The doorbell cannot discriminate between cars and people the way Ring does. This can (sort of) be remedied with activity zones, but it is far from a real solution.Be aware that arming/disarming the system is all-or nothing. You can choose to get a motion alert every time a bird flies by or no alerts whatsoever.As others have stated, the wall mount is atrocious, but at less than $50, sacrifices must be made. I am certain that I will be replacing these in the near future, not because of functionality, but because the doorbell may detach if the doorbell is pressed too hard in the wrong direction.The necessity of a sync module makes this an acceptable addition if you already use blink cameras, but kind of a pain if you don’t.All in all, I don’t regret buying these.

They walk up to the door, unlock the storm and then the door and enter. Nothing has ever been recorded. I go out the door to check my mail and come back in and I am never picked up. When the door bell is rung there is a delay with it alerting my phone, sometimes as long as 10 minutes, sometimes it never alerts my phone at all. When the door bell is rung it does not begin recording until the people have entered my door if I was expecting them and left the door unlocked. I have never been able to talk to the person at the door if it did by chance ring through to my phone quickly.

I have been using both for almost a week now.The biggest downside to this system is that you don't receive notifications right away, nor does it instantly start recording. I have noticed for both the doorbell AND outdoor camera that it takes up to 5 seconds before recording takes place or for a notification to be sent to your phone. While this isn't a huge issue, those 5 seconds could be crucial in the event of an home invasion or somebody walking up to your porch to steal your packages. For example, I could be walking up to the door to unlock it, but it isn't until the key is actually in the door that the camera will send a notification and starts recording. So, it lags behind a bit.The video quality during the day is good - a little blurry but still possible to make out faces. I have not had to use the night vision much, but you can still capture a face if a person is close enough to the camera. The audio quality is good - I have not noticed any static.Setting the system up was pretty easy. I did have to play around with the sensitivity, as there were multiple false detections made by the camera. The sensitivity comes set at 5, which is sensitive enough to detect leaves in the distance or somebody 15-20 feet away walking past your home. I turned it down in an attempt to save battery life.Overall, it adds a layer of protection to your home and it is a good doorbell camera for the price, but a drawback may be because of how long it takes to receive a notification when motion is detected.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2022"

At first, during the free trial period, performance was OK, but not great. The interior camera might or might not trigger on video. One of the exterior cameras never worked correctly even though I moved the Sync 2 module closer to it and it showed good signal strength. There is a feature when you are subscribed where the camera takes a picture once per hour and creates a daily clip show of those images. However, there are no time stamps on the images so it's very difficult to determine what time of day is being shown. I contacted Blink support regarding this feature and did not get a satisfactory answer on whether they would accept this as a feature request or not.After the end of the trial subscription, the cameras started acting very intermittent. At this point, I can't get live view to operate on ANY of the cameras. The doorbell cam is the only one that will sometimes store motion detected video.The battery life is supposed to be 2 years on the external cameras. However, I've had to change the batteries after 4 months. The doorbell camera is supposed to be able to take power from the 22vac doorbell circuit but that has never worked correctly.

562,Mp,Extremely pleased!,  We love this thing!! It was incredibly easy to install into our existing doorbell wiring. I was a bit confused after the first install as states that we can plug directly into our existing door bell wiring which it did but it doesnt function without batteries. I was slightly disappointed about this as it doesnt say anything about still requiring batteries even when hard wired. Besides this everything else is great!

563,VRW,"Video quality superb, but usability very lacking","  The setup process and actual quality of the video and motion detection is top notch.Viewing the video is another story. The camera does not allow for event recording and live viewing to occur at the same time. This means when you receive a notification that someone is at your door, or motion has been detected in general, you can’t immediately switch to live view to see who is there. This would be fine if the app took it into account, but it doesn’t. It hangs indefinitely trying to connect. Then, when you back up and try again, the system is “busy”. By the time you actually can view live, it’s almost guaranteed that the person at the door is either gone or pressing the doorbell again, which restarts the cycle.Suffice to say, I won’t be recommending these in the future. I was disappointed to see that even though it can be hardwired, it still requires and runs off of batteries, and live viewing being essentially useless is the final straw.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2021"

I did this under advanced setting with the help of Blink customer service.  After this did not work, even putting the entire camera under the privacy zone didn't work, they sent a replacement.  The replacement has the same exact issue, so I assume this is a flaw in the technology.  Maybe if you live on a less busy street and want it to go off for any/all motion this would be a good camera for you.

There's only a 60 second response time from the phone, however the notifications take at least  minutes to come through (I've adjusted all of my phone settings and used to have a Ring at a different house that worked perfectly, so it's not the phone). I would definitely not recommend this until they figure out how to make it user friendly. Hopefully they will improve the software with time, but this is very much not worth it when there are multiple other doorbells that are superior and in the same price range.

Everything was well placed and the material felt good to the touch, first impression was really good.  The device itself was really good and very responsive.  I enjoyed the simple instructions and step by step the programing made everything run seamless.  The QR codes was brilliant and connected everything really well without problems.  One really good thing that I did not see in other positives about the product is the easy connection to the home's doorbell.  Super easy, not to bash on other brand, but my neighbor's installation of the RING was a nightmare and they had to get and fish new wire to have the house doorbell work with their device, which is why I was so hesitant to purchase a doorbell cam.  This was so easyThe bad: I was a little confused  as to what the ""system"" was when installing the app and it meant it was your ecosystem, nothing major.  I was a little disappointed with the mounting hardware, it was a little thin and screws that attach it to wall were a little small.

Sync module connected to my router no problem  in about 30 seconds using the Blink app. Then using the app each additional camera setup and connection was a breeze. Love the ease of use of the blink app to adjust individually adjust settings  for each camera. Pictures and videos through app are very good. I use my cameras to monitor my front door, porch and garage when the garage door is open using my Echo show. Linking your Blink system to Alexa is also very easy using your Alexa app. I plan to purchase some indoor mini cameras  to add to my Blink system.

Once that's over and you decide to move to local storage, the interface becomes so unpleasant to use that you won't even open the app. With the cloud plan you can delete multiple videos that are stored at one time. With local storage you have to load one video at a time which seems like it takes way longer then it should and then you can delete that one video and move on to the next one. That ofcourse is if you dont get a repetitive ""system is busy please wait"" error. And you will get the error over and over and over again. Maybe I'm jumping to conclusions but it seems like they've made the local storage or free option so horrible so people opt into the monthly subscription. Save your money, look elsewhere.

Easy to install and motion is alot more sensitive so it records alot sooner than the skybell.Update:Battery life is not good. I only get a few days using the enegizer lithium batteries and its connected to the sync module. I assumed that its wired to my doorbell system it would get the power thru the transformer.

606,Schlitze,What a deal this video doorbell is!,"  I already had a Blink video camera system, and thought the video doorbell would be a nice addition.  For starters, the price of $49.99 seemed too good to be true.  I had priced Ring doorbells and a few others, but this seemed like a steal.  When I received it, I installed it immediately, and my Blink app recognized it right off the bat.  The video quality is great, the sensitivity is great, and I couldn't be happier with this unit.  I wired it to my existing doorbell, and with a few clicks on the app, everything worked.

609,Michael Reeves,Won't Mount Properly....Yet,"  Electronic set up and integration with my existing Blink system was very easy. Physically installing the doorbell was not much more difficult (I used the wedge and attached the doorbell to my existing doorbell wires). However, I'm unable to get the doorbell unit to make proper connection with the contacts on the mounting plate, hence I can't get my house doorbell to ring as advertised. This is important as the doorbell alerts anyone in the house that someone is at the door (makes sense, right?) and not everyone in my home is connected to the Blink system. I'd recommend holding off on this purchase until it does what isadvertised.UPDATE 1: Third time is a charm...doorbell mounted and connected to home system. After the calibration step, the Blink doorbell activates the house doorbell. All is well...almost.

I had to take it off the house, and reset it and set it up again. (Which for some reason took 30 minutes because it said it couldn’t connect to the doorbell again) When it still wouldn’t connect I had to delete the doorbell system from the Blink app and start completely over.

I read a lot about the mounting plate not working. After a few minutes of fidgeting with it, I simply gave it a light tap with the butt of my screwdriver and it snapped right in. A con is that I can't simply open the app to a live view, someone has to ring the doorbell. For this reason, I also can't comment on the night vision until someone rings the doorbell.

Keep in mind you may have to purchase an angled back plate depending on how or where you mount it.

653,Jayhawk,Just plain didn't work - 48 hour wait for customer service is now going on 5 days,"  I like absolutely nothing about this failure of a product. Installation was a pain, the material is flimsy, and even though the system was connected and detecting movement, the camera never showed video from the camera on the app. Customer service said it would take 48 hours to get back to me on my issue, and five days later I still haven't heard from them. Utter garbage.  At least the return is fairly easy.

Advertised as not requiring a subscription, unless you wanted to view historical views, which would have to be recorded.  Not interested in anything but who is at my door NOW.  Very disappointed to find that once the ""trial period"" had expired, it becomes just a doorbell - not a viewer.  Camera function becomes useless.

655,Mr_Noobie,Easier than thought!,"  I had read several reviews before attempting the install and was a bit apprehensive.  As others have said, it is difficult to get the two pieces connected.  Although I found it easier once the back plate was secured to the wall.  The video which is sent via email or on your blink app clearly shows step by step installation instructions...it was VERY easy.  I didn't use a drill, had I - it would have been even easier.  I attached the 2 wires so the bell still rings in the house as before.  The instructions stated it didn't matter which wire went to which post, which gave me peace of mind.The picture is clear & shows a wide range.  I considered using a wedge, but there's no need in my case.Total installation time was less than half an hour - start to finish - including video check & app connection.  The installation video was step by step and such clear instructions.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2021"

Unlike Ring which is always illuminated. Crappy and misleading.2) Won't work without batteries installed.3) WEAK, WEAK mounting system, a real joke. As others stated, won't likely last too long. In comparison, the RING mount is very stout.The only upside I see now is cost, and if you have a grandfathered blink account, it should be free.Overall, they missed the mark substantially, and I hope they rectify these issues and reward those of us that went in on good faith only to be disappointed.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2021"

Will recommend the wedge to turn the camera and a back adapter to fit on the siding. The camera already payed for itself and then some. On Christmas Eve I got an alert and we have multiple cameras outside that sometimes send a alert that is a tree branch moving or headlights but this was the door bell and for that to set off something was close. I found someone breaking into our car. We were able to call the police and they showed up and arrested him all without alerting the robber that he was seen. All the cameras did there job and got good images and video of the whole event that where saved and sent to the police. It’s cheap insurance to have one.

Setting up zones and settings was easy.  The app is great.  The free cloud storage available to me is very useful however i wish it was larger.  My biggest complaint is the wall mount.  It is a piece of plastic that feels flimsy and took about an hour to mount.  They should send everyone who buys this a sturdier mount.  Also, I have it connected to my existing doorbell.

(The Ring camera allowed giving others restricted permission to view videos). The Blink system only allows full administrative rights if you want others to see video. So if you have children, roommates, significant others, you have to log into the account with your credentials giving them full control of the system.

From the start the doorbell wasn’t syncing right. Went to install it wired on to my doorbell and after an hour of messing with it called costumer service, they told me it just wasn’t working so they’d send me another one. Got the replacement doorbell camera and it took me maybe 3 minutes to set it up. Everything was working fine and was even working with my chime. Wake up the next morning and the doorbell isn’t working AGAIN. The app kept saying the battery’s were low but they’d only been in for about 12 hours at this point and they’re supposed to last something like 2 years?. Replaced the battery’s and got it working again but it feels like it’s just a matter of time before another issue arises. Don’t waste your money, time or sanity.

Set up and installation was easy and it worked initially for a few hours. Then we stopped receiving notifications even though activity was being recorded. We logged out of the app, restarted our phones and even deleted and reinstalled the app as suggested. This fixed the problem…for a few hours. We tried resetting everything again, even deleted the camera and re-added it but still no notifications. We changed the batteries even though they were the brand new ones that came with the box and should not already be dead. Oddly, that resolved the problem, until the next day when the device suddenly went offline and took 5+ attempts to re-add it successfully.

Just purchased the Blink doorbell and while Blink really pressured me to buy their monthly storage plan, I thought it unnecessary since my outdoor cameras stored videos just fine without it. However, once the mandatory trial period finished, it has become impossible to save videos from the Blink doorbell.

But after 5 days the doorbell which I have wired to 24V power says the batteries are almost dead. Apparently despite being hooked to power the doorbell will still only draw power from the batteries and since I didn't have a sync module the doorbell is already dead after 5 days. The only reason I don't give it one star is because customer support is sending me a sync module for free.

Was sent a new backplate, I think this one might have been improved because today I successfully changed it without the little tabs breaking off like before.So with the sync module and I think they may have made some updates to help with external power. This time the batteries have lasted a little over two months. Which not great but its acceptable. This time the doorbell said the batteries were low about a month in, and then lasted another month.

Everyone in the house need to share same username and password since there is only one account allowed.  Therefore if someone wants to change the settings or disarm the camera, everyone is effected.  2,) Also, suddenly 90% of the notifications are delayed between 10 mins to 30 mins.  So if the doorbell is pressed i find out up to 1/2 hr later!  Same goes for all motion detection…. So if a package is delivered and I’m home it can be taken from my porch before i know it’s delivered.  That’s a PROBLEM and it negates the reason i bought this in the first place.  I will say that of they would fix these 2 issues i would recommend to a friend as the picture quality is decent and it is a relatively low cost.

It never notifies me once the mail lady has delivered my mail, and my mailbox is attached onto my front porch (as pointed out in photo). Also, mind you the mail carrier has to walk up my front steps from the side walk and come up to my porch to driver my mail (my house is on top of the hill). There’s options to edit sensitivity and edit what zones in the camera’s view you would like notified if there’s movement, but no way to increase the sensitivity of my mailbox unless I want the system to notify and record EVERY time a car drives by.. oh, not to mention I have one at my back door that doesn’t always pick up when someone pulls into my driveway and walks up to my house.

711,Matt Hansen,No light at to easily see / find it at night,"  Good doorbell, but three things to know.  1. There is no light that is continuously on, so at night, it is hard to see, even when hard wired.  The light only comes on after you push the button (but at that point, what use is that?).  RING and even my previous $2.50 doorbell button lit up (constantly). 2. If you have two Amazon accounts linked on Echo Show as household accounts, Alexa has to be on the correct account in order for the integration to work.  BLINK only works with one assigned Amazon account on your echo show.  3.  There is no way to time your Echo Show to stop the live video if you have set it up to come on whenever the doorbell rings.  So, if someone rings your doorbell and you are away from home, the video will stay live on your echo show (if you have set it up to come on) for 10 minutes or more before it goes off, draining your battery signicantly (batteries are not cheap).",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2021"

If someone rings the doorbell, nothing.  We’ve reset apps, phones, Echos, the doorbell itself.  Nothing seems to help.  I thought I was disappointed in our Ring doorbell because it would take 2 minutes to load a video, but at least it sensed motion or let us know if someone rang the doorbell.  We have a blink mini that worked just fine, but once we added the doorbell, the mini goes offline constantly.  I would not recommend anyone waste their money on this as it certainly does not perform like it is meant to.

The base bracket is too thin and it would not be in good flat status after screwed to the door frame. Then it is impossible to clip the doorbell on it tightly. Tried screw/unscrew base for couple times and never worked, we end up to glue it directly to door frame. You are warned.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2021"

Since we have indoor blink cams too, and we don't want them to trigger on motion 24/7, we have a schedule.  Well the schedule is all cams or no cams.  Blink engineers were so short sighted here.  How they did not even consider the fact that indoor cams and outdoor cams should run on different schedules, is beyond me.  This is a normal basic function of security camera systems.I did speak with blink support about it, and their best suggestion was to create a second system in my account and put all outdoor cams in it.  And while I agree that will work, it's not ideal at all.  I put in for a feature request for the schedule to be device, device type, or device group controllable.

Nothing too bad, just a couple second delay, but it makes it hard to communicate easily. It's basically like using Zoom I suppose. It also wouldn't let 2 people look at the feed at the same time on different phones (same Blink account), but that was before I had it fully set up so I'll try that again.

797,smartsubbu,blink doorbell doesn't connect to Echo 5 2nd gen or echo devices  even the Sync Module,"  I am updating my review from 1 to 2 stars because Amazon customer service has been very responsive. However, I have invested hours trying to make the doorbell  make the most basic things like being able to hear the announcement on your echo devices or use the camera in live mode and either is very itinerant or doesn't work.  Any  IP camera in this range price would connect to your wireless network and you would be able to see video and use the microphone easily. This one doesn't.  Is just a doorbell where the person who rings the bell is able to hear it, the notification to your phone is pretty impractical and right now is not even working on my device even with the the sync module. I tried to troublehoot this with technical support but we had some communications issues. I'll keep updating .

798,Quackers,Too slow to respond to doorbell via app,"  Pros: Reasonably clear instructions. Straight forward to mount on the wall with included angled doorbell mount. A snap to connect to existing doorbell wiring. Uneventful pairing with Sync Module 2.Cons: The key issue:- when the Blink doorbell is pressed, the video signal via the Blink App takes far too long to allow conversation with (or even a sight of) the person at the door - they have long gone. My doorbell and sync module are both within 10 feet of the router with no significant obstructions. The doorbell does not operate (at all) without the sync module 2 hub - additional cost. A USB memory dongle also has to be purchased if clips are to be saved locally - potentially an additional cost but not necessary with the paid cloud subscription service. The sync module 2 hub is a ""wifi extender"" - and when paired with the router it noticeably slowed the rest of my home wifi network.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2022"
799,EBS,"Quick notification, but lags when trying to watch live video","  I was very close to buying a ring doorbell because i really needed a doorbell and wanted the extra perks of having the camera doorbell. When i saw that blink was releasing one, i decided to wait since i already have a blink camera system and figured it'd be easier to connect it with my current system. The mounting was very easy and took maybe less than 10 minutes. The camera quality is great and the motion detection is also great, it actually notifies and detcts quicker than the outdoor cameras. The only complaint that i have is that when i get a notification for the doorbell, it takes me to the live video which doesnt always pop up if its still recording, or sometimes it fails to even open the live view. I have connected it to my alexa so i love that my alexa also pings when there is motion detected. Overall i really do enjoy it and for only $35 i think its beyond worth the money!

Just read all your negative comments on Amazon. Hundreds of mad customers who were promised local video recording with NO SUBSCRIPTION.

As you can see from the photo, 8 days after installation it shows that the batteries need replacement. :-( I have checked the settings to make sure that the video quality and length of recording is set properly. The sensitivity is on a 2 and I’ve blocked out the street behind to keep it from triggering every time a car drives past. Overall I’m disappointed with this purchase.

899,The Pastor @ Yahoo!,Better Than Ring,"  Originally bought the Ring video doorbell for twice the price and it wouldn't even pick up the mailman coming up on our porch, didn't even pick up an Amazon delivery. We had it up for a week and it was already at 30% battery. We had gone with the Ring because it had the chime and we dont have a wired doorbell. Since it wasnt working right we decided to switch to Blink since we had their cameras. We had to also buy an echo dot to act as the doorbell in the house for the Blink doorbell so it roughly came out to the same price as the Ring and the chime but...THIS WORKS SO MUCH BETTER. The Blink catches the mailman and every delivery. I am beyond happy with it and linking it up to the echo dot was pretty easy.

In this case the Blink unit is bad - would not recommend it to anyone.  First of all, it does not come with a user manual or instructions on how to install and activate it.

913,Antwan Moore-Crumpler,Good but not great,"  The blink doorbell has a lot of positives going for it however, one major disappointment is that when you press the doorbell the echo show does not automatically show live video. I think it is misleading how it shows this in the advertisement for the products. You can see a video on the Echo show but you have to ask to see the live view. You don’t even get a live view you on the phone either, you just get alerts on both devices. Seems like a  fundamental missing, hopefully blink team is working on that. I had considered getting one for my parents who are elderly, so that when they have a visitor they can see an echo show who it is. Maybe I’m asking too much for a $50 device.

961,Wendi*B,Can’t add the doorbell to an older account without buying the sync module 2 or monthly subscription.,  We purchased a package of three cameras and a sync module in 2020. It was our understanding that we would have limited storage on all devices even if we added more without a subscription. We purchased the doorbell last month and added it to the account. I was immediately signed up for a 30 day free trial subscription. When I inquired as to what that was about I was informed that adding the new doorbell camera requires either a new sync  module 2 or a monthly subscription. Without one or the other the only thing you have access to is the live features. In my opinion this should have been explained prior to purchasing the doorbell. The main reason we went with Blink was because there was no subscription.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2021"

I will admit that the first set of batteries endured the ""Honeymoon"" phase....looking at it all of the time, and tons of motion detections. In the second round of batteries I set the motion fields for my small porch area to not catch so much wildlife.

1015,H B,Extremely easy setup,"  It was extremely easy to set it up as far as syncing, even  with an existing system, but mounting and attaching the doorbell to the base was not so easy. I definitely would’ve preferred that the base supplied was flat rather than slanted die to it making me have a larger range pretty much blindsided. The screws given to mount are short. The charity is great and the range that it does capture is amazingly alot further than I expected. I also am happy with combined package subscription price for monitoring.

1209,Sue,Excited About Free Storage,  I was excited for this to arrive to replace my Ring Doorbell. We’ve had Blink monitoring for years and have 2 sync modules. Set up was easy. The most difficult thing was 1) knowing what size drill bit to use for the anchors and 2) getting the dang cover on it!  I had similar issues with ring and once I did it a few times #2 became a breeze.I do not like that you need a tool to open it up to replace the battery.

I could not attach it by angling the top of the doorbell at the face plate as shown. I had to match up the notches from the side and then snap it on straight and then pull it down.

It stopped sending me notifications to my phone so someone rang my doorbell today and i had no idea. Tech support wasn’t much help. They got back to me fast but told me I’m SOL bc it’s not wired.

It lets you choose whether to connect it to a Sync Module or directly to the iCloud.  I chose the latter route and it worked, but no live view.  That is, the videos triggered by motion alerts or the press of the doorbell can be viewed on my iPhone, after a delay, but I cannot view it without a trigger, as I can do with my Ring doorbell, which is also wireless.The quality of the product seems fine but the plastic enclosure is a little on the cheap side.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2021"

AWS system went down and now I can't get the doorbell back on line. I tried all of the troubleshooting steps. Customer support wants me to change the batteries - even though the lights are working. The device is only a day old. How are the batteries dead after 1-day of use? I don't have Lithium batteries at the house. I tried Alkaline batteries - same result - can't get it back on line.

Getting it to work with an Echo Show 5 (or any compatible device) could be made easier with some written directions or linked video guides.  It really needs a lens that allows for a slightly lower view so that the camera can see any recently delivered packages, for example.  This Blink doorbell needs a wired power option, similar to the outdoor cameras.

   Look I’ll make this super simple. This is a budget doorbell security camera. It doesn’t stay on 24 hrs a day, it only captures video when there is movement. The quality is pretty damn good for $35 bucks on Black Friday.Do not listen to all of these reviews saying install is impossible. It is hilariously easy. Slide down and push to lock it in place. It took me less than 45 seconds to drill it and put it on. I even have a video of when I took it off to have my five year old do it with simple direction.Video is crisp, very minimal delay (less than a second from initial movement, running on my xfinity WiFi) and set up with my echo 8 was easy.Unboxing this blink doorbell, sync module 2, 1 outdoor blink camera, the echo 8 then syncing and installing everything took less than a half hour.Cool little doorbell camera, looks nice, has a good chime on the doorbell itself and to my echoI would recommend this unit to anyone who wants basic security without breaking the bank",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2021"
3947,Shane Binus,Great alternative to Ring. Need better mounting system,"  update: the official wedge mount is now $7.99I bought this because I already have 4 other Blink cameras and 2 sync modules. I'm grandfathered into the free cloud storage. So, it makes sense to pay $50 for this little doorbell.I removed my existing doorbell so I can wired it in but due to the placement of the previous doorbell, the angle is not ideal. Mounting it flat against my brick wall is cutting off a little side coverage. The $12.99 wedge accessory was a bit too much for me to pay so I printed my own wedge mount.Overall, it works well. Picture/Video quality is pretty good. Wiring it into my existing doorbell works and it also ""rings"" my doorbell on the inside.If you are interested, you can download the STL file on thingiverse.

3949,Amazon Customer,Blink is awesome,"  I was really excited about the blink doorbell, my house is covered by blink cameras and I thought this was the perfect opportunity to add the doorbell to my system. I had a ring doorbell  and currently have a Eufy, but I like the blink app and having all of my cameras in one solution. I really liked the price also. Unfortunately I had to return it to Best Buy where I bought it. My mounting location is vinyl siding and I just could not get the unit to mount to the backing. Now I have installed many video doorbells and this one was the only one I had a challenge with. In fact I had to reinstall my eufy as I just could not get the blink to lock into the backing. Even just holding it and trying to do it was a challenge. I looked to see if any vendors had created a mounting system I could use, but not as of yet. So I will wait until blink improves how the unit attaches to the face plate and then try again.An update. So blink support reached out to me after my review and sent me a replacement along with a video on installation and this one I was able to get installed. I really like blink and am glad I now have it integrated into my blink system. Great support.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2021"
3950,twila hawkins,Terrible night vision and lags,"  I went against my better judgment and decided to get this because I wanted something cheap and easy to look at my out my backyard patio door. Long story short, but I have a random peacock that strolls me neighborhood backyards, and I feed it sometimes, so I like to see when he comes up for food and such right at my backyard door. The night vision on this is absolutely terrible for some reason. There is some sort of glare on the left side. Also, there is definite lag when it comes to viewing the motion. I guess you get what you pay for.Installation was slightly difficult, but I read someone else's review on tips on how to latch the camera onto the back piece. You place it on there, make sure the hook things on the backpiece aligns with the inserts on the camera piece, and then push it downwards really hard. Then it will sort of click into place. It won't budge after that.I'm returning the device. I want to be able to view it live when the motion detector pops up, but it lags about 6 seconds, and sometimes the motion is already gone by then.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2021"
3951,Sheree Griffin,“Battery or wired” - nonsense!,"  This blink doorbell is advertised as “battery or wired”. Meaning it can operate from the battery, or it can operate from the wired connection to the doorbell transformer.False! This system always runs off battery, even when wired to a 16-24V transformer.I bought this specifically because I was tired of changing the batteries in my Blink camera.

3952,kiarra,Great.  Replaced a Ring Doorbell,"  It's only been operating for 5 days but I prefer it over the Ring doorbell I replaced.  The Ring worked fine but I was tired of having to bounce between apps for my Blink cameras and the Ring doorbell.  At $35, I'm very impressed with the quality of the Blink doorbell (I already had 1st gen sync modules for the cameras so I didn't have to buy a 2nd gen sync module).  The front door is on the north side of the house and is covered by a portico.  The only drawback of the Blink doorbell is that when it is sunny outside the camera is overwhelmed by the bright background and the face of a visitor is too dark to be sure who it is until the person gets very close to the doorbell, blocking out most of the bright background.  The Ring was better in that situation.  At night, the Blink does a bit better than the Ring in showing the face.  All in all, a very good product.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2021"
3953,Ann S.,Only chimes outside the house!,"  I had a wireless doorbell before that had a receiver in the house that I could hear. This doorbell is great, but it will only send you a phone notification. It's pointless to have the doorbell ring outside of the house where you can't hear it. Blink needs to make a chime receiver for inside the house. They didn't think this one through for the people who live in apartments who don't have doorbells. You will need an echo connected in the house to hear the chime on other words. I should have waited on this one...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2021"

My house does not have a powered front doorbell so the battery non-wired option worked great for me and made set up a breeze. It connected easily to my alexa show and the rest of my smart system. The app works very well so far and the video quality is very good for what I need it to be. I have already used the app to see when a perishable package I had been expecting arrived so I could time my lunch break to get right in the freezer.

3955,nick davis,So far so good…,"  Just got this yesterday (10/25) after pre-ordering on my wife’s Prime Account, hoping it would ship and arrive on the 21st when it was first available, but anyhow, I digress. I’ve set it up temporarily with Velcro strips to see how it performs facing out our street which has low traffic during the day. It picks up a lot of movement as a Blink camera would before you adjust settings. Image quality is so/so in low light but during high sun the image quality is good. Main reasons for getting this new Blink product is to consolidate and move away from the other well known door bell company that I’m currently using but they want exorbitant fees for storage of clips per year. Also thefts have picked up in our neighborhood lately and these cameras are proving useful in identifying criminals as they roam and steal from our neighbors. I’ll keep you updated on the progress of the unit. I hope it works as good as the Blink Cameras.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2021"
3956,jonathan olson,"UPDATED: BATTERY KILLER better than off-brand, has compatibility issues with Echo and live view","  Well... first, the batteries died in less than a week, but to be fair, I didn't buy it through Amazon. I bought it at Target, so who knows how long they sat there in the box. UPDATE: Then I put in another pair of EXPENSIVE Lithium Ion AA's, and they only lasted a week as well. I have all settings on default so I don't get it. They boast that the batteries could last ""UP TO 2 YEARS""... and I am not even getting two darn weeks!I also bought a blink outdoor floodlight and 2 additional outdoor blink cameras. My suggestion is not to set up the doorbell before you set up the others. Unless you have a stand alone doorbell, then go for it. But the floodlight and additional cameras came with a sync module. And if you set up the doorbell first, and the sync module later, you have to delete the doorbell camera and go through the entire set up process again for it to sync. Wish I would have known that earlier. All in all though it was easy to get set up and working.I am still having issues with viewing any of the cameras live, through the blink app, the amazon mobile app, AND my Echo show. Amazon skills are just not up to par with the rest of the technology. I love that they are all wireless though. Being in an apartment, I can't be drilling holes all over the place and having power wires hanging around outside either. So for that I am happy they are easily installed.I am a little concerned about battery life, but we shall see! UPDATE: And so far I am seeing - this product is a battery hog. And it's NOT compatible with re-chargeables. so basically we're screwed if we dont hard wire it or have a way to hard wire it. For that I am not impressed.

Once latched, you need a tool to remove. It took me about 4 minutes to have this up and running.I am using this device with WiFi and the picture quality is good.

3958,Alisha Lee Rodriguez,INFURIATING !!!,"  Where to begin.  For starters......this system is NOT a system.  It rang up as 3 separate orders and SHIPPED in 3 separate orders !  WTH ?!?  I got the doorbell first.  The installation was infuriating.  Tells you how to install the batteries and install it, and then after you get the stupid thing installed .....the app tells you that you have to scan the QR code in order to pair the device with the app.  Where's the QR code....??  On the BACK of the doorbell that you just installed on your front door !!  GGRRrrrrr.  Nothing was simple or intuitive or correct on the first try.  The app is terrible.  The Blink doorbell will only display live view if it is hard wired.  (Not clear in description).  The motion detection was terrible.  Didn't work most of the time.  Then the other packages finally arrived (about a week later).  The first thing you're supposed to do it connect the Sync module.  Again.....instructions on how to install batters and plug in.....only to find out that you have to take it apart again in order to scan the QR code.....on the back.  Sync module would not connect to the network.  It seemed like it almost would once.....then nothing.  Just spinning wheel of doom forever.  Tells you to press the reset button on the Sync module.  What reset button ???  Had to look that one up online.  (It's a tiny pin hole on the side next to the USB connector.  No tool included for that one.)  Tried over and over and it still wouldn't connect.  (Without the Sync module BTW ....you lose most of the features of this system)  I didn't even get to the cameras honestly.

3959,José França Filho,Cheap and breaks way to easy!,  Save your money for a better product. This thing was nothing but crap. When ai installed the thing the little rubber seals on the back plate that keeps water out shredded to pieces. No big deal it is under a overhang and water is not going to get in it so I thought nothing of it. Then the free trial ends and you can not imagine how hard it is to find a way to subscribe so that you record videos and get notifications on your phone. The thing was useless for almost a week because their customer service never called me back as requested and it is darn near impossible to get them on the phone or to respond. Then after less than 2 months the batteries go dead. They advertise the battery life is 2 years! No way. So I go to replace the batteries using the tool they provide to open the thing. Mind you they give no instructions on how to open the thing and it was hard enough to get it mounted the first time. I was happy it was going to be a couple of years before having to touch it for 2 years. Well every one of the cheap plastic pegs that it mounts to on the back snapped right off. Had anyone just pulled a little on it the thing would have been gone in a quick second. I call them up and they refused to help me. They tell me take it back to where you bought it. What?

3961,Luis siqueiros,The Blink Doorbell Mount is Horrible!  Update!,"  Update!  I was impressed that Blink contacted me concerning the mount problem with their doorbell and actually sent me a replacement.  Unfortunately this doorbell has the same issues as the original.  Mounting the doorbell is very challenging and likely impossible for many people.  After watching the available video, yes there's a video, I was able to mount the doorbell to my home but it took many attempts and a lot of cursing!  On the flip side you'll have to detach the doorbell from the mount someday to change the battery.  Blink included a special tool for this but I've not been successful and I'm thinking that I'll end of breaking it.  So for now I have a working doorbell until the battery dies.I'm increasing my rating from one to two stars because once mounted, the Blink Doorbell does what it's supposed to do. Someone comes to my door and there's a notification on my phone.  Pressing the doorbell button provides a doorbell sound on my phone. I able to communicate back & forth with the person at my door from my phone.  I also like that the doorbell can activate my existing bell in my home. If you have a Blink system you may want to buy another sync module with the doorbell. That way you can have the doorbell always on without having to turn your cameras on.I do recommend waiting to buy the Blink Doorbell until the issue with the mount is resolved. I've been informed by Blink that it's going to addressed.

3962,Shirley Possehl,Activity zones don't work,"  I wanted to try this system because you don't need a subscription for basic things like detecting when packages are delivered.  The video is stored in a USB drive.  The setup is very easy and was quick.  Video quality is very good.  There are several good options and settings as well.But now the bad... the user is supposed to be able to set activity zones so that the system doesn't alert you every time a car or person passes by.  I set the zone so that it's only on my porch, so I can be alerted when the mailman or other delivery comes in or someone rings the doorbell.  Unfortunately, no matter what I did, it still detected every single car that passed by even though the street is completely removed from the detection zone, so I end up with numerous notifications and videos.  Now the app does say this feature is in Beta, but there's no way to know if this will ever get fixed.  I am returning the system because I don't want so many notifications showing me every car that passes by.I also wanted to point out what many others have, and that’s the mounting plate.  It’s fairly difficult to mount the camera on the mounting plate… bad design.  And one more thing… I would urge potential users to not believe the advertised 2 year battery life.  Two years on two AA batteries just won’t happen.  Maybe the manufacturer tested this device under ideal laboratory conditions that would never be duplicated in actual use.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2022"
3963,Evelyn Estrada,This camera is a pain in all areas. (I was given this set as a gift),"                    The media could not be loaded.
                




   Original review(around 11/16/21):So I’ve only had this for two weeks. It was a gift. Even with the low settings I’m already replacing the batteries. About a week in with the same settings it showed the batteries needed to be replaced. I replaced them with regular Duracell batteries to see if maybe there was a problem with the device or batteries. The Duracell lasted a few days before saying “replace”. I did realize after using the Duracell batteries that it needs to be Alkaline batteries. I then put the same energizer batteries back in and it was at 100% since that day(echo shows consumption). A week later they needed to be replaced.12/21/21 update: I was contacted by a Blink rep to try and figure out why I had to replace my batteries so soon(on 11/18). My camera IS always “armed” so it recorded “95,000 seconds as a total of motion detection and live view. The motion detection duration is about 95% of that 95,000 seconds”. My camera is on a slightly “busy” street, and I have a neighbor who’s a chain smoker and avid porch stander so the settings for sensitivity is low(4). But I was advised by the rep to set “privacy zones” which wouldn’t detect motion. In the videos you can see there’s NO motion(other than the small insects that fly near, which has never triggered the camera) and yet I’m still being alerted to movement. I’ve tried setting it to “end motion early” but it’ll literally end in the middle of someone passing or a car driving by. There has been times where I’ve refreshed the still photo and see a car behind me, but have no video of the car parking or leaving. I did remove a star because the problem still persists.12/26/21 update: as of today I have yet to receive a response to the several emails I’ve sent. As you can see in the video I have areas grayed out and I still received a notification for this “motion”. I’ve had to go back and forth on the settings because at a sensitivity of 3, I get NO notifications, but at 4 I get 400 notifications. I’ve also noticed if you set it to “end clip early if motion stops” someone can be walking past and the camera will pick up 3 seconds of it and end, even though they’re still walking in view of the camera. There can be someone standing right in front of the camera and I’ll get no notification. I also have notifications turned on on my phone(iPhone 11) and I’ll only see any notifications once I open the app. Not sure if that’s a blink issue or apple issue. Lastly, there are still times where the still is unable to refresh and I have to force close the app a couple times to get it to work.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2021"
3964,Randy Robinson,Very poor instructions and buggy software,"  I cannot rate Motion Detection, Night Vision, or Alexa Integration because I could not get my Blink Video Doorbell and Sync Module to work.There are very poor instructions. There's no overview, telling what does what and the sequence for creating your Blink network. Whoever developed the instructions should be fired. They're terrible (and only available online... too cheap to pay for printing?).So I went on YouTube and found help there. Unfortunately, while installing the physical doorbell seemed fairly straightforward, hooking the Sync Module up to my WiFi was anything but. After two frustrating hours, I finally gave up and boxed the whole mess up and sent it back to Amazon/Blink. Mind you, I have 1Gb WiFi throughout my home, with repeaters, so it wasn't a question of signal strength or bandwidth. I can run three laptops, a Sonos sound system, two smart TVs, several mobile devices, and more with no problem. FWIW, a couple of the YouTube reviewers were fairly critical of the Blink system, and the demos seemed to show a slow response to motion detection.Like so many websites these days, when you go to https://blinkforhome.com they try to sell you stuff, so you have to hunt for support. When you get there, they let you know they are super busy but go ahead and scroll through the FAQs and pray someone can answer your questions. Seriously?The system was a gift, so I will now shop for a video doorbell system that's highly rated and reasonably easy to install.

It worked fine for a couple weeks before it started acting up again. Wouldn't activate by motion when people came to the door. If the doorbell was pressed, it would act to wake it up & then it might connect. Even when connected, using Alexa as a chime speaker was nearly useless as the delay was HUGE.The Sync module was the worst. I got it along with 2 cameras and it worked for 24 hours before IT had issues. It couldn't be seen on the network by the app, so I attempted to reset it. It didn't work. I spent A MONTH with tech support, only to get nowhere. They REFUSED to offer a sync module replacement to see if there was a hardware problem. I was patient, polite, understanding. I'm an IT guy by trade, but they kept feeding me pretty terrible suggestions & wanted me to use RouteThis Helps.

3966,Monica Salas,Local storage and good motion detection,"  Pros:1. This device uses your homes existing doorbell chime instead of a wonky plug in chime like some other companies.2. The motion detection is very easily tunable3. This device can be added to a network of other cameras using the sync 2 module, and those cameras are also affordable and work as well as this doorbell cam does4. This device is both battery powered and wired capable, so you don't have to bother with deciding which one you need, because it does both.Cons:1. The doorbell is slow to load the feed when you first try to do a live view2. The recorded video will be interrupted if you try to view the feed after getting a motion detected notification with current firmware.3. The mount is a little floppy, I wish this item came with 4 screws instead of just the 2.Overall:This camera is great by itself, but it really shines when combined with the other camera options available through blink as an integrated system with the sync 2 module. Local storage is upgradable to a whopping 256gb USB stick which is fantastic. This is a great value for what you get.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2021"
3967,Alteris J. Candelario,Poor Quality and horrible without subscription,"  I bought this during Black Friday and really enjoy it initial. I enjoyed it because it had a nice picture quality during the day (however during the rise and set of the sun the picture coloring got wonky) , the free month trial of the blink subscription plan was nice - it marked the date and time of clips, it showed you a preview picture of what was captured, and if you had viewed the clip yet or not. However, I got the combo pack to save on the subscription price so I could save the videos locally and not pay a subscription. Ha should have known better - the videos almost never played from the model sync, no date or time on the clips, the quality was horrible, no preview picture, and sometime you’d click on a clip just to notice it was playing another clip all together. Not to mention the night quality (in a very well lit parking area) was horrible. They promote good battery life if you keep everything (length of clip, IR brightness and motion window) to a bare minimum.  This camera works really well with the subscription plan but without it storing your videos locally is horrible, the play back feature is the worst, night vision is super bad, battery life is bad, and it’s not worth the money.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2022"
3968,Sharon Ann Longo,Mounting sucks. Support says motion detection only works side to side.,"  Trying to mount this is a pita. I'm using the corner mount and either all of the little plastic tabs aren't locking in or mine is defective. It will just pull right off the mount with a light pull. I don't know how the ring or the g one mounts. maybe they all work like this? I'm afraid this might be stolen.I had to set the sensitivity to 4 in order for it to stop detecting headlights bouncing off my porch and setting off the motion detector. It was still detecting people walking to my door just fine.Then this morning around 6:30 USPS dropped off a big amazon box to me on my porch. It didn't even see them. :(I'm gonna play with the mounting and try to get it more secure / in a better position and see if that helps.Also setting it up was kinda finicky.  I had to delete from the app and reset the sync module and the camera after I tried adding it and it added but nothing would work.Also who ever was in charge of the setup tutorial in the app needs a few stars taken off them. It's not as clear as it should be. Sometimes you don't even know what to do next and have to guess.Also also, If you do the hard wire option and your chime isn't working, Make sure you actually did the installation hardwire option. If you don't select that option it doesn't send anything to the chime. It lets you pick your chime analog / digital and you can test out the sound. That part was pretty neat.Update:Remounted without the angle bracket. Changed sensitivity back to the default of 5. Reset my activity zones. Now it doesn't detect motion unless someone is about 3-4 feet from it.Just got off the phone with support. They said it only detects side to side movement and I should remount with the corner bracket.I'm gonna try changing the sensitivity to 6 and see if it makes a difference. If I have to change to the corner bracket, I'll probably just return it or give up and leave it where it is.You can see my zones setup in the photo with the ring pointed straight ahead. I feel like this is a pretty typical installation.Not sure if ring would work better or not.Update:Battery lasted a few days over a month I think. I thought they said 2 years?This thing was already a pain to mount. I don't want to be changing the batteries every month too.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2021"

I'm not sure why others are having issues as far as the one it don't work with 5G well mine does so maybe it's their internet provider or something else? So far I like mine. If this jinx's it I'll be back to report. I see on here those who had the common sense to contact Blink CS and as for wireless vs not wireless all I can tell you is what an I.T told me. There is nothing totally wireless even your cell phone depends on an electric source to recharge. ( Yes a car battery is considered an electrical source!) I think the problem most are having are as with myself this is not for the novice. That's why my son in law set it up for me ? I find as I age it's the simple things that become difficult. So my review for now is I love my Blink ! I can see and hear whose at my door very good when you are alone. Also gives you time to prepare in case it's someone trying to break in.

3970,Amazon Customer,You get what you pay for,"  This is a terrible video doorbell.  I own several rental properties and have video doorbells at each one.  In other words, I am fairly familiar with the other ones on the market.  I decided to try the Blink when the one I wanted was out of stock and it’s a total disappointment.  First of all, the picture quality is terrible.  Secondly the app is extremely show so when you finally do see the camera, it’s too late.  Also it has a super annoying feature where if you are viewing the surveillance live, it makes you press “Continue” every 15 seconds in order to keep watching.  I am returning it and honestly would not pay $1 for the Blink because it defeats the purpose of even having a video doorbell due to its terrible picture quality and it’s slow speed.  It amazes me that this product could have such positive reviews.  It’s interesting how the products make by Amazon-owned companies seem to always have stellar reviews.  Amazon has changed in so many ways over the past three years that it doesn’t even seem like the same company anymore.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2022"
3971,edward k.,Long time coming but not right yet,"  Been waiting to add-on the Blink doorbell cam for years. After already having the Blink system with 5 ourdoor cameras  I figured the new doorbell cam would be a slam-dunk. Sadly, I'm  very disappointed.  While the camera sync'd to the system easy enough it was the mounting  being totally flawed. I've read other reviews noting flat surface necessity so using the corner mount should render this point moot. I even tried to get the backplate to hold without even mounting it, no go  The issue is the flimsy back plate, slide-tabs, gasket and bottom locking clip. WHAT A STUPID DEDIGN!  It would have been much better to use larger internal slide-tabs and a small locking set screw on the bottom. As for the gasket, it sticks and needs lubricated in order to slide the two pieces together. All-in-all this is huge design flaw, if possible wait for Rev.2...I wish I had.  I  don't know why Blink didn't use Ring's doorbell housing and just swap out the guts. That would've been much smarter. It shouldn't be that hard to design a simple/secure mounting. BTW: Blink customer sevice is sending me a new backplate but I  doubt if it will make much difference.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2021"
3972,malinda,Nice addition to Blink ecosystem,"  The Blink doorbell is a nice addition to their other cameras. The look and feel of the camera is pretty good. They designed it to be a quick and easy install. At first, sliding the camera onto the base can be challenging, but if you follow the gif example on how to attach it and firmly slide it down, you’ll find that the camera is securely attached.

3973,malinda,Updated original review…go with a more established doorbell,"  Old review at bottom. Update: Blink service ran a diagnostic in the doorbell and reported a hardware issue. They sent me another one. So, the first one would detect motion…all the time! When I thought I had it tuned in, it started going off all the time again. But, it would also not detect something right in front of it quite a bit. The video to audio lag was ridiculous. So, maybe this new one would be different. Nope, doesn’t detect any motion. I have done all the trouble shooting and nothing. Getting to support through the app is a hassle too. It want to take you to a you type, we predict thing. If you select “contact support” again, it just takes back through the whole type your question here. So, they reached out to me after the first issues (both through support and a rep who saw my review) so kudos to that. However, it’s not a reliable doorbell. Poor backplate design, poor battery life, a difficult to navigate app that doesn’t seem to match to online help directions, lack luster and unreliable motion detection, terrible lag (and weird digital noises), videos are supposed to be 10s long but only went for 2-3 (settings for cut early were disabled). I wish I had jus spent the extra money for a doorbell that’s been around a bit longer.Previous review: Well, batteries last about three months them dead. I have gotten it adjusted to just go off when people approach so hopefully it would last longer. Ok, so now I change the batteries. Use the key and go to slide and all but one tab snapped off.

It was a pain to lock the doorbell onto the back plate but after trying a few times I finally figured it out. I love that it works with my existing chime. The video quality is great too! I also like that it’s basically like my other blink cameras with those same features like live view, recording motion, blocking areas like bushes so it doesn’t give false alarms, and you don’t have to have a monthly subscription. The only thing I wish I could change is the sound the actual doorbell makes when it’s pressed. Hopefully that’ll come in the future.

Every set of Energized lithiums that I buy now (multiple packs, same as supplied with doorbell) last 4-5 DAYS.Second major problem, when the batteries are dead, even with the hardwired doorbell, THE DOORBELL DOESN'T RING.  It's a switch, that shouldn't need batteries to power the camera in the first place, and sure as heck shouldn't need batteries to close the connection to ring the doorbell that is POWERED FROM THE HOUSE.The only saving grace for this thing is the notifications and two-way audio.

   I have been with Blink for a long time, I have four minis, two outdoor XTs, and I am grandfathered in to the free monthly cloud storage, etc…I have been reading some of the reviews, and a lot of people have returned this because of the difficulty mounting the back plate. I will admit it wasn’t super easy, but it wasn’t difficult either.Other than that, the sync module was a little difficult to set up. I tried to set it up with my phone and no matter what I did I kept getting an error message that the password was incorrect. I ended up using my wife’s phone (we both have the same phone, on the same version of iOS, logged into the same account) and it worked the first time. Go figure. I don’t use a VPN or anything either.Other than that, installation was very easy. I wired it to my homes existing doorbell power and it rings my chime box just fine. I didn’t notice the motion detection isn’t nearly as good as it is on the outdoor XT camera, which I left up at the front door as well. My XT camera will notify me of motion, and there will be someone standing at my front door, but for some reason the doorbell does not pick up the motion.

My front door being about 10 feet from a busy street the batteries last about 3 days before dying. My only option was to turn the sensitivity down so low that it was useless as a camera unless pressed. After about a week it, the doorbell completely failed. Tried an entire pack of batteries and couldn't get it to work. Contacted blinks excellent support and said their was a hardware issue and they would send me a new one and I sent the old one back.

I wanted to replace the existing wired doorbell and use with existing chime (Nutone KB-10.) The existing chime/doorbell was wired to a 12vac transformer in the basement that also powered the whole house humidifier. I connected the Blink and attached the back without mounting to the door frame for testing purposes  (BTW that wasn't trivial.)  When pressed the app would alert, the doorbell itself would chime once, but the wired chime would not chime. Repeat press nothing happens. Apparently the transformer output needs to be between 16v and 24v. If the voltage is less than 16v the door bell goes into some sort of ""event mode"" and becomes partially functional. Replacing the transformer with a compliant one is not worth the expense, effort and time. I'm returning.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2021"

It would initially work then quit. I tried resetting the doorbell (three times), logging in/out (three times also), re-installing the app.  Nothing worked.2) The motion setting would kickoff a video recording whenever a car drove by even with the sensitivity set to the lowest.

It was very easy to install and setup the video door bell.Now the down side of the version that I got, I bought the white doorbell version to match my exterior trim or our house. I ended up needing the corner mounting bracket due to the location of where my old door bell was located at on the entry door frame.  The mounting bracket is black (you would think they would send a matching color mounting bracket).  I don’t like the zebra look of the black and white, and I ended up painting the mounting bracket white to match the color of the door frame trim and doorbell.The other issue I have with the blink products (doorbells and cameras) is the hardware that is shipped with them, they are subpar.  The heads of the screws strip while turning the screws making them useless to use, (and that is installing them with predrilled pilot holes). I have always replaced them with higher quality screws when installing the cameras due to this issue, it is frustrating.Overall with the 2 annoying issues noted above, I would still highly recommend this product.

3997,joe lenz,Mounting should be easier!!! Mounting update.,"  Received as a gift. All good for a camera doorbell. Connected to our existing ringer, easy enough. Who designed the mount? This should be WAY easier to get the camera to attach to the mount and still have the security. Tiny tabs and unless this is on a completely flat surface (what siding or door frame is?), the mount is very difficult to attach to the camera part. Please make this better on the next version. The ring app is way better but for what it is, the blink app is okay.Update to this review.Was contacted by customer service after this review was posted and they offered me an upgrade to the mount. The new mount has a much more sturdy plate in Mount easily to an uneven surface. The tiny tabs are still difficult to get situated but it can be mounted on an uneven surface. I feel like this plate should not be an upgrade but should be the standard.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2022"
3998,chenda,Amazon is selling convenience for $10/ month with Blink Cameras,"  As you can see from the photos, once your trial ends, thats when the real problems begin. For one the live video recording is no longer a feature only viewing live feed is an option. Second, once you only have a USB stick instead of cloud, then all videos move onto the ' Home Security' tab. Here is where the headaches begin.One, you can't delete mass footage, only one by one, however the Cloud tab has this option. Two, you cant see the thumbnails of each video, so if you are trying to build a timeline of strangers walking outside your house, goodluck going back and forth. Three, when you decide to delete a video somewhere further down the list, it will reset to the most recent video, and finding where you left off is near impossible when you have a lot of footage because THE THUMBNAILS ARE GONE.Its like Amazon is forcing people to pay for simple time savers. I've never felt more scammed in my life. I Bought three cameras plus the doorbell camera and I now definitely don't even feel like using it anymore. THess cameras are not user friendly after the trial ends. I already pay for prime every month. Why the hell would i pay another $10 a month for simple features?? Honestly the 60 day cloud storage is not needed, AMAZON IS ONLY SELLING CONVENIENCE FOR $10 A MONTH.DO NOT BUY THESE CAMERAS, SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO WITH ANOTHER OPTION LIKE ARLO.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2021"

4000,Hyunkyung Ahn,Difficult and Frustrating to Install,"  I have 5 Blink cameras that I installed with no trouble. I saw the Blink doorbell was available and was very interested. I was disappointed because my doorbell got stuck in transit and took a long time to receive. I installed the doorbell yesterday and it was very frustrating. Come on Blink it shouldn't be this hard to install a video doorbell. I struggled for a few hours trying to get the doorbell on the mount. I was ready to give up and my neighbor came out and helped me secure it to the mount. However, what am I going to do when I have to change the batteries? I hope it doesn't take hours to put back up. I wanted to order another doorbell but I think I will wait, in case and hopefully, improvements are made. I like the quality of the camera but the installation is awful. Don't know if I would recommend to my family and neighbors, until improvements are made. Many of my neighbors have Blink cameras. The doorbell should be as easy as the camera to install.

Its advertised as its not needed to be wired for live video feed but when using the batteries all you are able to see is the still pictures of the movement.

4004,Isiahs,Updated review. Was looking forward to seeing how this would work and was very disappointed.,  **Update to my original one star review. After writing a poor review I was surprised to receive an email the next day from Haitham. He apologized for the issues and frustration I experienced as well as for the time I had spent trying unsuccessfully to install the doorbell. He offered to send me a new one at no charge to try in case the one I had was defective. He was very helpful and seemed to genuinely care about fixing the problem. I was impressed to see a company go out of their way to make sure a customer was happy. It’s rare these days for any company to care about their customers or consumers. I will wait and see how the new doorbell works out and I will update my review assuming my experience is better but for now I am impressed by the way they have tried to correct the issue.** My mom ordered this because she is home alone a lot of the time and wanted to know when someone was at the door and who it was before opening the door. I consider myself to be pretty tech savvy and I can usually figure out a solution to an issue with most things. I have installed other cameras inside and outside of her home that have worked great with few to no issues. I assumed this doorbell would be the same and I was sorely mistaken. After following all of the instructions step by step i wired it to her existing wires for her doorbell and could not get it to work and chime like a normal doorbell. I tested the voltage and it tested exactly where it needed to be but still nothing. I thought maybe it was defective so I planned on just using it with the batteries until I could get a new one. I have to say that whoever engineered the mounting plate for this is under qualified to say the least. I mounted the bracket as flat as it could possibly be and no matter how hard I tried I couldn’t get it to click into place. I adjusted it and tweaked it for over an hour after reading some of the reviews I read several that said it takes an extreme amount of pressure as well as just the right angle as you are pushing it on to get it attached correctly so I tried again and of course the cleats that hold it in place broke. Luckily I was able to find another bracket on an online marketplace for cheap so I bought it and went through the process all over again only for it to break again. I’ve been an Amazon customer for as long as it’s been around and I’ve never left a negative review on anything but I feel like this is something that needs to be said so other people don’t buy it thinking it’s just a simple 10 minute install. There are major design flaws in with this that I really hope they can work out. It’s a very affordable and from the ones that I’ve seen that they were able to get them installed and working correctly they look like it’s exactly as they are promoted but unfortunately for me that was not the experience I had. I’m considering just buying another one to try it and see if I have better luck. I hope I do but if not I will have no choice but to go with RING. I hope anyone that buys one has a better experience than I did and for those who have one that functions the way it’s supposed to you should consider yourself lucky. I hope more R &D goes into this that will remedy the flaws.

After you mount the plate for the doorbell (and wires to the chime if desired)  carefully line up the doorbell and push hard to the surface then tap it down with the end of your screwdriver or similar.  Not too hard or you'll break it.  The same is true if you push down too hard. It has to go in AND down to lock the cover on.  Don't try to remove without the special tool if you need to or you'll break it.  2.  As for the camera mounts once you have the stand mounted and remove the rubber cover exposing the cover screw, you have to line it up and use a good amount of force to get it to catch.

4225,1john,Disappointing,"  I got this to replace my Nest doorbell camera as I thought it would work better with Alexa. But it has a lot of problems. The video quality is poor and the sunlight really blows out the image. I could not get the camera to steam to more than one device (Alexa Echo show and iphone for example) at the same time. The second device would not connect and just gave an error message. Had to take extra steps to connect through blink. Amazon owns blink, why can't I just use it directly? This should all be part of the alexa app. I was expecting that if someone rings the doorbell the video would be displayed on my alexa devices automatically. It does not. It does not appear you can save footage to both the cloud and the sync 2 module at the same time. I don't see an option to schedule quiet time to prevent the doorbell from ringing (like at night or for example if you have a sleeping baby.) Also, the max drive capacity you can use on the sync 2 module is 256 gb, and if you try to use a larger drive it ignores the drive entirely. The volume on the speaker is also too low. Sadly the nest doorbell cam (first generation) might be hanging around a bit longer.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2021"
4226,Robert,Great price.  Terrible performance .,"  I purchased 2 of these prior to launch. Let me just start by saying that I am in no way new to the Blink eco system . I was an early adopter way back when they launched on kickstarter in 2014 and I own multiples of every single generation . So I am fully aware of the hardware and software limitations and work arounds. For this  doorbell : the positive ? 1) Price 2) speaker volume. Cons ? 1) The mounting system design and materials . All of it is made of very cheap plastic. Even the mounting involves  very thin brittle plastic tabs that offer no positive click when installed . The “ key “ to secure  it to its base is a joke . It just pries a  thin plastic latch off of a plastic nub.  There is no doubt that in 1 year when it comes time to replace the batteries … all the plastic tabs will now be brittle from uv and break !( I was afraid I’d break them on day one ! ) the worst ?  The amount of false alarms from motion are incredible . No matter how you adjust the sensitivity and the zones … every time a car drives by and the sun reflects off the car … bam “ someone is at the door “ ! This is an issue with every single generation of BIink cameras . But at least with the xt,xt2 and outdoor you can try and angle it and point the camera away from trouble areas and minimize false alerts . With this one - by the time you adjust the sensitivity to reduce false alerts … you then won’t set it off until you are within a couple of feet . Ring ( the amazon company that gets all its  love and attention ) is way way better at reducing false alarms . It can be done. So in the end - turn off motion alerts completely  - they are not worth the 10-20 false alerts a day ! And plan on this being a disposable product when you break it in a year or so trying to change the batteries ! Blink : At least put some metal reinforcing to the “ key “ area on the bottom . A couple of years after announcing this product … and this is what’s unveiled ? Yawn ! Let’s hope That Amazons “ step child “ gets some Ring software developers to refine what very well could have become the best value in doorbells . At this time however, if you live on a busy street or less than 100 feet from a road … prepare to be annoyed !",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2021"
4227,Jessica,Worse doorbell than the RING sadly.,"  I had the ring doorbell for a few years and started to wonder if the blink might be better. So, I bought a blink doorbell. I have 8 blink cameras already so I assumed this would be a good product.Sadly, it's WORSE than the ring in many aspects... too many. 1. there's no chime to plug in to an outlet so your whole house can hear the doorbell ringing. They say that it works with alexa (if you have those products) and will ring on echos and dots in your home. Well, that's great but what if you don't have alexa OR can't get the blink to work with alexa? I can't get blink to work with any of my 6-8 shows, echos and dots. So, the only place I hear it ring is on my phone. What if I'm not near my phone?2. It rang recently on my phone and I tried to talk to the person at my door. He could hear me but I couldn't hear him. So annoying.3. The cover is really hard to remove to charge the battery.4. My neighbor rang the bell and looked right into the camera. I'm watching him (during the daytime) on my phone and can't even tell it is him! The camera quality is terrible.5. Doesn't work when wifi goes out.I'm so glad my 1972 home still has it's ancient wired 12v doorbell. It's original to the home and always worked and always will work. Technology can be too frustrating to be worth the hassle. I believe in the case of the blink and the ring doorbells, this is true. If someone rings my bell and I don't answer, they can come back or leave the package or do whatever. I don't need to talk to them while they're standing there and I'm likely busy driving or doing something more important than worrying about someone who is at my door.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2021"
4228,Jessica,Excellent deterrent for porch pirates.,"  We’ve had some porch pirates in our neighborhood steal packages from right in front of our door. We ask around and found people with video doorbells had less incidents like this. Heck, even if this didn’t work it would still be an excellent deterrent.The picture quality is excellent, and the set up is not bad either. I already had a sync module 2 so it seamlessly integrated with my other cameras by simply scanning the QR code. It comes with two AA lithium batteries which is awesome. Batteries last a long time in all my Blink devices.Love the Alexa integration with my Echo Show and Fire TV. It does take a few seconds to switch over to the camera, but otherwise it works perfectly.Hallway lights in our apartment building are on 24/7 so I haven’t had the opportunity to test the night vision. My 2 blink outdoor cameras are outside and the night vision is excellent.The plastic bracket  is a little tricky to attach. I’m assuming it has to be very tight and login to keep a weather seal around the inside. Don’t be afraid to give it a little bit of force. Push it in and up and it will lock in. I didn’t screw it into the door frame because I’m in an apartment and we’re not allowed to do that. We used some Alien Tape and it’s holding up there wonderfully.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 13, 2021"
4229,StevePresley,"Very good, but maybe a showstopper issue","  I won't go into a long description of features because you can find that elsewhere.Instalation was smooth and my current system read the qr code, added the doorbell camera, and updated the firmware as normal.Here's the showstopper that may lead to a return.  The doorbell camera cannot be put of a separate schedule from the rest of the system.  I have 4 other Blink cameras covering the property.  The system arms at 10pm and disarms at 7.  I would like the doorbell to be on all the time.  It can't do it.  I called tech support and they said there was some kind of a kludge to do it but it wouldn't work very well and he said they have no plans to ever give the doorbell independent functionality.  If you want that, you have to buy the Ring doorbell, also owned by A, and that's the reason to buy the higher priced product.All that being said, the Blink doorbell may be for you if you keep your whole system armed all the time or if it's the only security camera you need, perhaps for an apartment or condo application where you're not covering a larger property.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2021"
4230,DogProblems,Doorbell works lag time for camera is too long,"  Doorbell works.  Lag time for camera is too long, like 10 seconds!!! That’s outrageous. I moved the the sync module2 to a position just on the other side of the wall from the doorbell and even moved my router to about 15 feet from the sync module. I hooked it up to my existing doorbell wiring and set up the app to ring my existing doorbell as well as the echo dot and on my iphone. That all works great. Camera is useless unless you just want to record an intruder braking down you door. The police could use it for evidence after the fact but you would know anything except someone is at the door just like before I had this piece of trash. It is less expensive than one that actually works but if your going to hook one up it will save you lots of aggravation to fork out a few more bucks and get Amazons other doorbell and pay the $30 dollar yearly subscription and it works great from what I hear.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2021"
4231,Streetmitch,Limited Use without a Contract,"  This has very limited use over a regular doorbell. If you can’t get to your door, you can look on your camera and talk with whoever might be at your door. However, there is a delay between when the doorbell rings and the link notifies you on your phone.The live view will show you what a package looks like if it’s been delivered to your door, but typically Amazon will send you an email with the same information. And, unless you purchase another little piece of plastic to put behind the doorbell, you may not even be able to see the package anyway. This is the kind of thing that should’ve been included with the unit from the beginning.Finally, as a security device it is only useful if you purchase a contract so that whatever happens is recorded and you can view it later. I would’ve liked to see some minimal recording available without purchasing an additional contract.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2022"
4232,Dan Steely,Waited to buy video doorbell - Blink for Home is a awesome video doorbell,"  When everyone was introduced to the Ring doorbell, the cost kept me from purchasing one. When the Blink for Home doorbell came out I preordered one.  Once Amazon was ready to ship, the doorbell came within 2 days. At first, I was concerned, being nearly 70 years old and in poor health, about being able to install it properly.  After watching the video and following the step by step instructions, I had the Blink doorbells installed and working in minutes.  This was the easiest Wi-Fi device setup I’ve ever attempted.Once I had the doorbell installed I was impressed with the quality of the picture/video being sent to my tablet and smartphones.  I’ve shown my wife how to view the images on her phone and tablet. She now is happy we’ve have this device. This is a product I will tell all our friends about, encouraging them to look into.

   I agree with just about every other review, for basic home doorbell detection this thing is jam up for the price. however installation was miserable and unless you're somebody that likes to read all instructions from top to bottom 1st, you'll find yourself taking it back apart. You have to scan the little QR Code on the doorbell with the app to link the device to your app prior to installing it onto your home.. I found this to be absolutely stupid but that's just me.  It does not slide on and click into place very easily probably because the brackets on it's wall mount are shallow; so part of me also thinks that a really good wind could knock this device off of my house.  However for a basic, intro home protection device I think it's well worth the money.  Video quality is pretty great and the sound on the video from outside is great. However using the feature to talk from your app to the device is trash. So far no one that I've tried to use this feature with has been able to understand what I am saying to them, through the doorbell. I can actually hear the electronic garble And feedback on the video once the recording stops.

4310,Amazon Customer,Cameras aren't sensitive enough to catch thief. Amazon no longer stores deleted videos,"  I just got off the phone with Blink, because I needed to retrieve an accidentally erased video. They will no longer restore deleted videos. I was told that even if the Police or the FBI needed it, and the customer approved, they will not restore it for any reason whatsoever.My reason for a 2 out of 5 stars:1a) The camera won't record someone pulling a CAR into my driveway, but will record a car going by on the street beyond my driveway. Not a joke. No matter the sensitivity settings, even if I block off the street, it will still oftentimes record the street traffic. Heck, it oftentimes records people taking walks on the sidewalk ACROSS THE STREET!  But not a 5,000 lb vehicle in the center of my driveway, which is in the center of the camera view (brand new, clean lens camera BTW).1b) I set up MULTIPLE cameras at a friends house, and no matter what, if a person walks into the camera view from around the side of the house, the cameras will NOT pick up the person walking, until about 5 seconds into their walk. By then, literally, they can EASILY slipped into the back sliding glass door being undetected by the camera. If anyone wants proof of this, I will HAPPILY go to the friend's home and record with my iPhone the entire scene, and then upload the Blink videos, along with the iPhone videos so you can compare. We actually were able to get a person into the home undetected by TWO Blink cameras. (and yes, sensitivity was even tested on HIGH many times)SOLUTION: If Blink can make areas in the field of view less sensitive, they should be able to do the opposite, and hyper-sensitize areas that are most important to the owners.2) No retrieval of deleted videos. THE SOLUTION: Every Blink owner from this point out, should never delete another video EVER. They won't charge you for it, because it is unlimited storage!  So just let it stack up, and if you ever need to go back, it'll be there for you!  It's a pain to erase a few hundred videos every few days, so why not just leave it there! Amazon will have billions of videos they're going to have to store as a result, and maybe then, they'll allow you to retrieve something deleted to get people to start deleting again.3) If you want to have a conversation with someone at your door through the blink camera and your iPhone (WHILE YOU ARE ACTUALLY IN THE HOME ON THE SAME WIFI), it sounds like you are thousands of miles away, because of the delay. Can't think of a better way to make someone think you aren't home!I do like the Blink system when it came to ease of install. The app is fairly easy to use as well. But they do have some serious issues to correct. Hoping Blink/Amazon will put a team on it and get these issues addressed.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2021"

4331,Mariek,Hardware is great; app could use some work,"  I’ve had blink outdoor cameras for years, and decided to add a blink doorbell when my old Ring was retired. The video quality is great, motion activation is accurate, and the doorbell was very easy to install. My one complaint: How notifications work in the blink app. Notifications are all or nothing—you can’t turn notifications on or off by camera and still have it record motion. So in order for me to be notified when someone rings the doorbell, I have to sit through 500+ notifications a day from the outdoor cameras that my dogs are running through the backyard. It would be wonderful if Amazon could add a simple feature where we can set cameras recording and turn off notifications per camera.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2022"

I've had this a few months, I get 20+ notifications a day about someone walking past, I have still yet to click the notification and be taken to a live view. Every time I do I get a timeout message telling me I'm not able to do live view anymore.This paired with the fact I had to buy a MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION JUST TO USE THE THING, nah this is garbage. I order enough packages to know for a fact this piece of junk doesn't even notify you half the time when someone is at the door.I'm assuming all of my issues are because I didn't hard wire it.

4355,AT,Love,"  It’s great! There is a subscription, but I think it’s only like $1-$2. It senses motion nicely. Night vision is great too! You can make it chime really loud too. This is handy if you have a smaller place and don’t want to buy to extra sync plug in!! It is also very sturdy. You might feel like you’re gonna break it when you have to put/replace the batteries, but you won’t. It’s just to make it harder for people to remove from your door without permission. You’ve gotta be rough on purpose! If you want to use batteries it works just as well! But be prepared to change the batteries often. Depending on how often mine record I change them every 2-3 weeks. Worth it not to deal with wiring it in to me. One of the main selling points for me. It also has all features of the ring doorbell on the basic plan, EXCEPT being able to view live feed at any time. You can only view live by clicking on your push notification within 60 seconds. To me this is fine, usually if I don’t get there in 60 seconds the person is gone anyways.

I was able to get the sync module connected fairly easily and then the doorbell connected to the module fairly easily. Immediately upon opening the app and clicking on the camera icon I started getting failure messages saying camera was busy or thumbnail failed. So of course I called customer support and I was on the phone with him for honestly over 3 hours. And of course they walked me through every ridiculously basic troubleshooting step regardless of if I had already tried it or not. Every troubleshooting step was  focused on my network, I'm a professional field instrumentation engineer, so I'm fairly competent installing a video doorbell LOL their troubleshooting steps were almost insulting . There's definitely nothing wrong with my network and I explained that every other device connects to it just fine... I even had to download an app so they could test my network up and down speeds. After all that I was finally transferred to a higher customer service level where the man told me he saw several problems in their server. By this time it was nearly 11:00 p.m. so I got off the phone, assuming he would at least clear the flags he saw on their network . Apparently he didn't because it's still not even remotely functional.... this was just an overall bad experience.Occasionally I'm able to see a live view or 2 but it never records anything, the video quality is crap, I get 30 plus false person/movement detected notifications a day, I didn't get a notification when Amazon delivered my order, and I am unable to set motion zones, lol. I would much rather have a first generation ring doorbell which is honestly a pretty terrible device. In fact I've had two of those and neither of them have lasted more than 3 months.

4365,Anthony,Poor Operation Quality,"  Can't endorse the Blink Video Doorbell with a Sync 2 Module. I have other Blink cameras (outdoor, indoor and minis) on a Sync 2 module that are battery or electric powered. Those work great! The Doorbell is a completely different experience. The batteries have only lasted 2 months. First time the batteries failed I called customer service and had them replaced. Two months later, the replacement set has failed. I do understand that the settings used in the app, as well as number of trigger events, can affect battery life which I dialed back some with the second set of batteries.Operationally it has not performed to my expectations. There is a delay in triggering to record which sometimes fails to capture me pulling in the driveway nor walking up the sidewalk. We have had deliveries and it doesn't start recording until the driver is walking away from the door and halfway down the driveway. Other times it records fine. I do understand that there is a delay (20 sec) from one trigger event to the next but this is not the cause. Did get a cool picture of a bee checking out the camera (daytime, a bit blurry).Then other times it will start triggering when there has been nothing to cause a trigger. I also notice the recordings in this case are much slower speed than a regular recording. I called customer service and was told that the camera is constantly connecting and disconnecting from wifi. Hmm...the sync module is approximately 6' from the doorbell and the router another 10'. Our other Blink cameras and sync module are approximately 20' from the sync module and 25' plus a different level from the same router. These cameras have no problems.I've also had problems with the doorbell notification sound coming to my Android phone. The notification arrives fairly promptly. The sound is inconsistent. When the button is pushed, sometimes it will chime on my phone and other times it won't chime on my phone even though I have received the notification message. When it does chime, it is quite loud on the doorbell and my phone.Picture quality during the day is excellent. Night time, even with the IR turned down, is grainy.I just find that the Doorbell is too inconsistent for our use.  It entirely may be our set up/logistics somehow that is not ideal for the doorbell and may work more reliably in another setting. I really wanted it to work but after three calls to customer service and no resolution; I just give up. Our other cameras are great and will keep using them. Our other wifi devices work well also.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2022"

(Not ideal but it works).I love the app and the reasonable enough subscription price.Easy to save videos if needed.You can chose which parts of the view are ‘active’ so if for instance you don’t want the camera to start recording everything in its peripheral scope (like a busy street), you can simply unselect it.You can purchase additional blink cameras and monitor all from one app.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2022"
4385,Charlotte Rr,No auto live view like ring has and EXTREMELY slow to show manual live view which makes it USELESS!!,"  So, I am a tech type dude so I thought it would be awesome to have a video doorbell that shows me whos at the door when the doorbell rings and I or my wife could talk to them in real time while sitting on our asses, too lazy to get up and look through the peephole like we have for decades. I bought this thing and bought an Echo Show so I figured it was all good. Well, let me just say that YES , when the doorbell rings , the Echo Show tells me someones at the door, but NO, it does NOT support showing you the front door unless you then TELL it to. There APPARENTLY is no way around this according to everything I have read and tried but THATS NOT ALL FOLKS.... the response time between issuing the ""Hey Alexa, show me the front door"" command and actually getting to SEE the front door averages between 15 seconds and 1 minute. The same problem exists when you use a mobile device and click on ""Live View"" whether you are at home or somewhere else. LAME.  Now, I have already done ALL the usual stuff we do when something tech-like doesnt work as expected such as resettting, moving the wireless equipment etc and my home network is FLAWLESS with brand new router, modem etc and 300mbs internet, all with great wifi signal throughout the house. For what I paid for this crap, I expected more. My mistake. For the record, I looked at how my friends comparable RING setup worked for him, and NONE of these issues exist.

And that was a problem.We got them activated, then it took a little while before we could get them installed.  I think we missed our 2 week free trial entirely.  But, it takes a while to get things done while unpacking.The day we put them up, we lost internet for 3 days.  They don't work without internet.Finally, we had them up and running.They are S L O W  .... I watched the mailman ring the doorbell ... set down the packages ... and leave.  As the truck was driving away, my phone chimed ... about 20 seconds.My son has enjoyed them.  He can talk with me from the garage door or front door.  I can open the Blink app to watch the live video.  My husband even gets the doorbell while he is driving around town.Maybe we need to get the services that go with these ... I didn't think about extra monthly charges when I ordered them.... service is by Blink, a company of Amazon.My ""Show"" doesn't seem to be able to connect to the devices .. one of the big reasons that we chose Blink doorbells is so we could see them from our Show devices.Overall, not impressed.I've never gotten the motion detection to work.

4462,Christian Mendoza,Clear picture,"  ***UPDATE*** I read reviews that mentioned a 10-second delay. This is true. I can my neighbors coming & going. There's a delay from the time motion is detected to the time you get a notification on your phone. You can't tap in to live feed right away - there's another delay. Once your free trial ends, so does the recording and with the delay to tap into live feed so does any chance of seeing something when it first happens.Arrived on time. It was easy to install. I didn't get the Module to go with it but I might get it in the future. Picture quality is great. I don't understand why the doorbell sound on the device is so loud. I wish I could turn it down.

Had I known about the  unnecessary  limits to the motion event recordings I would have spent the extra money and bought a ring doorbell. And I’m not the only one that has this opinion and has had this feature mess up recordings during real life security events like a burglary. If you want a camera you can use to verify when mail, packages, or guests arrive it would work fine. But I would not advise Blink systems be used for security purposes.

   I was really needing a doorbell with camera and at the moment I couldn't afford a super expensive one but I still wanted the security in my home and I decided to purchase this one since it had good reviews and it was at an awesome price, I really do like even though I would change a few things I really can't complain just because of what I paid for it I feel like o got way more than what I expected. The day vision on this thing is awesome its super clear and so is the the sound as you can see in the video, but the night vision is horrible, you can't really see anything unless the person is standing right in front of the camera or you can get a way better vision if you have lights on outside, the one thing I have problems with is that my house doesn't have a chime pre installed and I can't just add one like you can with the ring doorbell so that sucks because I really need one, on the plus side I can connect the doorbell to my echo devices to be alerted when someone is at the door, the other thing I dont like is that the video and sound are about 5 seconds off so when someone is near the doorbell they will be closer to the door than you think and that's what I dont like that people are actually able to get to my door way before the blink notifies me and when I talk to someone through the app I have to wait to hear what they are telling me. I will still continue to try this item out since lately the sensor has trouble getting triggered when someone aproches my door and it doesn't notify me or it doesn't start recording until its a little too late, the battery life is awesome it really does last a very long time and the doorbell is very easy to install as well as the app its also very easy to use.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2022"

4626,Cosmo,it was bought for alexa and the integration is terrible. It works OK for the blink application.,"  I had experience in cameras installation (3 from different manufacturers and all are working well but not integrated with Alexa). This Blink camera was bought as a present for an elder friend for direct integration with Alexa. Installation of the Blink software was easy and the camera worked well. Connection with the Alexa was also easy, and my problems started: after some time of inactivity (10 minutes or so) Alexa loses the camera. I reinstalled that couple of times with the same result. Because it is a present I changed the camera to another one and reinstalled everything from zero point... with a similar result: it stops working after 10-15 minutes of inactivity, i.e. it doesn't send any signal to Alexa after the button was pressed and ring bell played. The motion detection regime actually helps - Alexa loses the camera after hours not minutes))) Everything - motion and ring bell - is well reflectd in the Bell application, so the problem is certainly in the integration with Alexa. The worst issue is that to make the system alive one must delete the camera and reinstall it again (btw, the suggestion came from my communication with the online service), which is hard (almost impossible) for the person I made this present to. So, I am very disappointed by this product and do not recommend it for integration with Alexa - I wasted hours to make the system work and failed )",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2022"
4627,chiapetdog,LOVE IT,"  Yesterday I had my fourth Porch Pirate incident.Today I have a Blink video doorbell.It took my daughter and me about 20 minutes to install it. That included unboxing, downloading the app, working our way through the app, trying to locate an electric screwdriver, the whole nine yards.Hot Tip for Connecting It: At first, the doorbell wouldn't slide onto the plate. Then I got in there and really forced the screws connecting the plate to the doorframe those final few millimeters. Then it worked just fine.And it you're wondering if it can easily be stolen: Yes and No. Yes if someone wants to come along with a hammer or crowbar and rip the whole thing off of the wall. No if they just want to grab and go. Once you fix it to the plate, you need a special small key to get it back off. Don't lose that!The doorbell feature worked instantly. We had to poke around in the app to get the motion detection to work. That's the part I'm actually interested in. I figure the video doorbell itself is the single biggest deterrent to more thefts, but actually getting someone on camera if they do steal something? Golden.The motion detector has been in overdrive. Our house is very near the sidewalk and the area it encompasses is quite large. I expect a great many false alarms of movement detected nowhere near my front door or porch. I'll have to check to see if there's a feature limiting how many feet out motion is detected. If it's not there, that would be a great addition.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2022"

4639,Bennett,Very disappointing and illogical,"  I have another brand of doorbell, and thought it would be an ""upgrade"" to go to an Amazon brand. Nope! There are so many issues. First, when you make a change to the settings, it requires either 24 hours to pass, or for the doorbell to be pressed. That's insanely stupid, and has no logical purpose. So I ""arm"" the doorbell, or turn on motion detection, and it sits 24 hours before turning it on!? What's the purpose of wifi connected devices if they expect you to be there to use it? Secondly, the app sucks. It's hard to use, and doesn't always notify. Third, the night quality is way lower than other brands. Fourth, unlike other brands, you can't look at live mode unless ""and event"" is happening. Maybe I just want to look at outside the front door!? Especially since it fails to notify me many times. Or, someone pushed the doorbell, and I missed it but they are still there and I want to talk to them. It makes you wait 60 seconds for a ""new event."" The thinking here is backwards.

I live in an apartment complex and yes the notifications can be frequent if you have that setting on.  I turned off that notification but left the doorbell notification on.  so when someone rings the door bell I get a ring on my cell phone.  The motion detection is still on and it records perfectly day and night.  I just go into the app and view or delete those that have been recorded.  Yup, I don't trust some of the neighbors in my complex to again this gives me a sense of security while at home and comfort while i travel.

4706,Heather Wyatt,Falls short of the mark,"  At first glance, this camera hits all the marks,  with cloud storage/local option, motion detection, night vision and wired installation.While many have complained about the mounting, if you follow the included instructions, it's a piece of cake. I have called and emailed their support team,  and found wait times were acceptable and their email responses timely,  even during this pandemic. They have the option of viewing your camera configuration via a toggle in the app to help them support you. You can shut it off at any time,  or it will revert back to of automatically after 24 hours. Either way,  they can not are your live video or clips.Here's where they missed the mark:1. It takes a bit of time to detect motion.  Not exactly seconds, but it does cause you to miss the start of the video event.Blink: The solution would be to pre-record continually,  but only save a few seconds of video prior to the recording when motion is detected. I know why Blink didn't do this,  it's because of the next issue.2. While this unit is wired,  it does not supply power to the camera,  rather it relies on rather expensive and environmentally unfriendly disposable (non rechargeable) lithium batteries. After owning my camera for just over a month,  it is time to replace them. Blink claims up to a year,  depending upon use.  Technically,  1 month is up to a year,  but not the issue. I live on a busy street,  so it does record quite a bit.  Isn't that what is supposed to do? You can play with settings to mask areas to not detect motion,  but that doesn't make sense to me. I have a video camera so I can see the comings and goings in the front of my house.  There is also the option to arm/disarm but who wants to be bothered to have to turn it on and off and who is to say a video event won't happen when you are gone and presumed disarmed?Blink: Please make a module that can be installed to use the power already present in the wired doorbell circuit to power the phone maybe even include a small LiPo cell to float charge for times when power is out or the button is pressed.3. Video clips are configurable to 10-30 seconds long.  If a particular motion lasts longer,  you have to wait 10 seconds for it to retrigger and continue recording, but you miss 10 or so seconds of video.Blink: With a powered solution and the sync module,  it should be easy to configure continual motion recording bound by motion,  not a predefined amount of time with a firmware and app update,  but again. I'm sure the power is the limiting factor.Blink seems to have an active presence in their reviews and questions. Hopefully they will listen to their customer suggestions and turn an OK camera to a top of the line product.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2022"

   It does well at detecting motion outside of my carport. It usually detects motion up to 10 feet away. Even at night (pretty alright night vision). However, this thing drains batteries quickly. I’ve had to change the batteries already and it’s been less than a year of having the camera. Lithium batteries should not be drained this quickly, and my settings are set to where it shouldn’t be causing unnecessary use of the camera.

4713,Chanda,Not flimsy it works but removing the bell would make you think your breaking it so that’s flimsy,"  Update: My battery says low, it’s been exactly 1 month of usage so now I’ll need to replace the batteries. But I get many alerts and yes I do watch live videos throughout the day so 1 battery per month is reasonable for the amount of use my bell is used. No one really rings the bell because I don’t have visitors Only maybe delivery person might ring it once in awhile. Also at night people faces shows up as a white light. So You can’t see who it is at all. Now That’s not kool.Well In the settings I tried several times to adjust ringer volume to low but it won’t save it at all. It’s either no ring sound or loud ring sound and nothing in between. Needs  a fix.Unable to share bell with others so I’m guessing You will need to give them your login info. Not kool! It does not have pre recorded messages where I can just press a option to tell visitors a quick message with out opening my mouth. That’s not too good for people with disabilities where they can’t speak to others. Hopefully in the near future this feature would be added.And there is no glow on my bell So that visitors could see it’s actually a bell so they could push the button. Maybe it’s to save the battery life so it’s understandable BUT when there is a wired option you would think you wouldn’t need to rely on batteries. So installing the wired option just doesn’t make too much sense at all. Unless people just don’t want there old wired bell’s wires to show or something. So thatWould be understandable. Blink shouldn’t have there customers believe that they have a wired option where you don’t even need batteries for it to operate. That’s the only reason I bought the bell because I thought I really could use it on Wired Power. So I still will need to rely on batteries but at least I won’t need to wait for batteries to charge. So that’s good and is different from other video bells too. Nice idea!If I keep the bell I hope the batteries won’t run out super fast and I hope they add some  pre recorded messages so customers could  just click on a response to have the visitor hear and respond to. Remember everyone can’t speak and some  just don’t want to speak to visitors sometimes. So give us those pre recordings. Example-  Hello please leave package right here. & Hello please give me a min to come to the door & Hello I can’t come to the door at the moment but please leave a message if you need to Thank You!It could be a really nice bell if these issues were fixed and improved. The Picture quality is nice at daytime and just okay at night.I’m debating on if I’m returning it or not since wires don’t supply power to the bell which was the only reason I bought it. Also some people have vacation homes and can’t always  get there to charge or replace batteries. Please improve the bell to make the wired option really run off of electricity.Another option for this bell would be to use it in the house as a video intercom for when I want to speak to my family when they are upstairs’ or downstairs. But I already have devices that does that so hopefully these options would be available in the near future.I really don’t think this is HD quality and infrared doesn’t work that well. I noticed the difference from my other branded bells.  But at least it runs on just 2 AA lithium batteries which could be simpler for some users, so maybe that’s why it’s not the same or better than other brand bells. So it’s unique in its own special way.When Blink decides to make another bell hopefully the term  wired really means wired aka runs on electricity and the button will stay lit so visitors could have a clue You have a bell. And perhaps it would have crisp HD video quality and several pre recorded response messages, different bell tunes , a rechargeable battery option because I’m not too sure if it’s safe for regular battery to be combined with a wired option. And hopefully it would be waterproof too and is able to be shared with family members without them having full access to be able to change the settings.I kinda do recommend this bell to some people who just wants an affordable simple video door bell who don’t mind regular ( not so sharp) video quality.Also HD not crisp and you  can’t share with family.Without the cloud planIt does work without the subscription plan but you can’t record, or save the recordings when you do a live viewing and they punish you also by not allowing you to see camera icon, bell icon or the yellow dot that Allows  you to know you have a new motion alert. It’s just a play icon with the motion icon even if someone rings the bell.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2022"

The only way you hear the doorbell is on Alexa devices so if you’re far away from an echo you can’t even hear it. So you basically have to fill your house with echos. There’s no plug in speaker option just for the doorbell. The load time for live view is RIDICULOUSLY SLOW to the point someone can already be gone by the time it loads. On top of the fact that you now have to pay monthly for it to save a clip of who rang the bell. While my cameras I don’t have to pay for ! The only good thing I can really say Is that for the price it works. I do appreciate that with it linked to echos they can announce when motion is detected.

I have no problem with that; it just took a little adjustment. However, the app did not detect PEOPLE that were walking by. I don't understand how a car driving by 30 - 40 feet away can trigger an alert but people walking on the sidewalk in front of my house (about 20 - 25 feet away) triggers nothing. It worked for people walking up to my porch (when they were literally at my front steps) and for people ringing the doorbell. But it's useless for signaling when people were not within spitting distance.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2022"
4735,Sunny,Two of these have been great to track deliveries and visitors,"  We have a front door that drivers keep leaving packages at despite an easy to read ""Please deliver all packages to back door"" sign mounted at eye level in front of the steps to the door. We also have a non-functional front door with steps, railing, and door knob all removed that they've left packages under. Sometimes even on the door to our deck on the opposite side of the house from the driveway (with no sidewalk leading there). We got 2 of these doorbells to see where TF they go in the front of the house when packages are not delivered to the back door as directed, and to monitor the back door. The front door had a wired bell with a bad button so it barely worked. The rear door did not have one so we previously used a simple wireless doorbell. After missing a UPS package that required a signature, we found the chime batteries were dead and decided it was time. With the Blink cameras we could at least monitor battery life via the app, and get alerted to a delivery if we weren't close enough to hear the chime. Or if the package was just dropped without ringing the doorbell.We love being able to see what's going on, or what activity there was near a door, and even get an alert when someone pulls into our driveway due to the range of coverage.However, the documentation is confusing. With both wired to our existing chime the cameras report ""external power OK"" instead of ""Battery OK"", so I'm not sure how to monitor battery life. Documentation on that is lacking, and the notification settings don't match what I see in Android 12. Documentation states the doorbell always runs on battery though, so the change in monitoring is confusing at first glance until you dig through FAQs for the official answer:The Blink Video Doorbell closes the power circuit of your existing chime system, it does not provide power of any kind. If the chime system loses power for any reason, the doorbell only plays the Blink Chime sound and your existing chime will not activate.I don't recall if this was covered in the FAQs/documentation I read before buying, but I found out during the install that I didn't need to make any changes to the wired chime like with Wyze (requires you to bypass the chime making it no long function so the doorbell can be powered) and other models. Install was so much easier than I expected, aside from having to run a new wire to our back door just to tie that doorbell into the wired chime. Now we'll be able to add another doorbell to our side door to monitor the deck without any wiring, and the sync module saves us the monthly cloud fee.Motion capture has been a bit weird. I have field of view blocked off from the house side of the front sidewalk to the top of the view to ignore the street and nearby tree branches. Yet we still get motion alerts from the occasional car passing by on the street. Seems more frequent at night, especially vehicles with reflective paint/stickers (police cars, school buses, etc). Front door view is kind of dark, despite a nearby street light, but I don't want to turn up the IR intensity if it'll generate more alerts from traffic. I also walked the dog across the entire front lawn (the whole area I have set to monitor) during the day and it did not trigger a motion alert.In the end, it's great getting the alerts we do. It was more than we got before, and the doorbell chimes should be more reliable now in addition to getting the phone alerts when out of hearing range of the wired chime.

The free version will do the latter two but in order to capture live video and motion detected video to will need to purchase a subscription. $3 a month for one camera/device $10 a month for more than 1. Kind of changes the whole dynamic. I went back and reread the description and still can find that info. I learned about it, not from the instructions inside the box, because there are none.

It will now not connect (pics attached) and I cannot connect it manually, either. The doorbell’s network stopped showing up in my Wi-Fi list.There is absolutely zero customer support for technical issues with Blink. When you call, it rings and then sends you to a voicemail. The voicemail basically says “hey we aren’t going to get this, please enter a support ticket online.” When you go online, the support article sends you in circles, never with anyway to actually contact anyone.I’m technically savvy enough, I’ve tried everything, and I’m at the point of giving up.

4769,Marilyn Cote Miller,Wow!,"  I’m really impressed with the wireless capabilities of this doorbell. It has the following benefits:1. Easy to use2. Clear images from camera3. Took me less than 5 min to installOne tip that I have, which others have with getting the seal to work is this—you need to align the doorbell to the plate by: 1) angle the doorbell at around 70-80 degrees (towards you), 2) you need to firmly press back into the plate and down. If you have arthritis of the hands, this might be quite difficult to put enough force down to get the backplate to click.Also, it should be noted, anything wireless and operated by a battery will have some lag time in the app (that’s the nature of product engineering when you’re running an electronic device that doesn’t have a continual source of energy like a power cord). So, it’s to be expected to have some sort of a lag or few second delay for the video to show up on the app (I have gigabit internet) and it still lags a little but nothing to the point where I wouldn’t want to use this device.Note for product UX testers at Blink: I would recommend trying out this product with folks of different abilities of hand usage and I would also probably recommend testing a slew of  instructional videos that show different angles of how to properly get the backplate snapping in.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 11, 2022"

4781,Juan Henriquez,Great quality picture.,"  We were gifted a couple of Blink outdoor cameras. After setting them up, we discovered that they were pretty amazing. But sadly, even though Amazon owns both, they couldn't be added to our existing Ring Doorbell video account. So...the Ring plan has now cancelled and that doorbell has been moved on to one of our kids and a new Blink Doorbell has been added to our new Blink Plus account.The Blink Doorbell is much more affordable than the Ring but still produces excellent video and sound quality and does everything the Ring did.No complaints really except one: Blink needs to separate the doorbell out from the cameras so it still senses motion and send alerts and records video when the outdoor/indoor cameras are disarmed. Which we do when we are outside in the backyard so we don't get constant alerts and run the batteries down on the outdoor cameras. BUT it would be nice to know if a package arrives or someone walks up to our door because the Blink Doorbell is also disarmed. It WILL record and alert us, but only if someone pushes the button on the doorbell. This should be an easy fix for the code monkey boffins typing away in Jeff's basement.The other complaint (only tangentially connected to Blink) is that Amazon needs to fix it to so when we purchase a Blink product as Blink Plus Plan subscribers (yes, it is linked to our Amazon account) that the Amazon website/app automatically applies the 10% discount to our order. It is currently a pain to have to contact customer service and have them make the adjustment every dang time we buy a Blink item.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2022"

Anything will trigger the camera, including simple light changes. I am so tired of seeing a bunch of notifications pop up about movement outside only to discover that it is a completely still frame of nothing. Just a simple light change in the sky.However, there is also the issue of the camera taking forever to connect to my phone or my echo shows to show me who is at the door when the doorbell is rung. More than often it will alert me that someone is at the door when they ring the doorbell, just to tell me connection failed when I pull up the app on my phone to see who it is. Anyone who rings my doorbell has to wait a long time for me to finally pull up the live feed and see who they are and be able to talk to them.The clips only go up to 30 seconds in length and then take a while to start recording another clip of there is still motion detected.Overall, the camera quality is 3/5 in my opinion. Most of the faces still show up blurry unless the person is standing directly in front of the camera.

4810,Gail R Caldwell,Don’t waste your money,"  I’ve had this doorbell for less than 5 months and I’ve already bought a ring doorbell to replace it. I also purchased the sync module to avoid a monthly fee. About 2.5/3 months of using the doorbell I started getting constant phone notifications that there was motion detected. And when I say constant at least 1 a minute and if I cleared the notification it would just send another. When I accessed the app and went to check the video of the motion, nothing had recorded. My earliest available videos were a week old. On top of this, the notifications were so steady that it drained the battery. I thought that maybe purchasing the monthly plan might help (I wasn’t sure if it was the sync module)n I followed the directions online and synced my Amazon account to the blink account, but never got the option to buy a plan. I changed the battery and unplugged the module for about 3 days and thought I would try it again. It’s been about a month, and now it’s happening again. Battery is dead, my phone is going off nonstop, and yet there isn’t a single video recorded. This doorbell defeats the entire purpose of having a doorbell camera.

The Sync module keeps dropping our wifi signal and doesn't automatically reconnect, just sits and blinks (ha, maybe that's where they got the name?). Customer service and tech support have been worthless. All they do is help us reconnect the Sync module, which works anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour, until it goes offline again. Ridiculous. I work from home all day, it's not a wifi issue.And the motion sensing capabilities might be ok, but by the time I get the notification and open up the app and camera on my phone, it's been 30-45 seconds and anything that was on the camera is long gone. I'm not sure if that's a Blink fault or just a fault of home motion sensing cameras in general.We got this for a Black Friday deal, now it's mid-April and I'm ready to return this stupid thing and get a Ring.

4837,Bryan,Read full review,"  Summary: I gave it three stars simply for two huge reasons. Number one, the back is nearly impossible to get on and off I actually accidentally broke mine and now I have to hot glue it every time I change a batteries which scares me someone is just going to take it off… number two and probably the BIGGEST complaint I have…. It does NOT alert you when the batteries die.Full picture: I have to thank this camera as it probably saved my life this year. A homeless woman forced her way into my apartment without my permission. I had this camera turned off at that point because I had felt extremely safe in my apartment until that day where she forced her way into my door despite my pleas to leave me alone. That same night I turned on my camera. To my disbelief she had the nerve to harass me at odd hours of the night and day for the next two weeks. I have this camera to thank for knowing that it was in fact her creepily staring straight at my door swaying and begging I let her in to “talk”. I have no idea what her intentions are, but I do know that this camera helped me put a stop to the harassment I was experiencing. NOW the reason I gave it such a low rating is because my camera randomly stopped working today. I wasn’t given any alerts it just stopped. After everything that’s happened and still occasionally seeing the woman pacing outside of my complex I panicked not knowing why it wasn’t working and how long a replacement would take to arrive. After stressing all day at work, I took it off the wall peeled off the hot glue from the last time I had to open it, and  it turned out that the batteries were dead… I had checked the app multiple times throughout the day and the battery status displayed as “OK”. I feel that it should give you a low battery warning but mine simply did not, now, if I had not had this event happen to me I would have given this camera five stars, but until my lease is up I am reliant on this device to keep me and my loved ones safe.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2022"

I got one all set up and ready to install by my front door when I read on the doorbell FAQs online that it still operates on battery even when wired to your existing (or new) doorbell transformer. Turns out the “wired” description only applies to hooking it up to operate your old doorbell chime.

4868,Angel Martinez,My First Impression... Not Impressed,"  First and foremost, this doorbell has a very loud ear piercing feedback coming from it. I submitted a ticket, because clearly you can't talk to a person, within 24 hours of installing it. It's now been about 5 days and they are still troubleshooting it! Frankly, that is terrible in my mind because no one has called me and they only communicate with me once every day or two. Meanwhile, I couldn't communicate with someone who came to my door if I needed to, which negates the entire purpose of this doorbell. As much as I hated my Ring doorbell, so far it runs circles around the Blink doorbell in terms of a communication device.All that said, the video itself looks fine although I probably should install a wedge so it points down more.  Motion sensors are sensitive and I'm still trying to find the sweet spot, but I'm sure I will. The ability to block out areas to not sense is nice and easy to use.Until they can fix the above mentioned issue with the ear piercing squeal, This will remain as a two star review.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2022"

4871,RandyGreer,Not impressed,"  It works, but I HATE that you have to press the doorbell to activate changes you make through the app (like arming/disarming or activating motion detection). The doorbell is obviously outside my home, so it almost defeats the purpose to make me go outside and press the button every time I want to arm my system or apply motion detection, esp times when I'd like to arm it while I'm away from home. I also expected it to have a live view setting that can be turned on instantly through the app like the indoor camera does. I hear that is available when it is wired or used alongside a Sync device, but I wanted it as a standard feature.

4955,Am,It’s good,"  I initially became interested in a doorbell camera as I am a 23 year old female who works from home, and my husband leaves every morning at the same time to work. I have had “creeps” stopping by my door & trying to get inside. I decided to get the Blink doorbell camera because of the price and couple of reviews I seen regarding quality. I also like that you simply pay $9.99/month for all cameras on 1 module, to save & view all videos. These fees are amazing compared to any other brand like Ring & such. The picture quality is also okay, it’s not 100% clear, but clear enough that you know exactly what’s going on. (Can’t complain for a camera that was $50)The lithium (strongest/longest lasting batteries) batteries were only good for maybe 2 weeks before they died. I then have had to replace the batteries minimum once every week now. (With minimal motion activity setting off my camera, so it’s actually barely in use) My money is now being spent strictly on batteries. Which are pretty expensive to be continuously buying every week.Motion sometimes kicks on when absolutely nothing motions the camera (must be the wind, haha), and I’ve also had people walk by my door, and the camera only started recording as soon as the back of their last foot was leaving the picture frame… lol..Always be careful when changing the batteries. I have dropped my camera multiple times now as when I go to unlock the bottom piece to detach the camera, it immediately just pops up and the camera goes flying no matter how gentle I am.  I don’t have a problem with it other than the things I named, but when it’s time is ready to be replaced, I for sure will be getting a better more quality camera than the Blink. It’s pretty defective. But it does what you need it to do for the time being until you can invest in something better.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2022"

We usually do our homework before any purchases these days because a lot of items seem to miss or omit descriptions of an item.  When we purchase the Blink doorbell we thought we could add it on to our existing system!  We were not aware that we had to purchase a Blink Subscription Plan at the time.  After a 30 day free subscription ended the doorbell we are getting a message that: No clip recorded"" ""This camera is not recording because you do not have a Blink Storage Plan"".  We also cannot return the doorbell camera because time has expired on it.  This is just a warning to those that were caught unaware that blink now charges for their new systems.  I did contact Blink's customer service and was told that we would have to purchase a Blink subscription in order to use the camera.  Now we have a useless $49.00 camera that does not work. Not too happy about this!!!!",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 15, 2022"

4976,Jeff H.,The app is crap,"  Nice camera system, however the app is far from something useful and intuitive, also is extremely slow. Do not recommend this product at least until they have a better app",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2022"
4977,Latasha Newburn,What you'd expect for that price,"  The video is pretty crisp and exceeded my expectations! Sound is there as well, doesn't capture too much background noise.There is a wireless and wired function, I use wireless. It doesn't record 24/7 unfortunately and the motion detection doesn't work all too well even when the armed option is enabled in the blink app.The doorbell is loud enough to hear just on the other side of the wall, notifications are set to my phone seeing I haven't figured out how to set it up with Google if even able to seeing it has Alexa functionality.Overall, it's works for the price it is. But don't get your hopes too high thinking it will do everything any other smart camera doorbell will do.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2022"

4984,Juan Cardenas,"Does bot record anything, nor does it justify the idea of a camera.","  Terrible, I pay money for a monthly subscription (That was not mentioned when I bought it) and It still does not catch any recordings or all of the motion in front of my door.

4985,Joanne W,It’s decent,  Not a horrible product. It is supposed to lock on the base when mounted to a surface. It does not. So essentially someone can just pull it off. The motion detection is okay. It doesn’t pick up everything that passes in front of it. It seems to have a lot of delay in it at times. Not totally satisfied but I guess it’s better than paying for Ring.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2022"

4988,Nisha,Top clips would not engage.,"  I had the same mounting issues many reviewers have pointed out. In my case the middle and bottom clips engaged but the top ones would not, resulting in a gap at the top. I followed the directions starting by angling it top first, making sure the slots lined up with the tabs and then pushing it flush and down until it clicked. After many frustrating attempts, I removed the mounting plate and tried to see if the clips would even engage off of the wall. Again, the bottom and middle clips engaged, the lock at the bottom clicked, but there was no way to get the top ones to engage. I also tried the hints from other reviews to press really hard against the wall while pressing it down into place but that failed to engage the top clips. I suspect mine may have had malformed clips at the top because they looked different from the middle and bottom ones. Amazon support told me a replacement mount is not available and told me to return it and buy another one. After reading the many reviews about mounting issues, I decided to just return it and not get another one.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2022"

4999,sharon,Do not buy,"  I purchase this doorbell with high hopes. The first one I purchased was defective and did not work. That should have been a sign.I exchanged the doorbell and the second worked for about 2 weeks. The batteries died within 2 weeks. I went and purchased new  lithium batteries 1.5 V, like specified. Put the batteries in and it did not detect. Tried another set of Lithium batteries and still nothing.  I tried calling support and no help. I emailed and it took 3 days to get back, they stated I needed to turn a setting on in the app, did that and another 3 days go by. I tried removing and adding the device back and nothing.This product is garbage and not worth the money. The support team is no exist.  Don’t waste your money.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 26, 2022"
