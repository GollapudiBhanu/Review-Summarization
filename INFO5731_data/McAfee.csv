0,S. Marshall Priddy,It's basically the same as malware in and of itself,"  Total waste of money.  SO SO SO obnoxious.  It decided to change my default browser to Yahoo.  Okay, well you can switch it back, right?  Sure, but it's going to nag you to re-enable it on like a weekly basis.  I ended up uninstalling and regretting I ever wasted money on this.The whole point of trying to protect your computer is that I want to do what I WANT to do, not have pop ups, not have some software I'm not trying to run steal all resources and make the things I want to do go slower.  It just ruins your computer, steals your time, runs programs you don't want at bad times, opens windows you didn't ask for, and generally takes control of your computer while booting you to the role of supplicant having to ask its permission to do anything.  It's got all of the bad aspects of actual malware, leaving you wondering what the point is.If anyone has a good recommendation for an anti-malware packages that isn't an annoying interjection all the time or a resource hog—that is, something that will quietly do it's work in the background and only bother you if there's a real threat, rather than getting all up in your face screaming about whatever it thinks is important when there's really nothing going on—I'm all ears.  I hate this software A LOT.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2018"
1,Amazon Customer,I replaced the free versions of Avast anti-virus and Malwarebytes ...,"  I replaced the free versions of Avast anti-virus and Malwarebytes with McAfee because I wanted a full featured single product solution that would run automatically. I'm sorry I made that decision as both Avast and Malwarebytes functioned well and kept my PC protected. Also, I was able to load both programs and a couple other offerings I tested seamlessly and with no issues. Unfortunately, I did not do a pre-test with McAfee and paid for it. It took me over 6 hours of my time and 2 sessions with McAfee support to finally get a successful install. The MacAfee ""100% percent, we're with you all the way"" satisfaction promise is a complete joke. After they gave up on me I had to do a couple hours of research to address the issues they could not help me with. I think that any low level tech support person could have at least pointed me in the direction of resolving the issues I had, but McAfee could not. I had to go through several cleanup and removal operations, (along with some other actions), and load the software as an administrator. What a nightmare. The load on my Mac went OK but the functioning seems to be a bit flakey. Because of the time I've invested, I'm not going to remove it and ask for a refund. If one doesn't encounter any install problems then it's a passable product. However, there are several other full featured programs available and I would suggest investigating those.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2018"
2,Aileen Arzate,Dont waste your money,  I have always used mcafee but after today never again the code kept giving me error i called the tech support and they wete trying to scam me put of 200 for an additional fire wall on my laptop and when i told them i didnt want to pay that they said i couldn't even get a refund that i had to pay 200 for the firewall in order to install in the antivirus in my laptop.

3,rat racer,Good product overall,"  You do get the annoying messages from the application to install on another device, remove cookies and trackers, etc.  These should be there when you click the application.  Overall a good product for the price and I haven't had any viruses.  I realized that after five years I probably could've done with the simple Antivirus version (cheaper too) instead of the Total Protection version but at least I didn't pay full price by going through Amazon.  For those with installation issues, I suggest you do the following:1. Create a McAfee account with an email and password BEFORE you install.  This way you are not going back and forth confusing yourself with multiple windows up.2.  Close everything else from your screen except Internet Explorer or Chrome that you are going to use to install the software.  Both browsers work for me for the installation.3. Click the installation once. If you've installed it before, chose the New Subscription and not the Renew Subscription (at least I do it this way to get a clean install).4.  Leave it alone and do not do anything else.  It took between 15 to 20 minutes for me because it had to remove prior installations.  It also prompted me to restart my computer.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2018"
4,CaliGal,Perfect and super easy,"  It doesn't get better than this. From the low price to the convenience this was perfect in every way. The moment I ordered it I was able to find it in my digital purchase section and once I clicked the link to the MacAfee site I entered the code and simply followed the prompts. It even automatically removes old versions of their product. They do send the code to your email as well but you can just go straight to your digital purchases section to save time. Coverage this easy to install for a couple computers and your smartphone for a year and under $25? Perfect.Update 2019: I just purchased it again a year later at $26.99 instead of the $50+ everywhere else and again within just a few minutes it removed the older version, did a fresh install and it even carried over the few days from my last time towards the new amount of days protected.  Coverage for 3 devices just doesn't get more affordable or easier than this.Update 2020: I had 20 days left so I bought this again and it worked like a charm for the 3rd year in a row. Buy it, go to your digital purchase section, copy and paste the key. They even have a link that opens up the site where you enter the key. It took all of a couple minutes and added 365 days to my subscription. I also want to add that running this and a decent adblocker meant no problems at all in the last year so this actually works.Update 2021: With about 5 weeks left on my subscription I noticed the price dropped from $27.99 down to $19.99 for this and bought the digital download code again. It was instantly delivered to my email and appeared in my ""Games and Software Library"". In under a minute my subscription was extended for another year plus I didn't lose the days I had left on my current paid subscription from last year either. I'll keep updating every year with positive reviews as long as they make this hassle free and an honest transaction. If it ever changes I'll also post a bad review but so far it's all positive 4 years in a row.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2018"
5,Mike T.,I'm a bit disappointed. I do understand they are a good product,"  One day after I bought it, after hours trying to install it, I called McAfee and asked for their cash back guarantee. I was told they would send me a check (really? I paid via debit card). It's been two weeks now and nothing. I'm a bit disappointed. I do understand they are a good product, just really poor service.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2018"
6,Joseph V.,*******  DO NOT BUY McAfee PRODUCT ********,"  1.  The installation process STINKS as it leads you into a circular loop whereby you CANNOT use the download option for an ACTUAL download.  Why?  According to the tech I messaged they do NOT want you to run ANY other virus programs and he told me I MUST DELETE Avast.  Huh?  Where does it say that BEFORE you buy the program?  2.  There was NO error message during the above saga and NO help online to walk you through what to do.  3.  When it finally installed there were TWO icons created on my mac and both were GENERIC icons with NOTHING saying McAfee.  How bush league.  4.  Then I got ALL kinds of errors when I started to scan saying something about a ""Unknown error received from a scanner"" but with NO OTHER instructions - this popped up SEVERAL TIMES.  5.  I also got an installation error that said - ""You can't open the application ""McAfeeMacInstaller.app because it may be DAMAGED or incomplete"" - AGAIN - with NO instructions on what to do or how to fix it.  Oddly, it shortly finished the installation AFTER the error!  Jeez.  6.  THEN I got ANOTHER error ""System Extension BLOCKED"" and when I googled it McAfee's OWN WEBSITE said they KNEW of the problem and to NOT do what the instructions said which are to ENABLE McAfee under Security and Privacy of system preferences.  Are you kidding me guys?  This is UNACCEPTABLE!  7.  Then the ""Full Scan"" took FOREVER and was EXCEEDINGLY SLOW with NO % competed and a SOLID BLUE progress bar which means it's done when it was NOT done.  I STOPPED it after 12 hours or so as I was fed up waiting 8.  There is NO ESTIMATE for the duration of the scan and from what I read on the McAfee site this could take DAYS to run and in the end there are NO INSTRUCTIONS for how to FIX the ACTUAL problems.  Why run a scan for 2 days and then NOT FIX the malware?  9.  During the LogMeIn Session the tech CLOSED programs of mine WITHOUT ASKING!!!  How RUDE  **** Summary **** Do NOT buy this product.  I will soon be contacting McAfee and DEMANDING A FULL REFUND.  This is the **worse** damn software product I believe I've EVER used in 30 years of computing!!!!

7,Joseph V.,So easy.,"  I've been using McAfee for almost 20 years and never (knock on wood) had a virus since. Problem is, it's just too expensive to buy through them. Unless you call or get on chat, they'll come down but if you don't have time for that this is the best. Buy it, go to your media here on Amazon copy the code, click link and if you're already a customer of McAfee you're signed in and off and running.

8,Lisa FFC,A scam that worked in the end,"  It wouldn't install so I called 888-996-0392 the # that came up with the error code. I talked to a rep (about 40 minutes) who explained I had a trojan invasion, had been hacked by a foreign entity and needed a fire wall for $898; after saying that was too much he had a deal of 3 year coverage for $300. After he got angry with me for not buying, I hung up. I called 866-622-3911 the next day and talked to a legitimate tech who after an hour finally got the product installed.

9,Cecil Zee,"Scam, READ THIS!","  Does this deal seem too good to be true?  Well it is. I never write reviews, but I do not want people to fall into the same trap I did. The link provided by Amazon isn't even valid and leads nowhere. Then I looked up where to activate my McAfee 25 digit code. I accidentally browsed to a fake McAfee site they did not have a capital A in name, it was lower case. I did not catch it and it seemed very legit. I put in my name, phone number and 25 digit code and it validated and wasn't working. 3rd party scammer chat window on the side had me go to a website fastsupport.com so they could take control of my machine. I work in IT (yes this sounds bad) but a couple times I've had to call places to install special programs this way. I did not research and see I browsed to a fake site that was so identical, just no capital A in the address bar in the word McAfee. Once the ""tech"" took control of my machine he was doing basic and phony command prompts trying to show me a ""virus"" to sell me something. Said my network was infected with foreign IPs which was bogus. The reason it could not download the software was because of a virus was on the computer. I literally just took it out of the box and purchased this code at the same time. No way it could have a virus. The so-called ""virus"" was just a csrss.exe error but this is a part of the windows operating system! I ended the remote session and questioned the guy about certain things and he would just not answer and got very angry about why I ended the session. It's just a scam for them to charge you a ton of money to fix your computer and they don't even do anything. I found the real McAfee site and asked the guy if he was familiar with the number I was called on (888)-882-1699 and they said no and do not use fastsupport.com. Seems like many people in the reviews have had a scam attempt. DON'T FALL FOR IT!  I am going back to Malwarebytes.

11,Nividia009,Took an hour to use this to renew my McAfee license,"  I had already had this very same product for a year.  When my one year license was about to expire, I purchased this to renew for another year because it is much cheaper through Amazon than renewing through the options that the McAfee software provides.  Amazon immediately provided me the activation code, so it SHOULD have been a simple price of finding a place to enter the code and renew my license.  Searched for 20 minutes and couldn't find a place.  Called McAfee customer support.  After thirty-five minutes, two customer support people, and a session in which I had to grant one of them remote control access to my computer, I am now licensed for another year.  I hope McAfee enjoys this final year that they have me as a customer.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2019"

I bought McAfee last year from Amazon and did not have any problems.I should have come back to here rather than adding a new review.  I called McAfee, talked with a very nice gentleman about getting a refund.  He suggest I first talk to a tech which I did.  She was able to install the program and get it up and running.  If you're having trouble with this upgrade, give McAfee a call.  I've used their programs for over 20 years and so far as I know, they work fine.  It's frustrating when a program won't load and you don't know why or how to get it to work.  Too often you have to pay to get any help.

14,Mac,Stay away. The True Key app that it installs has created password hell. No support at all!,"  I first installed this on my PC a year and a half ago. All went well with the security side. But the True Key password protector began as a nice option but quickly turned into a nightmare. Rewriting and overwriting my passwords without prompting, causing me to create endless new passwords and also making me dependent on this crap to access my accounts. When it came time to renew I didn't. I went to Windows Defender for free. It works great for protecting my PC.  Then True Key no longer allowed for new password additions. I had to use it manually to launch accounts.  I could edit them manually. I was okay with that. But then my computer updated and True key asked for my Master password.  I could not remember it. So I contacted their support line. That resulted in three nights of hour plus long calls with someone in India constantly apologizing for not having the authorization to help me reset my password.  When I prompt the software to reset. It would eventually send a new password reset after the 10 minute time limit and then would not allow me to reset. So bottom line. Good luck.  McAffee accepts no responsibility for this software.  If you buy,  disable the True Key. It has made my life hell. I repurchased the software and hoped to get it working but now I am uninstalling everything. Never want to hear from McAffee again.

15,Shop till you drop,Easy install! Cheaper to renew through Amazon!,"  If your running this anti-viral already then your going to probably have an online account showing your subscription. When it expires, you simply purchase the downloadable version from Amazon and it presents to you what looks like a typical alpha-numeric license key.You log onto your McAfee account and where it says, ""redeem a retail card"" place your license key in there, it registers you for another year and runs you through the install process. It may go a little faster if you don't have any McAfee software installed on your system, otherwise it will go through an uninstall process first. Once completed, it will go through a fresh install of the current software. When your done, your good for a year.>>>Important <<<Nothing against McAfee but i'd prefer to order the software on the cheap from Amazon yearly. If you install this software but leave the auto-renew on, if you have a stored credit card, next year McAfee might grab up to $90 bucks for the renew.Anti-viral software is a necessity but I'd rather pay less then $25-$30 then $89.That's a big difference!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2019"

I'm so disappointed.  You can do pop-ups in the corner of my computer for months and months that say my protection is expired but nothing that says hey we are going to just take some money from your bank account!!  Really, McAfee, do you think with everything that is happening right now people have extra money for you to take?  I feel like I have been hacked by the company that is supposed to be protecting me.

Days later, it still throws errors and the firewall stops working.3.  Their firewall requires extensive support to set up.  And then it stops working!4. Their support appears to be based in India or Pakistan.  Clear communication and getting them to understand what I needed was very difficult.  If it wasn't in their scripts (which they repeatedly read from) it really threw them off and they had to keep asking other support people.5.

23,LAW,"Adequate for Windows, Horrible for Mac. Here's Why.","  I bought the 3-machine license to install on my family's computers at home: one Windows PC and two Macs. Installation was straightforward, but activating the licenses was extremely problematic on both Windows and Mac. In both cases, the license activation failed and I had to contact McAfee tech support for them to remotely activate the licenses - nearly 45 minutes in each case.Once installed, McAfee works fine on Windows, but it's an absolute train wreck on Mac. McAfee slows down Macs so badly that it makes them nearly unusable. Bootup, login, and applications grind at a glacial speed. I finally got so fed up with having to force quit unresponsive or excessively slow applications, reboot, restart, etc. that I finally uninstalled McAfee on one of my Macs (I never installed it on the other because the experience on the first Mac has been so horrible).I have used Norton for years and have been pretty pleased overall. I decided to switch to McAfee because Norton has a bunch of unnecessary add ons and is a bit more expensive than McAfee. Never again. When my PC license expires, I'll buy Norton instead.Pros:If you're running a Windows machine, McAfee is adequate.Very easy to uninstallCons:License activation was a massive pain that required McAfee technical support to remotely activate the licenses (twice)McAfee destroys application speed on Mac.

25,David C.,Low quality security product full of adware,"  I've used McAfee products for many years. Every next one release seems to be getting worse than the previous one. And they care less and less about the users of their products.What is wrong within the product? :* It installs so many services that it practically hijacks my laptop.* It incorrectly reports intrusion attempts. How? Every TCP/IP connection has a standard way of termination by both sides which takes time according to applicable standards. Such termination involves packets going in both directions to indicate connection finalization. McAfee product uses smaller (substandard) timeout values and prevents proper closure of TCP/IP connections and then reports packets beyond those incorrect timeouts as intrusion attempts. Those are not real intrusion attempts, it is just incorrect McAfee implementation of networking standards.* 60 days before subscription expiration, the product starts showing popup messages which take 1/4 of the QHD (2560x1440) screen! They are shown 2+ times a day every day! They even show up while I am sharing my screen with customers.* Their customer support is in India and does not even understand the basic layout of the windows desktop. When I reported to them the issue with ad popups that ask me to buy their _McAfee_ products, they tell me it is a malware within the web browser. They are totally incompetent. I kept explaining to them that I don't use web browser and that popups are shown on the system tray of the desktop and ads are about their products. They don't understand and completely clueless. And the product does not have settings for almost anything, it is like it is not intended to be adjusted to user's needs.* The previous version of that product had a problem that you cannot uninstall it unless you allow within the firewall connectivity to google-analytics.com. I am thinking, why is it a security product will be sending my information to google-analytics? In other words that McAfee product doing some spying on me. They did not eliminate it, it just now the product forwards that info to their own servers. Windows allows to opt-out of such behavior, but McAfee doesn't.In conclusion, I'd say, some time ago McAfee security products did a good job. But over the past few years, the quality of protection and support is so low that it makes extremely difficult to trust McAfee with protection. It is in the bottom 20% of security products available on the market. That is what I see, unfortunately.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2019"

Amazon made an exception probably because it was so cheap and/or somebody knows something about the seller and/or product we don't and they don't want us to know either. I don't know. The whole thing turned into a major ordeal. I did not even ask for the refund but I was offered one to buy a new virus protector. It certainly will not be this one. After this I am so wary of digital products other than books so I may end up buying retail next time.( Funny..I thought retail was you pay for something and you get it...if it's defective you get your money back) I guess the definition has drastically changed in the digital age!

27,Savea,Adding to the chorus of discontented customers,"  First off, I have used McAfee for about 8 or 9 years now with no problems.  I always purchased from Amazon as a download and never had a problem until this year.  The download would not work on my new windows PC.  It got stuck in a loop around 43%.  I shut it down and tried again but it wouldn't even download onto the machine.  Luckily, a smart customer had mentioned in her review that she tried the product key and it worked liked a charm.  Well, that meant that I had to repurchase this software to get a product key.  I went to a big box store this time and got the 5 pc total protection for a great price.  I have successfully loaded the software onto 3 devices including my new windows PC.  No problems at all!  Be careful with the downloads.  I lost 18 dollars because of the download problem.  I already have a McAfee account so getting it set up to use there was not a problem.  The download just wouldn't work.

31,Dan L.,They don't tell you that you MUST give them credit card info and enroll in auto renew,"  I bought McAfee because Norton products all included auto-renewal, which I didn't want. Imagine my frustration when I discovered that before McAfee would let me activate their software, they demanded my credit card information so I could be forcibly enrolled in auto-renewal! Add the fact that my initial purchase cost $20 for one year of protection on three devices, but next year it will be at least $95.

Overall experience has been bad: for one it's not as smooth as Norton, the UI is lacking, but my biggest problem was it slows down MS Office files opening dramatically - and there is no way to turn it off. Like why it has to scan file again if it's already passed the periodical auto-scan of hard drive? And why on earth there is no easy way to add some directory as exception? Instead, McAfee asks you to add file by file, and even that doesn't work indeed.I am switching to other products, for me this is not worth it.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2020"

I've used McAfee for years; good reliability.  I would NOT recommend checking the box that allows for auto-renewal payment, as then you can't shop around for a better price (like I did here).

Beware, however, if you currently have a McAfee product that is expiring, other than ""Total Protection"", it will NOT start the renewal date from the expiration date of the current product.  Even though I had ""LiveSafe"" installed, it simply uninstalled LiveSafe and started my one year ""renewal"" of Total Protection based on its installation date, causing me to lose three weeks of extended coverage.

I finally got help with their McAFee tech support and got the installation to go through once I realized the required Serial Number was case sensitive. Secondly, once installed, the program errored out on attempting to run a full system scan.  I contacted McAfee support a second time, and the tech let me know it was a known issue with the latest version of MacOS, and that their engineering team was working on it. No known ETA on a problem that looks to be at least 2 months old, if my searching of the forums is correct.  Running a system scan is one of the main features of the antivirus software, and it doesn't work upon install.

Admittedly I don't recall seeing it in the license agreement last year. I purchased a total security for (5) downloads from Amazon on 12/20/21.  I paid for it and then went to McAfee website to install.  There were many attempts on the website to trick the customer into signing up for auto renewal because it offers no choice.I believe I was able to avoid the auto renewal with the 1st download but with the 2nd download, the only way it will allow the download is if customer agrees with the license agreement before downloading.Today, I have made several attempts to contact the company with the contact phone number listed on the website but each time the call was dropped.

72,BJ in Michigan,Takes too much memory and slows and stops the machine.,  I have two 4 GB memory lap tops and after installing the total protection I found that I cannot use the computer since it froze the computer often forcing me to force shut down and restart and to restore my files. Even when the computer worked it took for ever to open any site. Unfortunately I cannot return the product since both my machines cannot use this soft ware. It is a waste of money for me and lost time for the past one month. After a lot of struggle I found out it was not my machine but this software was the problem. Now I depend on Windows  protection. I am not a computer specialist and do not know much about these problems and so has to depend on others to help me and finally I reached out to my nephew and ask him to remotely check the problems and that is how I found out the problem I had. After removing McAffee protection I am able to use my laptops better. I may buy a new computer sometime next year if I find a good sale price with more memory and may be this soft ware will be useful. But since it is valid only for one year the amount I paid is a waste of funds for me with no possibility of return. I just bought this on Amazon on March 14th or so and installed few days later. I removed the product from the computer on 28th March.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2020"

My email and all of my information private and not were hacked. This included my pictures, writing and art work. I am without my computer because I had a feeling that my information was being compramized. I went to the police, but I didn't know who it was. I called McAfee on several occassions and always got the same two people. Both of them assured me that my computer were fine and had no viruses. After my internet was secured, I was still having security problems. I told McAfee about these problems on several occasions, but the same two people always told me that my computer was fine. When I finally realized something was not right about the McAfee people I was talking to and had the police called when I was talking to the support person  from McAfee, he hung up once I got to a public place. I told the police I thought it was McAfee.  The support person said that he was from India, and sounded like he had an Indian accent, but he didn't pronounce the H's in my email address with an Indian accent. It was a Spanish accent. So I'm not sure where he was calling from and before he hung up he also told me that if I put in one wrong number when I called McAfee I would be calling a scam number.  McAfee also did take access of my computer at one point too to ""look"" at it when I called in for security help. When I attempted to remove McAfee from my computer, it did install, but I found it on other places on my computer and it is still on my hard drive as well.

139,#1BearsFan,Such a thing as too much protection,"  Always had Norton and saw this deal so was expecting the same for less. Maybe it's how it's supposed to be with the ""Total Protection"" package but the app constantly nags you to give them information like GPS location in case your phone is lost/stolen, access to EVERYTHING, long screen locks, multiple security questions and passwords, nonstop notifications to add features and information, very high battery consumption, etc. I understand asking once but when I say no I expect it to be relegated to an option in the settings menu, not multiple and constant notifications and the main theme on the homepage. There doesn't seem to be a way to turn off the badgering. I was expecting a malware/virus check every now and again and a bit of efficient clean-up but not the case. If that's what you're looking for go for it but it's back to simplicity for this guy.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2019"

This Total Protection version was a great price, less than half of what I would have had to pay to get it directly from McAfee.

Of all the virus protection software I've had over the years this one is the worst. I don't care about the performance as a virus protector, there are higher rated protective software out there. The main problem with this is the constant McAfee ad pop ups that you can not block. I've tried disabling every pop up and still randomly in every hour to two or so it forces a pop up in the middle of what ever task I'm doing. Wither it is popping up in the middle of a gaming session, or popping up in the middle of working on a painting or rendering project, it forces me out of the project. It has repeatedly ruined hours of work and worst is occasionally it pops up in the middle of saving or rendering and corrupts the file in the process which has ruined weeks worth of work.It's almost as bad as getting most viruses, or malware. It prevents the function of your PC. Has a bad interface and it's options do nothing to prevent this. They must pay for fake reviews just to just get a 4 star rating. DO NOT BUY OR INSTALL ON YOUR PC< IF IT CAME WITH YOUR PC UNINSTALL ASAP AND REPLACE WITH A BETTER PRODUCT (WHICH WOULD BE ALMOST ANY OTHER VIRUS PROTECTION SOFTWARE OUT THERE)!!!!!!!!",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2020"
1193,biglou4sho,This program will hijack your computer. Change your search engine (even after I changed them back),"  I tried this because Norton puts you in popup hell when it comes time to renew.  This one is even worse!!  These companies have side agendas to push products onto you that you don't want.  Imagine filing your taxes and then the tax software starts signing you up for credit cards and bank accounts you don't want.I use Google Chrome.  That is the search engine I want to use.  McAfee however, wants me to use Yahoo.  They pushed that into my computer upon install.  Annoying but I went online to figure out to switch it back.So the other day Chrome started acting weird.  My screen turned white and didn't have my photo background.  Didn't think much of it at the time.  Today I noticed the little Yahoo icon in my search bar.  Sure enough, Mcafee switched me over to Yahoo (again).Mcafee is now in the same status in my opinion as a virus.  Changing things on my computer that I don't want changed.  And doing it without my knowing consent.Today is the final straw.  I have 8 more months left on Mcafee  and I am taking it off the family computers (we to the unlimited devices edition)  I get it now.

1195,Stacey Define,Not Fully Compatible with Windows 7 OR Windows 10,"  The McAfee website and product details say it's full compatible with Windows 7 SP1, but it's not. I wanted to put it on an older machine that I didn't want to update to Windows 10 and it wouldn't install. Customer service tried their best, but couldn't do it. Customer service also told me Windows 7 isn't full compatible, which isn't what the McAfee and product description says. They suggested updating to Windows 10. So, I did. And guess what? It won't install on that same machine with Windows 10, either. All the PC specs meet the minimum requirements  (by far) listed on the McAfee website and product description on Amazon. My wild guess is there's something about the old Dell (originally Vista) that doesn't jive with McAfee for whatever reason. I don't see a refund button for this software purchase, so I guess I'll have to call and complain to get my money back?Note: Windows 10 comes with pretty good anti-virus build in (Defender), so adding McAfee would seemingly do very little. The irony is McAfee wasn't compatible with the Windows OS that could have really benefited from it.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2020"
1196,Luz Rosario,Firewall Blocks spawned exe's without logging & no longer supports Folder exclusion (wildcards).,"  McAfee has dumbed down the product and taken away two extremely important features from their AV and Firewall, which basically makes it such a burden that it is unusable for some developers or IT folks.The Firewall and AV Scanner no longer support Folder exclusion or use of wildcards.  It only allows individual file exceptions.Also, the firewall does not allow exceptions for programs spawned by those already in the exception list.  I don't know if this consumer product allowed that feature in the past; but their business products did.It also does not log the blocking of the programs (spawned exe); the application you are using just locks up- until you disable the McAfee firewall.I would steer way clear of this product unless you enjoy wasting time and being frustrated.I bought the 10 user version of McAfee Total Protection from dell and am trying to return it.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2020"
1197,Ronnie victor Chibuike,Auto renewal,"  I bought a new Windows computer directly from HP.  It came with McAfee trial. No problems and no issues to date, except that by trial expired and they wanted me to renew. So I could either use my Kaspersky sub for 3 devices (it expires in June), or I could try this to see if I liked.  So, wanting to try new, I clicked to download McAfee. This is when I lost it. McAfee force me to auto-renew. I can cancel the auto-renew if I change the payment method in the future. This means that if I click Yes, I am essentially stuck with them.  They can protest and say it isn't so, but it would be so much easier if they didn't force the user in to auto-renew. I therefore decided to go with Kaspersky. Does Kaspersky do the same. The last time I bought a sub, they didn't, but maybe all of them will try to push the envelope. My suggestion: push back.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2020"
1198,V.V.,Not recommended,"  I didn't purchase McAfee, it came loaded as a trial on Windows 10 with my Dell XPS and also on my Samsung Galaxy S9+ phone. It never worked on either so what can I say if preloaded software doesn't work with the phone/laptop it came loaded on? You would think they would check that before shipping it out but this is the way of the American Corporation these days it seems. I could not activate it on my phone though I kept on pressing the Activate button in Settings. It doesn't seem I'm able to completely remove it from my phone either. Then I purchased a Dell laptop. It was on there too. It kept on turning off and though I selected it it would not activate on the laptop so I finally removed it as every time I started up the computer I would get an error message from McAfee telling me my firewall was off. I could not get it to turn on with the button in Settings on the laptop either. Just a crappy piece of software as it doesn't appear to work with anything.

1199,sharon Lenczewski,"Secure, But Overdrive","  There honestly can be a real difference with getting the right and the wrong piece of software. There are some security softwares that can easily protect your computer from damages, and others that can actually make damages. In the case with antivirus software, I have learned over the years that it isn't the best thing to get one based on a brand name. It actually depends on the services that you need and the ones that only can slow you down. I have known McAfee as one of the leading brands in security software. They say that they can protect you from just about anything. Well, why do they make software that can only cost you more for your wallet. McAfee's Total Protection software claims that it can protect you from any damage on your computer. While it does do a good job, it sadly can be a drag on your computer, because it can easily clog up and take a lot of space on your hard drive. It isn't very good if you have a cloud computer, or one that has a solid state drive. I think it works good, but it does eat up your computer space. I do recommend instead that you do seek another brand name like BitDefender or Kaspersky instead if that is the issue.Price: C+Convenience & Setup: COverall: C 1/2+",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2018"

Some guy who said his name was Henry tried to scam me out of $150, said my 2 hours brand new out of the box MacBook Pro was infected and then gave me a number for me to call him back on tomorrow!I called Apple Care instead and while waiting for them installed Malwarebytes and no infection.  I searched the number “Nick Parker” gave me (Henry morphed into Nick  with the new number) and there were over 200 complaints.  The number which popped up on the McAfee site has numerous complaints as well.Why McAfee outsourced this is anyone's guess, but it is a huge mistake.Do not purchase.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2020"

So how do they get this renewal price ($103.06) which auto defaulted to the  ""on"" option  when buying on Amazon? Also I had my bank debit changed since I purchased the product and they managed to get my new debit card number from my bank so they could charge me again for a rip off renewal price! Beware of this when if you make the mistake in purchasing this product. Been on hold (with MacAfee) trying to call them now for 2 hrs. no pick up of course.  Stay away!

Normally, it will prompt you whether you want to change to secure search, but sometimes it just changes it without consent.  This is especially frustrating when you are trying to support multiple devices in a family and not all of them understand the intracies of browser settings.  Also, when you try to end your subscription or remove a payment online, it makes all kinds of misleading statements with scare tactics about removing antivirus.

Second year auto renew, and they try to rip me off by charging $350. They want you to download a program off of  helpservice.us Stay as far away as possible. I've tried emails to cancel, but was explained in broken English that they can't do it that way, I have to download site, that even their program blocks. I've explained time and again why I don't want the renewal. After brain tumor surgery, I can hardly use the comp at all. Can't believe that McAfee would rip people off. Read the other reviews.

That did not happen and since it’s been a month I can’t get my money back from my bank.While using my computer the next day I tried to close an app but it kept saying someone was using the app and closing it would cause them to lose all of their unsaved information. I forced closed anyway. I tried to shut down the computer and again it told me someone was using it.I finally called the IT department for the firm I work for and she took it over..

I think after using the product, it should be up to the customer to renew if they want to or not. In this case McAfee will bill you 89.00 (listed as current price) upon renewal. Scam!I spent may hours with their support group with no resolution:McAfee stated: Service Request '# 1-78231601 has been resolved' this is NOT true.I asked McAfee to: Kindly do NOT renewI do not want to be automatically renewedI have removed McAfee from my device and took the lose, and I will never purchase any McAfee products.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2022"

1343,M. Huck,VERY slow to react to a new threat.,"  I used McAfee for about 5 years until I got hit with a very nasty ransom-ware. I was able to clear it by using the internet on another computer but when I researched it, that particular ransom-ware had been in the wild for more than a month. EVERY OTHER VIRUS SOFTWARE HAD ALREADY UPDATED THEIR PATTERNS FOR THIS VIRUS so it would not have been an issue except for using McAfee. A week later, McAfee finally sent an update to filter for the virus. They also finally posted instructions on how to deal with it - which the other companies had posted a month before.When you pay for virus protection, you should be paying for an active R&D team that has a response that is better than 1 month+, hopefully hours or a few days at most. The time I lost dealing with this was worth more than the cost of the software.I have been using AVG since then and have never had an issue.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 14, 2022"
