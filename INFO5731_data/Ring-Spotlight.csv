0,ArikB,"Very Good Security Camera, Please Read If Discouraged by Other Avg. Reviews","  I read many of the reviews and almost did not purchase the camera because of them. However, after making the decision to buy two and using them for the past 3 weeks, I have been very pleased. Prior to my purchase I owned a RING doorbell, and since I have purchased a RING floodlight cam. All of my cameras work extremely well.I wanted to address the comments some people are making about these cameras as I think they are a little inaccurate. The battery life is not poor. I have two cameras on the back of my house and they ran on the original battery for 3 weeks. To ease concerns about poor battery life, I have had my cameras set on the standard motion detection setting and 3 weeks is pretty good. Additionally, each camera holds two batteries so ideally you can get up to 6 weeks without changing the batteries at all. We have a lot of deers, rabbits, etc in addition to our dog so our motions probably go off more than the average household.As far as video quality, these work well at night and in the day. I watch my kids in our backyard when they walk the dog at night, and I'm able to see them fine. If you want high def like watching a movie then sure, the video quality is not up to that standard. However, if you want to see if anyone is trying to break into your house or simply monitor your yard when you're home or not at home, it is perfectly fine.In terms of motion sensitivity, there are two settings that allow you to control the sensitivity. I think some of the reviews were a little misleading and perhaps they did not familiarize themselves with the app. There is a setting that basically lets you set the motion distance from the camera that you will pick up alerts. There is also an additional setting that let's you change the sensitivty with three settings that are equivalent to a high, standard, and low. I find these work just as well as my Ring floodlight.At the end of the day if you want all of your cameras to be in the same product family, or you just want to install some motion lights with the hassle of having to get a hard power line to them, I think these are great. Installation only took me about 15-20 minutes per camera, and part of that was adjusting the field of view of the cameras to my liking.I would highly recommend these cameras.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2018"
1,Michael,"Super Easy to Install, no wires necessary!","  I have a Ring pro on my front door and loved it so much that I wanted something for the back patio since I have contracts (lawn, pool, trees, etc) in my backyard. My challenge however is that all the walls on the patio are either stucco or rock, which makes it near impossible to run a hidden power line.  So I opted for this option and so far it works great. The lights are pretty bright and the motion detection works as expected.As for the battery life, it has been in for a couple weeks and it has lost about 10% battery. So I’m guessing it will last about 3 months before it needs a charge. I just ordered a second battery which should double that battery life.The connection is very quick, it seems to connect much faster than my front door, but in fairness it is closer to the wireless router.As for installation, I installed it using the provided screws into the frame of my patio door. It actually works perfect there because you can’t really see it and allows me to perfectly position it for motion detection.My only complaint is the motion zone setup. Unlike the ring pro where I can “draw” motion zones (which significantly helps reduce motion alerts), it only allows you to specify a distance. It really isn’t very intuitive, so I just leave it at mid-range and it seems to work just fine for now.Beware, in order to have video playback, you do have to subscribe to the ring premium service. And you have to have a subscription per device! I have it for my front door, not sure I’m gonna pay for the back door. That was kind of a bummer to find out I’d have to pay more. It should be a household subscription.Overall, I’m very happy with the device and would recommend it to anyone looking for an easy to install solution without wires.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2018"

   Wow!  I had no idea so much happens outside my front door!  We've captured deer, birds building nests in my door wreath, a fox trying to get in the front door and even raccoons and stray cats wandering on our front porch, not to mention our guests whom I can speak to from other locations. If someone is up to no good, I can sound the alarm from my cell phone. We also can monitor the live feed from our Alexa. We upgraded and purchased the yearly subscription to save all our videos.  With two batteries it lasts well over a month of charge.  This camera works great and is very responsive. The angle of recording is large enough to capture almost 180.  We purchased a second camera to cover our pool and added solar panels to keep it charged. It is great at capturing motion before anyone gets even close to the pool. Great when you have little ones or pets who somehow always find ways to go where they're not suppose to.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2018"
3,Donna,"Inaccurate at times, but still workable","  I've previously owned Arlo security cameras, and I have both Ring security cameras and Arlo cameras at my house. My Ring cams don't connect to my WiFi router consistently, so I was advised to buy a ring WiFi extender. The Arlo base device seems to be more consistent with WiFi connections. On the Ring mobile app, it doesn't provide thumbnail image previews like Arlo, and the app crashes a lot because it can't connect to my cloud account. Live view on the Ring app does not always work and sometimes all I get is a black screen on the mobile app. As a result, the ring cam itself does not always do what you want it to do. It does have some good features, like the LED lights, motion snooze modes, motion proximity settings, and double battery packs, but I'm sticking primarily with Arlo until Ring upgrades their mobile app.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2018"
4,LGG,The camera didn’t work very well at all. When ...,"  The camera didn’t work very well at all. When I had the motion sensor turned up, it would pick people up in my yard sometimes, however it would also pick up cars driving by on my road. When I turned the motion settings down a little to avoid the road, it wouldn’t detect anyone in my yard. It picked up vehicles alright, but not people very well. I did spend quite a bit of time messing with the settings trying to get it to work with no success. I gave up and sent the Ring camera back to Amazon.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2018"
5,Jamie,"Inferior to Arlo, I'll give it a little more time","  So, got this battery model to see if it would work as well as my Arlo Pro 2; the battery in my Arlo is dying after 6 months, and they are expensive, so I thought I would try this cam. I have the ring pro doorbell, which works fine, and the Ring Home security system, which works fine as well, so I thought I would keep the cams ""in the family""..So far, totally disappointed...I have a very strong wifi signal all over my property, and, in spite of this, I am having the same issues many others have reported; black screen when you go to view videos, either live view, or motion detected views, and, the motion sensing view part of the software is ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS, meaning that if you actually get a motion event with a video that will show up on your screen, it NEVER has the actual motion event there, it shows you several seconds AFTER the motion triggering event occurs..who the hell was the software engineer on this project???I've been in contact with ring support, they are sending me out a replacement cam to try, but, after reading more reviews on the internet about this thing, these problems seem to occur very frequently, which, is horrible for a company with the reputation like Ring; Amazon owns this company now, and they should be ashamed to put a non functioning item like this out on the market.I'll see if the replacement works any better, but based on the reviews here, I doubt it..I'll update the review when I install the replacement, but at this point, I would say AVOID THIS ITEM!",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2018"
6,M. Wasserman,I looked at several cameras and I liked the concept of the Ring cameras and what they ...,"  I had high hopes and expectations for Ring products but so far I've been extremely let down.  I looked at several cameras and I liked the concept of the Ring cameras and what they had to offer for my needs.  So I just threw caution to the wind and invested in several to build a multi-camera system (3 Spotlight Cams ( w/2 batteries and Solar Panel ea) plus a Floodlight Cam.  In hindsight that alone was a mistake because of not knowing how they were going to work for sure.  Didn't get them up right away and that prevented me from being able to return them.  Had to change to a new cell carrier and internet service just to have enough speeds for the cameras to work.  And I still had to invest in 2 Ring Chime Pros to get a decent signal to them.  SO I have invested a fair amount in Ring and am STUCK with Ring for now (1,100 plus dollars__BIG MISTAKE).  I wanted one more Ring camera but that's indefinitely put on hold...( looking at Nest cameras right now...maybe they can do better)  Maybe it's their turn now...Ring has had theirs and is failing at this point.  Competition leads to better products anyway right.The lag and slow response times, inconsistent less than stellar video quality, flat out failures and too many more to list so I'll stop there. It's falling flat before it's really out of the gate.  At least for me it is.  Now whether some of these issues are related to the app...who knows.  And regarding tweaking things,  that's fine IF it's a one time thing but if these systems are so sensitive to things or certain hardware etc then this becomes like a house of cards...one thing slips out of place and the whole thing comes down.  I don't have time to be part of the R&D team.  If that's the case I'd be better off with ADT or Xfinity security monitoring.My speeds are solid, my camera/signal health is good. My cell service is a nationwide top end service so at this point my commitment to Ring is fading fast and that window is closing.  With Jeff Bezos and Amazon behind Ring I really expected better than this.  I'm a Amazon Prime member and Amazon has never let me down...so this is really frustrating and disappointingAt this point these cameras are useless to me as a security/monitoring device.  A novelty at best...and that is when they work consistently.I really would like for this to work and I'm sure somewhere in there is a good product line but so far for me I'm not impressed and couldn't recommend Ring Products for what they are marketed to do",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2018"
7,SLH,Not worth $199 - UPDATE,"  UPDATE From previous review below:  I'm now downgrading my review from 2 stars to 1.  Why?  Well, I was reached out to from Ring about my problems and they were initially very helpful.  Even replaced my ""Battery operated"" camera for a ""Wired one"" saying it would give me better reliability.  Well after only 3 weeks, the microphone stoped working so I couldn't communicate with visitors at my door - only see them.  So I once again reached out to Ring, only this time they kept going round and round with me for a month asking silly questions about my wifi, wifi extender, what's my pnone, have you tried on you computer, on and on and on.  They simply wouldn't accept that their camera's microphone was busted on this 3 week old device.  So I just gave up and told them never mind.  It was infuriating.  So, for my initial $199 purchace, Ive simply got a camera that does nothing else.  Big deal!  It's 2019.  Terrible service!Ok, I've waited almost two months before writing a review on this camera.  I wanted SOOOO Much to like it, but I'm afraid I can't.  I've adjusted locations several times, played with ALL the range, sensitivity and quadrant options.  I even bought a wifi extender to make sure the camera had enough ""juice"".  Well, after months of ""false notifications, spotty alerts, etc.  I cannot recommend this product.  Perhaps my BIGGEST problem with it is the lag in notifying me when there really IS someone coming up our driveway.  By the time I get a ""alert"" on my phone, the person has already driven up, gotten out of their car AND is already at my front door - from the motion of their car driving up about 20 seconds earlier!  Someone could easily steal a package from my front door and be off before I even get an alert.  So sorry Amazon, you bought a company that could be a lot better in my opinion.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2018"
8,Hickorybro,Great Camera. Works well for the backyard.,  We have this camera for the backyard and also the ring doorbell for the front door. We got the doorbell first and think it does the job. It is not the best nor is it the worst. Now the camera for the backyard is very nice. We got it as a safety precaution because we felt someone had used the pool while we were away and did not want that to be a safety issue.  As you can see in these live pictures I just took that it covers pretty much the whole yard and you can zoom into areas on the app with your finger. Also pictured. We have the sensor set Just right to capture the movement in the backyard. At night when motion is detected the lights fire up to record. There is also an option to push an alarm on the light. It’s not super loud but loud enough for the neighbors to hear and scare persons away. I have also included a screenshot of the app view of the ring items we have.I would recommend this camera but really recommend using the solar panel with the camera and not have to worry about taking the battery out to charge it.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2018"

   Update:  Ring customer service incessantly emails me regarding my overall rating of this product.  They want to help me like it.  I don't think they really understand what I don't like about it - the lack of features I want.  How can they help me add features to this product that it doesn't have?Anyway, they want me to mount the camera under my garage eaves and then tilt it down further closer to my garage.  The problem with that is that: 1. My garage barely has any clearance for a small SUV.  If a larger SUV or Truck tried to park in the garage with the camera under the eaves, there would not be enough clearance, and the camera and/or vehicle would be damaged.  2. If the camera were positioned the way they want me to position it there is no way it could capture activity on my driveway AND the driveways of the neighbors on either side of me.I bought a second battery (it holds 2 batteries) and a Ring Chime Pro (to extend my wifi) to go with this.This was the easiest thing to set up and install.  Great instructions and fast and easy!I have the Ring doorbell in the front, and I put this in the back at my driveway.  I attached it to the wall above my garage - see photos.  It looks good and works fairly well.  The videos are clear. It has no trouble picking up my wifi.The motion zone settings need improvement.  Unlike other cameras, it only lets you choose a distance range that goes out in a semi-circle from the camera.  I would rather draw my own range.  In my situation I would like a rectangle going sideways that ends at the street, but that is not a choice.A problem this cam has is that it will sense motion and miss the initial motion or not record motion right after.What I love about this one is that you don't have to have it on a wired power line.  I love how it can be battery powered an solar powered.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2018"

   I was honestly looking forward to getting this camera for my home, but don't make the same mistake I did. I have had issues with this camera from the moment it went up, and the support from Ring only made things more frustrating. From the start...the package is great - it comes with everything you need...even the drill bit! The battery took a few hours to charge, but never indicated it was done charging - even though it was 100% when I put it in the camera. After 24 hours, the battery was reduced by 1%, so don't expect it to last 6 months or as long as Ring suggests it will. The battery is not secured and can be easily stolen (Ring will only cover it up to a year). I was a little shocked it was so easy to get to.Getting the camera setup with the app was fairly simple and easy to do. Connecting to the camera after that was a gamble. Sometimes I could connect, sometimes I couldn't. Sometimes the wi-fi signal was OK, sometimes it was poor. And by the way, the device was located about 20 feet from the wireless router. Pretty much every other device has a perfect signal where the camera is located, including an old IP camera I had there for 5+ years.Night one - 47 degrees outside, and condensation forms over the camera lens completely (see the image and video). This was never an issue with the old camera (not a Ring product), so I contact Ring Support to see what's up. After a 45 minute wait, Ring support suggested I wipe the lens. Clearly, this is not something I would have thought of myself?!? After taking a few deep breaths and explaining I did that, the next suggestion was to move the camera. The weather doesn't change a few feet away, so this was the most asinine of suggestions I received. The next solution was to wait for warmer weather. I am not kidding. Ring support suggested I wait for warmer weather. Finally, we looped back to relocating the camera. At that point, I just had to shake my head and laugh.I am returning this camera to Amazon and hope it gets destroyed. Do yourself a favor - DO NOT BUY THIS CAMREA. You'll regret it eventually.Update...One day after this review was posted, Ring contacted me (two different people) and wanted the opportunity to speak with me more. I was pretty much done with Ring, as you can gather from this review, but I agreed anyhow. A few hours later, I was on the phone with someone at the Ring offices. My experience this time was completely different. They didn't offer excuses or make absurd recommendations. To make a long story short, I gave them a second chance with a different camera. Actually, I was so hopeful after this, I now have two Ring devices (Doorbell Pro and Floodlight). Don't get me wrong, the battery camera is indeed horrible and I would never recommend it. I'll be leaving reviews on the other two devices, but they are much better in every way.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2018"
11,Avid Reader,Wireless Freedom - Ring Cam Battery,"  Love the freedom of wireless, the solar panels work great and only need a couple of hours of sunlight per day to keep the batteries topped off. Video quality is great and I've got eyes on the whole yard now. Just picked up 3 of these beauties. Simply system anyone can install and operate. Thank You Ring!!I bought a camera system a few years ago with a hard drive a 4 wired cameras. Wires all over the house and you need a PHD in programming to get the system to work.

13,Shay,Very Poor Quality,"  The Ring doorbell is great! The Ring camera is a cheap piece of junk. Yes, the picture is terrific quality - when it works. I have a very good wifi system and this thing cannot stay connected to it. I have no problem with my Nest cameras operating on the same system. Ring said I needed their Ring extender...so I bought it. $40.00 of cheap plastic with two dopey antennas. Even when placed midway in the line of sight with my main system....it still reported low signal. This is not what you want when you are trying to protect your home remotely.OH, and I had to return it once already because the battery compartment would not stay shut (cheap plastic). If the compartment does not snap shut...the camera does not work. And the universal ball mounting bracket will never hold the camera in place through an afternoon summer squall.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 28, 2018"
14,Shay,Only sensed motion about 30% of the time. Had ...,  Update 5/21/2020 a Ring rep eventually contacted me after this review and worked with me on finding another Ring product to fit our needs.  They sent us the ring doorbell.  We installed it and have been using it for about 10 months now.  It’s worked really well for us.  So 5 stars for the customer service that made sure we had a product that worked well for us and our needs!Only sensed motion about 30% of the time.  Had multiple boxes delivered one day and it didn’t pick up motion from any of the delivery people.  Ridiculous.

15,Daim,"USELESS: Recently updated App, makes motion sensor & cameras useless","  We have been happy with our 3 Ring cameras for a little over a year. We loved the custom ability provided with the motion sensors. In Sept 2019 they updated their app and took away ALL motion customization.It might not effect a home that is near a street, but for our home it no longer detects when anyone comes up to the house until AFTER they reach the door. So, they ring our normal doorbell BEFORE the Ring lets us know they are on our property.We loved that we were alerted when people pulled up to the home. With two adopted special needs children it gave us plenty of time to wrap up what we are doing to get to the door before deliveries were missed, or people are standing around. We also had plenty of time to answer the notice and speak to the person.Not anymore! :( Worse thing is they made the change. Shortened the distance the Ring detects, all without notifying us.How did we find out? Our neighbor was robbed and the guy walked right in front of the Ring and it DIDN’T pick him up at all. He was caught from a distance on other cameras standing only a few feet from the Ring and it NEVER detected him. We have everything set to high alert, super sensitive. The only thing that changed was their motion sensor customization.They made the change to save storage and money. So, their company could bring in higher profits at the customers expense.Our kids and family is less safe, all because someone somewhere decided we no longer needed motion sensor customization. Even though they still advertise it here as a product feature.Looking for an alternative. These cameras are now useless.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2019"
16,Daim,You're better off with the wired cam,"  I have 3 Ring wired spotlight cams and wanted to put another camera in a spot that running a wire would be less convenient so I figured I would just go with the battery cam with the solar panel.  The solar panel works great, it keeps the battery at 100% even with only a few hours of full direct sunlight.  The first camera I received didn't work and after a few hours with the Ring CS, they decided it needed to be replaced. No big deal, things like this happen and they are easy to deal with for the replacement.  The second camera works  but not as good as the wired ones do.  First the motion settings are no where as detailed as the wired cam has.  The wired cam I can draw out the zone I want the camera to activate and that's perfect.  The battery spotlight cam doesn't do this.  The only motion setting available is the range so because of that I get too many alerts that I don't need to be getting.  The picture quality on this battery cam is also not as good as the wired cam either. With the wired camera you can turn it off for the times that you expect a lot of traffic in that area. Then you don't have to go back and delete all those captures of the kids playing or you washing your car.  The battery cam has no way to turn it off so I have to go back and delete, delete, delete.  At some point I'm going to have to replace this camera with the wired camera.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2018"
17,Christopher Tarpey,Best Security Cam Functionality at This Price Point,"  First, full disclosure. I have no involvement with any product and receive no compensation for my views. I'm basically a tech-junkie and love home automation products and services.I did a lot of research on security camera functions and features before buying and installing a RING solution. I looked extensively at Ring, Nest, Arlo, D-Link, Blink and TP-Link with an eye towards 1) creating a multi-tiered security solution and 2) giving me the ability to watch over both my home/family and both of my elderly in-laws homes. The functions and features I evaluated included, (not an exhaustive list) doorbell function, two way communication via the camera, alarm capability, manual and scheduled lighting control,  motion-detecting lighting control, security camera resolution (1080p) , night vision, accuracy of and variability in motion-sensing zones, wireless capability and range, live view from cameras, stored and recorded video from cameras, both battery operated AND hard wired power source, battery life, ease of setup and maintenance, compatibility with ALEXA, and solar charging capability for battery operated systems.Everyone is going to have their own opinion on each of these brands and the importance of the functions evaluated, but for me, Ring won out in most (almost all) categories.  Arlo would have been my second choice. It missed the mark in a just a few areas, whereas the Ring products seemed to provide just about everything I wanted across the product line and provided some features and functions that just blew me away.Even 6 months after installing 2 Doorbell Pros (wired), 3 Indoor cameras, 3 Floodlight Cams (wired), and 3 Spotlight Cams (2-battery/solar charged) on three different properties, and linking them into my Ring Account and  Alexa environment, the system still works almost flawlessly and keeps both me and my wife fully informed about what's going on around our house, at her parent's home and at their vacation home. When someone comes to the door at the in-law's place, we both get an 'alarm' on our phones and via Alexa indicating that someone has rung the doorbell at their house, which then allows us to open the Ring app and 'answer the door' for them because they can't get down the stairs to the door as quickly as they used to. (We gave them an Echo Show to answer the door with, but unfortunately, remembering the phrase, ""Alexa, show me the Front Door camera"" seems to be beyond capability on some days.  It works great when they can remember it though...)The Ring Spotlight and Floodlight cams will turn on the lights at night when someone comes into the motion-sensing 'view' of the cameras. If I'm wondering who (or what) it might be, the security light is sufficient to light the area in color at 1080p resolution (at night!).  If I want to look at a secured area in a low-light situation, the night-vision cameras give a good enough resolution to let me see my cars, the bushes, wild animals (we live in a wooded area), our cats, and just about everything else.Speaking of the cats...  That is the ONLY complaint I have about any of the Ring products.  The motion-sensing controls are supposed to be adjustable so that the camera will be able to distinguish between small animals and humans at anywhere from 3 to 30 ft. away, but despite trying several settings, focal lengths and angles, none of the cameras seem to be able to tell the difference between a moving 3lb  cat and a 150lb person, let alone a flag or a bush moving in a light breeze.  I'm sure the technology exists to do this accurately...  whether we would be willing to pay the added price might be the real issue.  Until they get that worked out, I just turn off the 'motion alerts' for cameras where I know I'm going to get constant alerts and leave the 'light alerts' on, so if it is a person, they know they've been seen.  The cats, dogs and bears... they couldn't care less.  Turning on a light due to movement burns more battery, but the solar panels always seem to bring the power back quickly to 100% even on cloudy days, so it hasn't been much of an issue.My wife and I also like that all video (with audio) is recorded and stored in the Cloud (added cost feature, but well worth it and not that expensive in my view). She finds it comforting to know that her parents have gotten back home from their daily outing and made it safely back in the house in real time, but she can also check on the history of who has come and gone at any time, day or night.  Did their grocery delivery come today as scheduled?  Ring can tell her.If you have a second home in another state, as long as you leave the electricity on and internet access available,  you can monitor the place inside and out from wherever you are, turn on and off security lighting, talk to 'visitors', record any activity, and set off an alarm if necessary. It's the poor man's version of 24/7 monitored security.If you have simpler needs or are just starting out with home automation/home security I still believe Ring is a great choice for a starter, and it's easily expandable. Just taking security camera solutions into consideration, Ring does everything that the others do and provides some features that others simply don't, like the built-in motion-enabled security spotlight or floodlight, or the free replacement guarantee if one of your cameras gets stolen.  Expanding the scope into other capabilities, Arlo didn't get to 1080p until Arlo Pro 2, only recently came out with a security doorbell, and their cameras still don't have security lights.  And Arlo, in many cases, is just more expensive than Ring.The only 2 things Arlo Pro 2 can do that Ring cannot are 1) record 24/7; and that will only happen with a wired camera, not a battery operated version, and 2) store video to a USB storage target. But since I am not using these security cameras in a traditional security setup, I don't care. (In a traditional security setup, multiple cameras do 24/7 recording to a computer system that stores multi-track video for a set period of time.  If that is what you need, you either have to go with Arlo or a dedicated security cam setup.Bottom line: Both Ring and Arlo are capable solutions. As an overall security package, nothing else even came close.  For me, Ring edges out Arlo as an 'entire package' because I wanted something that had a doorbell option and security lighting included. (Arlo's doorbell is a recent offering, but their cameras still lack lighting) The 'free replacement if stolen' guarantee and the Ring Community put them over the top in my estimate. (The Ring Community allows Ring owners in a common geographic area to share captured video to ask questions about events, warn people about various situations or just show funny stuff caught on camera.  No owner or their exact location is identified, although a map of the general area is provided to orient yourself to the events being reported.Ring is fully functional, continually growing and expanding its product line in really useful ways, it's competitive in cost, and easily expandable.  And, Ring is owned by Amazon, which really can't hurt its future competitiveness.  For me, Ring was a natural choice.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2019"
18,Steve Thompson,"30 second videos, that's it!","  How is this not a known thing? 30 seconds of recording followed by a lengthy period of time before the next recording! The only way to record longer is to be in live view! So it will record someone coming up your driveway or on your porch,but not what happens if they stay there. I set it up in my driveway to keep an eye on my cars....well I was at the end of my driveway taking out the trash,which it recorded for 30 seconds, to far away to see anything other than the shape of a person...then walked up my driveway, got in my car,started it and drove away....not a single part of that was recorded!  Today I pulled in my driveway, it started recording, stayed in my car for 15 seconds, it stopped recording, I legit walked up to it,picked it up and carried it around my deck for 3 minutes before it sent me another notification about motion,zero video of me getting out of the car or picking the camera up and walking around with it.....the only possible way to make the video record for more than 30 seconds is to open the live feed in the app within the 30 seconds of the initial motion detection! So if it's 4am,someone walks up your driveway and you sleep through the notification, you have 30 seconds of video! If your in a pool on vacation obviously without your phone,you have 30 seconds of video! If someone is breaking into your home and you go get something to protect yourself instead of opening the app and going to live feed you have 30 seconds of video...then nothing, no video,no audio,no more alerts for a few minutes! If you pull in your driveway, walk in your home,check your mail,take out your trash the cameras have already recorded at least 10 seconds,you get the notifications but know that it is you activating them.......but,someone is 20 seconds behind you.....there is no video,no audio, no alerts.....nothing! This is not a security camera! It gives a false sense of security just because it has live view and alerts!",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2019"
19,Katrina,Very poor motion detection and lacks options of other brands/models,"  I was very disappointed in this product.  I bought it as I loved that it was wireless and had a companion solar panel (which worked great) to avoid having to hassle with taking batteries out to recharge.Unfortunately the camera just didn't work well for several reasons.1.  It constantly sent motion alerts from cars in the street driving by (30 or so feet away).  Even setting the motion zone to the smallest possible option this still happened.2.  On top of that it often failed to send alerts from us walking right in front of it or visitors coming up to the door.3.  It has very limited options for customizing the motion zones.  You cannot create custom shape zones like you can on many other motion cameras.  All you can do is turn any of the 3 zones off independently and use a slider to adjust how far out the zones go (which, as above, doesn't work well or stop false alarms from cars at the edge of it's range).",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2018"
20,YogaDesires,Great product for any home!,"  I definitely like this product overall as well as the ring doorbell 2 we have. However it does intermittently not work as it’s supposed to. Light won’t turn on at night when someone walks by it or when you disable the unit for a certain time you choose, the lights WILL turn on. Overall satisfied though and love this addition to our doorbell.

21,Coastal,Only records for 30 seconds! Then 50 seconds of no recording,"  I feel compelled to write a review based on my experience with the ring spotlight camera.  I bought this camera because it is battery powered and recorded at 1080p.  I owned the ring doorbell for almost a year before buying two of these spotlight cameras and really liked how the ring doorbell functioned.  There are three things that caused me to rate the ring spotlight camera two stars:1) the battery life is not what is advertised.  My two batteries in each camera last at best three weeks.  I live in a cul de sac so there isn't hardly any foot traffic or cars driving by but the batteries drain fast.  There is an option to not record every motion but I find that defeats the purpose of having a surveillance camera.2) the camera doesn't record some movements, I'm not talking about a small animal, I mean HUGE objects like when the trash truck pulls up to empty the trash cans.  I find this to be completely unacceptable.  It happens all the time.3) the ring spotlight camera only records for 30 seconds!  I called ring support because I was missing some critical video recording segments.  Motion would activate the camera and it would record for 30 seconds, then stop recording.  If the motion continued it wouldn't record again until 50 seconds had passed!!!!!  Then if there is motion it will record again for 30 seconds then no recording again for 50 seconds!  Imagine if someone is breaking into your car/house?!?!!!  That is crazy that the ring spotlight camera is like this.  The ring representative I spoke with said there was no way to adjust the record times on this camera.  I invested a lot of money into ring cameras but I am going to look into another camera that is continuous recording.  No point in having a camera that doesn't capture data, especially when motion is happening.  I recommend another camera if you are serious about security.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2019"
22,J.

There was definitely a learning curve in optimizing the wifi signal strength and the purchase of a second Ring Chime Pro (I already had a video Door Bell 2 and a Chime Pro.)

26,Customer ,Spotlight Cam a Disapointing Ring Product - Update 20 July 2019,"  Purchased the Ring Doorbell (wired) and the Spotlight Cam (outfitted with two batteries) on February 26, 2019. I found, after installing and setup, the Cam is not the same technology as the Ring Doorbell. Spotlight Cam shared the same wireless connection to the same ATT router as the Ring Doorbell. Ring Doorbell responds flawlessly. Spotlight cam is the same wireless distance as the doorbell but has connected only intermittently from day one. Added ATT Mesh Network to increase signal strength to minimize drop out. I even added a Net-Gear Extender. Every device in my house benefitted from the additions with one exception- - -the Spotlight cam.  After being ""on-line"" for less than 60 days, but beyond the 30 day return, The Spotlight Cam finally Gave up the Ghost. It went into an off-line mode and has been in that state ever since. I have implemented ALL the recovery steps recommended by Ring but this product is dead as a doornail. The Doorbell? It's still working flawlessly. The Spotlight Cam? Makes a great paper-weight but I would not recommend the Spotlight Cam as a security cam. I am currently researching other products to replace it.This in an update on the above review: After a number of email conversations with the Ring Support Team, the decision was made by the team to replace my camera under warranty, Although it took some effort to get to that point, once the they made that decision the continuing support was fast and efficient. The replacement camera came immediately. The replacement camera connected to my network with no issues and is working with no operational issues. As a suggestion for those thinking about purchasing the battery version as I did, I would add the solar option in addition as I found that if you intend to use all the options the camera provides, the battery life is decreased. Also, the latch that holds the hinged battery cover is a little flimsy and does not want to snap closed easily. Although it does work, I feel the less you have to open and close it the better. The customer support follow-up was top notch. I gave the product 4 out of 5 stars because of the cover latch issue. If ring can improve that I  would give it the full 5 stars.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2019"
27,Barry,Live video signal never appears while people are there.,"  These Ring products really have potential. If they did what they claim they do, I’d be a happy camper. I have the Ring Pro doorbell, the Ring Battery Stick Cam for indoor use, and the Ring Battery Spotlight camera (which was an Amazon Treasure Truck deal). My main complaint is right there in my Subject line. These cameras are so slow to produce a live video on whatever device you’re using (I’m using an iPhone XS Max). Without going through all of the hooops and jumps that their tech support always does (and they always say, “Well golly gee whiz, I’m so surprised you’re having these issues. We rarely have anyone call with the type of issues you’re experiencing”. I hope they get paid well to say that, because it’s just not the truth. Go see for yourself and ask ANYONE who has Ring Video systems inside or outside their house. Ask them how long it takes after someone rings their doorbell until they have a live video of the front door. What you will hear is, “The people are gone by the time it turns on”, or you will hear, “It connects, but the picture is all pixelated and you can’t see OR hear what’s being said. I’ve had it with this system and I hope you read this before buying., Do your research and find out what a good system is (there are tons of them now). I can’t recommend one because I think they will delete my review for naming another product (that they sell on Amazon). The amazingly poor performance of these Ring products is pretty shocking, considering that I put a decent amount of money into this whole system so that I could have the “ring of protection”. Ring has tried to blame the issues on everything under the sun, but what they don’t know is that they are talking to a tech repair guy. I know what a real fix is and what a phony fix is. They always try to blame your WiFi, even though the unit’s self-test says your WiFi signal is “better than 80% of Ring users”. It’s not my WiFi, it’s not my wiring (because they run on rechargeable batteries), it’s just their products. They’re poor quality and just don’t work. Once in a blue moon when I CAN get a live signal, the video signal on my iPhone XS Max is absolutely amazing. Crystal clear, and you can zoom in and out using finger gestures. They better come out with a “fix” for these ultra-poor video products or their recent billion dollar business is going to be a name in the heap of other hi-tech companies that didn’t make it either. Best of luck to you! (If you already bought one, return it and get a different brand!! Seriously, it’s THAT bad. I had a friend bring over his WiFi cams and we connected wirelessly to my home WiFi network. Not a single problem. Instant video and sound, crystal clear audio in both directions, it was fantastic and it proves (again) that it’s not anything wrong I’m doing—-it’s their products.

28,Frank L.,Update 4/17/2018:  Can't Recommend,"  It's now been about 6 months and still no software update. Don't buy.After writing my review, Ring reached out to me to discuss my concerns and to update me on their efforts to improve the camera.  It seems they are working on a future software update that WILL ALLOW video to be turned off as well as motion detection.  No date on the release, but I'm hopeful.I recently purchased and installed both the Ring Spotlight Camera with its Solar Panel.  Picture quality is good and the overall system build seems adequate.  HOWEVER, IT SUFFERS FROM A MAJOR SOFTWARE FLAW.  The ring app allows you to turn off motion detection notifications, but this does not turn off video recording.  Video is always being recorded and creating an unnecessary power drain.  I called ring tech support and asked what I should do if I wanted to have a party on our patio without the the spotlight camera recording everything.  Their only answer was to open the camera and remove the battery!  This is unsatisfactory.  There should be a software option to turn off notifications AND video recording.

I’m not kidding it was not awful, it just didn’t work. It was 100% pixelated to the max. I thought well, maybe there is too much speed and bandwidth so let me take it outside where it’s going to go anyway. It showed a picture and paused and then it again pixelated again and paused and did a speed test out side and it was 112Mbps as I ran a speed test again and the installer said he has never seen that before and just to return it. I’m so done with these security cameras. My friend lives at an apartment complex and he is friends the manager there and she showed me what a 4K quality looks like and I was blown away by how crisp and the zero lag it has. This was or is like Vegas top notch Casino level security where you can record, zoom in and see faces in real High Definition. Yes I know you can not get that kind of quality on a Ring and I get that but now I know you get what you pay for means at the highest level.

31,hiker0696,Large investment - does not work as promised.,"  Complete disappointment! Doesn't catch motion of people - ever. Catches trees blowing though! Every 30 seconds it triggers the camera and then records the tree blowing for a minute. But real motion - if it's caught - might record for 10 - 20 seconds. If real lucky it will record 30 seconds of a moving object and then nothing will trigger again - even loading a car on a trailer!Batteries don't last even when trees aren't blowing. I purchased solar panel chargers, as well for power reliance.I have called Ring multiple times but it appears it's just a bad product because it never gets better. The support team tries but it becomes hours of wasted time.Resetting cameras is extremely painful as a button on camera has to be pushed. (Some cameras must be opened to push button) Climbing up and down ladders to push those reset buttons when be it's 100+ degrees is a terrible experience. Outdoors you can NOT see any light flashing to pair in many of the models. This model has a flashing light 'globe' on the bottom but the door with this one doesn't hinge tightly onto the camera base to close it!  It doesn't stay closed until you mess with it and then don't breathe hoping it will stay.Often the camera has to be taken down to reset in trying to make it work. The first thing Ring support wants to do is run a WiFi test - which 'hello' - I've done multiple times, I've reset the modem, router and camera. Then they say 'reset the camera' - which by be the time I call I've done at least 5 times as well.The ability to connect to WiFi is poor. Other brands in the same location connect and stay connected. They respond to motion. The Ring cameras don't trigger when someone walks to the car in full vision of the camera, gets in the car and drives off. View 1: car in driveway 2: next view car 'poofs' into disappearance! No motion of anything in between. I took the camera down and waived a towel in front of it and it never triggered to start recording video.I started out with a single battery. It didn't last so I bought another battery. Still the camera - connected to a solar panel - didn't last past 5 pm. Could not do 'live views' with constant low battery notice. I had turned off the spotlight feature but it made no difference. Why buy a spotlight camera if the spotlight feature had to constantly be turned off in hopes the camera might work and the batteries might last past dusk?The voice communication is horrible. No one can understand or even know you are trying to talk to them. If they respond in anyway, you can't understand what they say.Signal reported by camera in app is ~36 or occasionally up to 50 but that's rare. I've got a whole house mesh wireless system that I bought thinking my Netgear Nighthawk wasn't maintaining a strong enough signal even with the powerful booster extender and good signal at the camera locations. I ran all the cameras on a different channel than other IoT devices.I have a large investment that is not working and does nothing to provide security. I've been trying to work with Ring for 5 years giving them every chance, buying the newer cameras, resetting and resetting cameras.I also added fiber to improve the network. Nothing has worked to make the Ring cameras perform as promised.I have purchased several models of cameras. The first stickups were more reliable but 720 just doesn't cut it.  Sadly, I could never recommend Ring with the experience, expense of cameras, invested time and additional equipment expenses I have had.I could have and should have hired a good security company to install a camera system that worked for much less at this point.

33,AJS the OneNinerFive,Battery powered versus wired camera.,"  So I'm comparing this battery powered model to our wired model we also have installed. There are definitely trade offs you have to make if you go with the battery model over the wired model. The biggest difference is the night vision video quality. The battery model does not support true infrared assisted night vision, obviously since this would deplete the battery in only a few days. Also the motion detection system is not as sophisticated. On my wired model, I can set specific zones where I want alerts if motion is detected, or vice versa. For example, I do not want my flags on the front porch setting off our camera, so I can customize the motion settings to ignore the areas with the flags. The battery powered model simply has a range/sensitivity slider that determines it's range. On the plus side the battery in the battery powered model lasts almost a solid two weeks before it needs recharged. Also the easy of installation is nice. All in all if you have a way to install the wired camera, go that route as you will be happier with the camera features and video quality.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2019"

Was because I thought it would save on my electric bill, because I wouldn't have to leave my porch lights on allnight. And it does do a decent job and is atleast some protection.I was very frustrated, that it did not mention a Ring Protection Plan was REQUIRED! Without it the device(s) are useless. The info on the page made it seem like a plan was optional and not needed for operation. And twice now, a delivery person has dropped off a package at my door and the device did not catch them! Although, to be fair, it did catch the back of one of the delivery persons'.If you live on a busy street do not buy this! It will go off continuously! And no amount of motion sensor tuning will fix it. I mute the notifications (it still records events).The neighborhood feature is nice, but if you live in a major city. I suggest narrowing down this feature to within a few blocks of your home. I live in Baltimore. 5 miles had this thing giving me updates from across the harbor!Picture quality is also good day and night. But I tried to zoom in on a vehicle's tag during daytime, 10ft from my door and couldn't read it.I'm waiting to see if the talk option works. Delivery people move to fast for me to try it out. If it doesn't I am returning it.***UPDATE***After working with Alexis (CS). I am happy to say my spotlight cam is working a whole lot better! I still get a lot of motion alerts, but the false events have decreased greatly.  And my battery life has improved. It use to only last a week. A week has passed and I still have half the battery remaining!****UPDATE****After working very well for two days. My spotlight camera has been working like it did when I first bought it. The vast majority of motion events are false. There's no one walking past or any cars driving past the camera, but it still goes off. Even with the motion zones turned off. The camera is still giving me false motion events. I was thinking of getting a ring doorbell, but they have motion sensors in them to (all of them). And that will be right on the street as well.

35,Chris and Sarah,"and over all I'm happy. Camera/""live view"" started working better about a day ...","  Bought this for the front door, with the solar panel, which keeps the single battery at 100% full time.  System works fairly well, and over all I'm happy. Camera/""live view"" started working better about a day after I set it up, most likely due to firmware updates being applied. I had to fiddle a bit with motion sensitivity, but it's very useful to review comings and goings. The speaker isn't great, but it is handy in a pinch if you need to communicate with a delivery person or something. I'm considering a few AC-wired floodlight cams for the periphery. The hardwired are better as they record continuously, vs the battery powered which only start recording on motion. Didn't realize that when I bought it, but I don't have existing power to that location so no problem. It would be nice if Ring was doing more with PoE, as I imagine a few of these devices running on your WiFi will likely impact other device's connectivity.  When I get around to it I will create a separate WiFi network just for the cam(s). Ring is currently sending all data unencrypted, which is unfortunate if you don't trust your ISP or other middlemen.

36,God first always!!,UPDATED Review - total waste of time and money,"  Update - I updated my review from four to one stars.  Here's the reason why.  I have a RING Stickup and a RING Spotlight covering our pool and backyard.  Both are battery powered with attached solar units.  I've had some issue with the company that chemically treats our yard for weeds etc.  I knew they were coming a few days ago, so when I got home I pulled up the videos from our backyard (the aforementioned cameras).  One recorded him coming into the backyard but not leaving.  The other didn't record him or alert that someone had entered a motion zone (it was obvious from the one camera that he had in fact entered motion zones for both cameras).  I called RING Tech support and spoke with Mel.  Pleasant enough guy but not helpful. We started with the discovery my recorded length was 20sec when it should have been 30 which is the default.  I asked where I could change that and he gave me instructions, but the options he quoted were not available on any of my cameras.  He told me to delete the app and reinstall.  I did but still no joy.  He then said he could change it from their end.  Then we discussed zone settings and he said my RING Stickup camera had five zones with one turned off.  None of my cameras have five zones, they all have three.  I asked him for clarification and he repeated ""from my end, I see five zones on the stick up camera and one is turned off).  Now, how does he see five zones and I see three?  We then tried to trouble shoot why the cameras were detecting motion but not recording.  NO CLUE, said he would have to escalate the problem (means throw in the white towel) but said he would send me an email outlining our discussion and assuring me he would continue to trouble shoot.  Got the email - basically said I should consider two step authentication (which I already had set up).  Replied that I was not satisfied and the one time I really needed the RING to work, it didn't.  He did reply and restated he was going to continue troubleshooting the issue.  Long story short - three of my battery RING cameras have proven unreliable.  The only one that seems to work worth a darn is the wired RING door bell.  Total waste of money.Purchased this along with a solar panel for our backyard.  A couple of positives are it is small and the install was easy.  Now the negatives in my opinion; the speaker is so small that it's impossible to use it to speak to anyone.  You can hear but it's squeaky.  I have two wifi extenders in our home in addition to our router and it's still hit or miss with how long it takes to connect when I get an alert.  It does offer peace of mind, but looking back I think there are a number of other products available that were cheaper and may perform better.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2020"
37,User Product Review,Poor night vision with Spotlight Cam Battery in comparison with other Ring cams,"  UPDATE: I got contacted by Ring Customer Service and O was offered to exchange the Spotlight Battery Cam to Spotlight Wired one. Couldn't be happier with the exchange, wired works good. See below why night vision on Wired/Mount/Spotlight is better than on battery variant. And special thanks to Ring Support (to Jess, in particular), didn't expect that level of support!The quality of the night vision in my Spotlight Cam Battery is unacceptable. I have two cameras installed in the same spot - Spotlight Cam Battery and Ring Stick Up Cam Battery (later I tried the Spotlight Mount as well). The Stick Up camera (and Mount) shows bright b/w picture at night, while Spotlight Cam Battery shows very dim picture, like the IR lights are not even functioning for it (I can see red dots on its face, though).And yes, I tried to wipe the lens, I tried to reset the cam and to re-pair - no dice. HDR on / off doesn’t seem to make any difference either. There is no Color Night Vision option for the Spotlight Cam Battery (but it exists for the Mount variant, assuming it also exists for the Wired).On the attached pic you can see the screenshots of the Spotlight Battery (top) and Stick Up Battery (bottom). The difference is HUGE. Both of the cameras are installed at the same spot with the same light conditions. Both cameras are BATTERY powered, see my first post. Moreover, the Spotlight Cam Battery had 100% charge with the charger connected to it.UPD: Look at the pics, they show the difference in infrared light for Battery and Wired/Mount/Spotlight versions. The Battery variant has infrared lights on SIDES of the camera, while the rest of the family has them in FRONT. I believe this is the reason why the night vision is so poor for the battery version.I'd love to put 5 stars to Ring's Customer Service, but unfortunately this particular product has some design flaws and I can't give 5 stars to the PRODUCT. I am a huge Ring fan, I have multiple Ring product and I am mostly happy with all of them, well, other than the Spotlight Cam Battery thing.

38,Blanca,Disappointed,"  I love the doorbell but this camera is awkward. If you want it to not stand out so much then good luck. When it detects anything the ""frosted area"" shows red lights ( however dim ). I personally don't like that. It's also a bit bulky.Main my concern is that depending on the model the app software differs. The “battery” charged models lack the advanced motion detection setting where you can create “zones” otherwise you are defaulted to a default “fan shaped” area that you can decrease or increase in size. Why aren’t they all equipped with “advanced self create zones”? Same software right? This was the nine put off.Been sticking with Nest Cams. The app is intuitive and I can turn off any lights that show it is recording or what not.Of course you can't turn off the infa-red lights on any camera but if it could it'd be better. I don’t get compensated by Nest this is an honest customers opinion and just that , my opinion and experience. Oh and yes every camera lets you create “motion. zones”, up to 5 per device I believe.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2019"
39,M,Don’t waste your money or time with Ring,"  Ring seems to have the right idea however, this item is produced in order to be outside. The connection is the worst. You basically have to have your modem next to the ring items in order to work. I was dumb enough to purchase the doorbell, the alarm system and then this worthless item. I had to constantly call to get it fixed and they had to send me several replacements for the alarm and for this thing. They don’t work unless the modem is  next to the items. It happens to be that my modem is inside my house and you can’t have barriers interrupting the signal. Example doors with wood and metal. Go figure. Couldn’t they invent something that works with what doors are made out of. The WiFi connection is the worst. Constantly loosing signal. Ring is not worth it. I suggest you spend your money with alarm companies that work or have the modem right next to your ring items outside in order for them to work. They won’t work if your modem is inside your house and these items are outside. Good luck",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2019"
40,Thomas,Peace of mind? achieved,"  Overall this is a solid peace of security equipment that delivers piece of mind the moment when it’s activated. Solidly built and less of the energy hog i thought it would be. Besides, yelling at your significant others/kids when you get a notification is a lot of fun!I read the reviews prior to purchasing. Amazon could tell you that this sat in my cart for a couple of months as I wrestled with what cam to purchase. I was pleasantly surprised that all of my reservations became yarns spun by other security cam co’s.Battery life: ridiculously solid. I see tons of reviews that say get an extra battery or solar panel. I won’t be needing that. I don’t use the lights which may be why, but it’s at 60% after a month and a half of use (my ring goes off about 10-15 times per day). I’ve yet to charge it.Privacy: zones is a lifesaver as i have hanging plants in its view. It was picking up hummingbirds (didn’t know i had them!) so i adjusted the zone and ancillary alerts went poof. I still have it’s sensitivity set to high, but also only set to recognize people.Security: there were some recent break-ins in the neighborhood which was the impetus to purchase. A burglar went into our garage and poked around and while they are at large currently, they saw the cam and ran. We were able to easily give the video to the police. This thing delivers blockbuster quality in light and dark conditions, so we could easily see the culprit. They took nothing, but we took their image. Who’s laughing now? Me, as I watch the video over and over and bust a gut when they scram. Maybe look for the camera upfront (as it was RIGHT THERE!)What’s great: it’s portable! I could simply move this to a better location. Being a security freak, I will just buy a second.If I had to think of a downside, i’d be hard pressed to find one. It’s solid. You get alerts whenever there is action, and if I wanted to, I could be the eye in sky/big brother/intangible hand watching over my domain. For me the price matches the peace of mind I’ve gained as a return. Word.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2020"
41,D. Sindell,Wanted to rate it 5 stars but couldn't.,"  I ordered two Spotlight Cam Battery units during the two days of Prime Day.  For the few minutes that I had them running, they worked as advertised but then came the problems.  The first camera's mount was defective and the camera itself took on condensation after a much-needed rain.  I called Ring and they replaced the mount and added 2 batteries to compensate me for my trouble.  Ring also replaced the camera, which I haven't received yet.  The second cam started changing to night vision during the day after I added it to my Ring app. Ring's customer service took me through a few steps before they determined that it needed to be replaced.  This time I contacted Amazon for the replacement, unfortunately, Amazon cannot get another camera to my home until August 13th.  Oh, I must mention that the mount on the second cam had the same problem as the first cam.  Fortunately, Ring sent me 2 mounts.  Ring's customer service has been nothing but exemplary throughout this annoying situation.  I do not doubt that I will be satisfied with the cameras once I get them installed and perhaps I can give a 5-star rating at that time.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2019"
42,bluesy,"Doesn't connect to the app very well, less than ideal customer service",  It doesn't connect to my phone very well and sometimes takes minutes to finally load the video feed. It also doesn't connect when my wife and I are on either of our work WiFis... this makes no sense since Nest cameras connected just fine. I tried to work out the issue with a rep at Ring and after what seemed like a hundred emails back and forth they finally agreed to exchange it with another to see if its the hardware. They required I put a hold on my credit card to ensure I send back the old camera (which isn't a big deal but made me feel like they were pre-accusing me of stealing it and I have never had this happen with more expensive products) but then they sent me the wrong color! After I told them I got the wrong color they asked for the serial # of my current camera to prove it was the white one since their records said differently. Overall they really didn't make me feel like a valued customer at all and it makes me think twice about ever buying a Ring product again.Even though Amazon bought Ring they clearly haven't integrated their customer service...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2018"
43,Art17,"Works pretty good most of the time, kinda.","  1. Amazon initially shipped me a preopened unit. They rectified the situation but still, I want it right the first time.2. A. Camera works fairly well, I have it pointed towards a parking pad on an alley way in an urban area. Motion detector activates with almost everything traveling down the alleyway HOWEVER, when the motion detector activates, it takes a moment for the camera to turn on and another moment for the aperture of the camera to adjust so initial video is often very bright before adjusting to something actually visible. This all takes several seconds so anything fast moving is quickly out of frame.2. B. The camera has good quality in daylight but the nigh-vision mode with the spotlight deactivated only allows faces to be recognizable within less than 10 ft. If this is mounted on a home, 10 ft means the subject needs to be almost underneath the camera with night-vision mode. Further than that and they look like something from a horror movie.2. C. Both the camera and motion detector can be obscured by fog. System was working great and triggering with every small thing in the yard but first big fog of late summer/early fall, my car was broken into and motion camera failed to catch most of the activity, what was caught was too blurry due to moisture on the lens.2. D. Battery does not last very long if camera is being triggered often.  Amazon says they'll last up to 6 months but mine lasted maybe 2 months with I'd say 10+ triggers per day.2. E. Camera is $200 but this only allows live view, live interaction, live etc. If you want it to RECORD which I feel is the main purpose of security cameras then it's an additional $30-$100/year depending on the number of cameras on top of the $200/camera you're already spending.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2018"
44,Art17,Very nice product with some minor glitches,"  Overall, the Ring Camera works quite well. Its relatively simple to install and the camera works well. Here are my pros and cons:Pro:The camera works well (my guess the range is about 120 degrees.  The picture is sharp and the color is accurate. My iPhone picks up the camera well. The motion detection works well and there is a relatively small light that will come on if the camera detects movement at night. I mounted the camera on my garage which is about 25 feet from my house. (didn't work; see Con's).  I also bought the solar power device and it has recharged the battery to 100% each day (even a day with heavy clouds and rain).  Ring has a 24 hour tech support group and I found the staff to be pleasant and helpful. Ring's software is easy to follow and there is a help feature which is useful.Much like the Ring doorbell, the camera enables the user to listen and speak to anyone that is near the camera.Con'sRing suggests that buyers move the camera to different spots to determine if it is working well.  I received a good picture and the sound features worked well. However, I wasn't aware that should read the ""signal strength"" reading which is in the ""Device Health"" function for my camera. Signal strength must have a reading of 45 or lower.  My signal strength was 65 and the picture was slow and distorted from time to time.  I corrected the problem by putting an old range extender that I had in the garage and the signal strength quickly dropped to 39 (the lower the better).  The signal distortion vanished.. Ring offers a device to extend the wifi signal but the camera responds well to wifi extenders.The software settings are intended to allow the owner to stop motion detection. Unfortunately, the motion detection operates despite the software  and sends videos to my iPhone all the time. Also, I linked my Ring to my Amazon Echo and it reports motion detection aloud whenever the camera detects motion. Its easy to delete the unwanted videos but annoying to have to do so.  Also, it took about 5 calls to Ring to find out that the some of technicians know that this occurs while others don't know that. When you call Ring, the technicians can join the user to see what is going on in the camera software.  That is helpful but technicians see a different time period for stopping motion detection than the time period that the user has up on he/she's device. They know about this glitch but don't know how to fix it.The motion detector will can pick up bugs (like a moth or spider) if it is on the camera or flying by.  It will also report motion detection if there is a hard rain (and maybe, snow).The camera has a space for two batteries, but Ring only provides one. You can purchase a battery, I bought two since I have another Ring Camera on the way from Amazon. One of the technicians sent me a second battery because we were on the phone for a long time.  After an email about delivery acknowledgement six days ago, I am stilling waiting for the battery, but ""one-offs"" as the Ring staff call it, take 7-10 days for delivery.  I was told that direct purchases from Ring take 3-5 days for delivery.  Buying Ring batteries  from Amazon (which owns Ring) takes 2-3 days.If you purchase the Ring ""Plus"" warranty, you get an array of benefits.  One of the benefits is an extend warranty for the product as long as the warranty was purchased within the 30 day purchase date.  The Ring website says extended warranty continues as long as the Plus warranty exists. However, the website does not describe the elements of the product warranty.Ring offers a 10% discount on purchases if you own the Plus warranty.  Unfortunately, I was told by Ring that  the discount does not apply to purchases at Amazon; only purchases from Ring. This seems odd to me since Amazon owns Ring.Last thought, The cover on the Camera (which is on the bottom of the camera) doesn't appear to be water-resistant. Also, there are small holes that were used to screw the solar panel connection to the camera.  While solar panel no longer has plastic clamp that was previously provided, the holes for the screws are still there. There is a plastic slide that covers the holes but the slide is below the hole.  I think that water is likely to get in and I bought a cover from another company to remedy the cover and the hole problem.On balance, I like the product and believe that strengths of this product exceed the small glitches that I described. I have another camera on the way for use in the front of my house.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2019"
45,MustangMan,Disappointing motion detection,"  I had Doorbell Pro and Floodlight Wired Pro installed around my house and I was really impressed with their video quality and 3D motion detection.  However, Spotlight Cam is such a big disappointment.  A large part of values from Ring products are based on motion detection since it only records when triggered by a motion.  Spotlight Cam's motion detection only occasionally captures motions right in front of the camera.  I have tried everything including adjusting the view angle of the camera, resetting to factory, changing motion sensitivity to maximum, turning on/off advanced motion detection, frequency of motion detection but none of them worked.  You couldn't even trigger by waving your hands right in front of the motion sensor.  Note I am not even complaining about false alerts which are common issues from motion sensors.  The PIR on Spotlight Cam can't even detect real motion.The other issue that I ran into with the product is the false ""battery door not closed"" warning.  This seems a common issue with Spotlight Cam after I did some research on the Internet.  It is annoying but I can live with it.To the bright side, the solar panel that I bought with the camera works great.Overall, I am very disappointed with this product.  I would give 5 stars to the Pro series but this product is seriously a one star product.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2021"
46,Poppadoo,Don't waste your money.,"  First off, I'm a ring fanboi. Between my home and business I have 2 alarms, and 20 cameras. These 4 would have been 24. I love their products and recommend them to everyone. I had arlo cameras before and they are trash. I would not recommend them to anyone, until using ring battery cameras.These things are trash. I purchased 4 of them and 4 solar panels. To begin with, I believe they use different software than the wired spotlight cam, I may be wrong, its been a while since I set up my wired spotlight cams. The software seems to be tailored to the battery cams so it shorts you on every feature. Even at maximum settings, it's not as good as the wired cam.Both of the cams i installed, I put up with the solar panels. The first one was up for about a month and started showing low batteries. I dragged out the ladder climbed up and it was still plugged in, but not acknowledging that the solar panel was there. I unplugged it, plugged it back in, and then it began working again.While I had the ladder out, I installed the other camera and solar panel. Within 2 weeks, battery was low. Again I dragged out the ladder climbed up and unplugged it and plugged it back in. Luckily the first cam that I installed was still using the solar. 2 weeks later, oh look the batteries are low. Then a few days later the other one reported the same thing.In my opinion these are trash, about the same quality as arlo cams, but these are much more expensive.  If you absolutely have to use battery cams, Arlo may be the better bet as the total cost of ownership is lower.

47,Larry,"Decent but not great ""Lowering the Stars""","  This specific camera is ok, but not the best. The battery life is rather short due to the sensitivity of the motion detection.

48,TMH,Solar Charger Doesn't Work!,"  This camera would be great if it worked.  A few months ago I added a solar panel, and viola, I had 100% battery.  A week or so ago, it stopped charging, with no notifications until I noticed the battery was at 9% (I actually have two batteries, the other was at 30%).  The app shows ""established"" for the camera's connection to the solar panel.If I were the only one having this issue, I'd certainly contact support.  But if you go to community.ring.com and do a search on this issue, there are hundreds of people who are having the same issue, many of them recently.  Ring does the usual tech support, with the goal of making the person go away, not fixing their problem.  They've replaced panels, batteries, cameras, and people have the same issue.  They've suggested factory-resetting the camera, making you go through the process of adding it to your account again, and people have the same issue.I'm not going to waste my time talking to support when these ideas clearly don't work.  I'd suggest you don't buy this product unless you are absolutely OK taking the battery out of the camera and recharging it once a week or so (or they get this problem fixed).If this were a small start-up, I could give them a little leeway, and I have no doubt the communication would be light-years better.  But this is Amazon, one of the largest companies in the world.  They have the resources and choose not to deploy them.When it works, the Ring system is pretty good.  But it's a security system.  Failure like this is unacceptable!  What if a camera goes dead, and someone breaks into your home?  What if you're up on a ladder replacing a battery that's not being charged, and you fall?This issue actually increases the risk to Ring users over when it worked.Get your act together Amazon!",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2020"
49,D. Behrman,Good Battery Camera,"  Camera works great as advertised.  No issues.  But please note:  This is the Battery powered version of this camera setup and works as all battery powered cameras work, which is to say it starts recording when it senses motion and stops after a predetermined (programmable) time.  Of course there is a lag between all this starting and stopping so you will always miss the first couple of seconds of motion being recorded as the camera has to power on.  Which for the most part is not an issue, but if people quickly walk in and out of the recording area you may only get the back of their head as they are walking away.  If you mount this at your front door you will notice this a lot for Amazon or UPS deliveries as those delivery personal are very quick to drop off your package.  A lot of people complain about this, but this is really just the nature of a battery operated system.  While the Battery powered systems have their place, I would advise to only get one if you are mounting it in an area that has no nearby AC power.  Maybe a shed out back or something like that.  In order to always capture all motion, including the very quick in and out of a delivery person you need to have an AC powered Camera.  The big difference being the AC powered systems are continuously on and recoding everything, then when they detect motion they back up a few seconds before that motion was detected and save that whole scene.  So on the AC powered systems you will actually see the delivery person walking into your detection zone—nothing is missed.  Obviously the Battery powered systems can’t do this “continuous-record"" feature as that would run the battery down in less than a day, so they have to run in an on-off mode.  Again I have two of these battery powered systems and for the right application they work fine as advertised, but just understand exactly what you are ordering and how it works.  My advice:  If you plan to mount anywhere near AC power, then get the hard wired version and take your time to tie it into you electrical system.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2022"

I tried moving my Ring Chime Pro around the house so it is closer to the cam but it didn't help with the Wifi, it is still weak making my video play back choppy at times.  The spotlight is not as bright as I hoped.  I believe Ring used to make this a 700 lumen when it first came out, now it is just 300 lumen.  There is no security screw to lock the battery compartment, making it possible for people to steal the battery since my placement is just 7' high.  The good thing is it can hold 2 batteries vs 1 on the Stick Up and the siren is a little louder (could use 20 more decibel louder).  I mean if you are going to set off the siren, might as well make it loud to really scare off intruders.  This camera does have the enhanced motion detection just like the Stick Up Cam where you can drag the dots on the screen to cover where you want motion notification.  I cannot make the stand so it is facing up the sky cause I wanted to place it on top of my 8' fence, but that is not possible.  I only bought is because it was on sale for $159.00.** Update - after having a chance to use it some more, the video is not as good as the Stick Up cam (grainy and harder to make out the person face) and there is ghosting on a person movement.  Turning on/off HDR didn't make any difference. There is about a 2 seconds delay in video for it to show up on my phone (the feed is delay on my phone).  Video playback skips and freeze (could be my wifi).  Motion detection will not pick up my movement when I'm on top of the motion zone.  I need to be at least 15ft from the camera.

53,Michael,Camera is ok but you need to check your extended warranty coverage.,"  This new camera is okay.  The setup wasn't too bad. You just need to make sure you have everything checked before screwing it all down.The reason why I'm giving this one star is because of the warranty.  If you are paying for yearly coverage (the plus plan) you will need to make sure that there are no gaps in your subscription.  This means that if you bought more Ring products from Costco which before had bonus yearly subscription you can't activate it.  If you do that constitutes a cancellation of their service which in turn negates the warranty on all of the Ring products you bought prior.  I just found this out today and even though I had inquired about it back when I had my trial subscription activated and was told that it would not affect my extended warranty but since I didn't get that in writing all the products that were out of standard warranty period when the trial subscription began are no longer covered.  So only new products purchased when the paid subscription starts are under extended warranty.  Thus most of my Ring products (almost $2K worth) are no longer under extended warranty.I'm contemplating cancelling my current subscription with them out of principle. Yes, the subscription service is pretty good given what is included but I felt I've been lied to and cheated.  Again, if you are under the impression that your Ring products are under their extended warranty you better make sure and check.

59,J. Hancock,Rather disappointed with the battery version,"  I've been generally happy with the wired version of this camera, so I decided to get the battery powered version for a location where running power isn't possible. Unfortunately this version is much worse!The video quality is subpar for a camera of this price. I use a couple Eufy cameras around my property and the video quality is significantly better on those, and they're battery powered too!The app sucks! There's roughly a 60% chance of the video actually showing up, or the live feed appearing in a reasonable time. And this is on a brand new phone. It's even worse on my wife's slightly older phone. The wired version actually seems to work better in this regard.The night vision is subpar. It's good for maybe about 15 feet away from the camera. Again, the Eufy cameras have much better IR night vision.The motion detection is also worse on this version compared to the wired version. The camera is unable to detect motion in roughly the top quarter of the image. It won't let you select that region for detection. I have to get rather close to the camera before motion is detected.Motion detection for the floodlight is also pretty weak. It doesn't detect me from about 20 feet away, right in line with the camera. The wired version doesn't have this problem either!The floodlight isn't as bright as the wired version.On the plus side, the battery life is really good. You can put 2 batteries in the camera which is a great feature, and after about 70 days they're at about 40%. Although to be fair, one of my Eufys has been going for 115 days and it's at 50%, and that's with fairly non conservative detection and recording settings.In conclusion, I definitely wouldn't buy the battery version again. Maybe the wired version, but the video handling of the app would hold me back a little bit. Most likely I will be replacing this camera with a Eufy, unfortunately.If you're already stuck in the Ring ecosystem, save yourself some disappointment and frustration and get the wired version of this camera.

60,Just4sc,"BUYER BEWARE, USELESS in WINTER / COLD Climates","  I contacted customer service today about and issue with the batteries being 100% dead.  I have had my two stick up cameras with solar panels attached all year without a single hiccup. Suddenly my batteries drained and died daily now.  No setting changes on my end. The rep indicated their batteries don't work well below freezing  ( it has not been below freezing but one day).  My question is why does Ring not stand behind their products, this renders my cameras useless during all of winter here in Virginia (east side not mountain side so mild winter).  I asked why this information is not provided up front anywhere to customers, had I known this I would have made a different decision on what products I went with (AKA not ring).  These are OUTDOOR cameras, they should be made for all the elements, or else DISCLOSE this !!

61,Paul,U want  a ring cam wait until continuous record opt w/cloud or buy a different one with better tech,"  I was impressed how simple some aspects of the Ring Cameras ( both outdoor battery, outdoor wired, & indoor stick ( I don’t remember the name)cameras The install was simple. 1 of my outdoor cameras (battery w/accessory plug so no recharging necessary) was no longer able to be viewed. I went to the camera and changed out the batteries but no help. I tried the reset button which no longer reset anything. It did not make a change and would not go into setup mode. I HAD TO REPLACE THAT CAMERA). Now I think about 2-3 years of the door bell. Wider doorbell component. The battery from one week to the next went from a charge every 2-3 weeks (my previous door bell wires when attached just caused my old doorbell to ring once and then the transformer would hum and not charge. NOW IN 3 days with every setting set to the minimum and we don’t get many people stopping by IT GOES DEAD. FROM 100% IN THE AFTERNOON TO 87% BY THAT NIGHT AND 3rd MORNING AFTER AT 42%. SO BY END OF DAY OR TOMORROW MORNING IT WILL REQUIRE CHARGING.Now recording, my wi-fi has great speed. The recording usually happens after the occurrence occurred by a few seconds. You don’t necessarily get everything and cannot record for any length of manual time.I now purchased a wireless network requires power and cloud records. I get 24 hours you can purchase more time.

62,Douglas M.

I replaced one of these and it still has same issue.  Fails to connect with Live View. the doorbell3 fails Live view almost always. and does it repeatedly.The Outdoor stickup cams and indoor stickup cams work fantastic.  flawlessly.  even in the same spot as the failing doorbell3.I have 4 outdoor stickup cams and they all work well.  the doorbell3 works good for motion but terrible for Live View. connects about 20% of the time and fails over 80% of the time or more.as a result of the distance I am trying to use the light at the light does little. im sure if used for 10 to 20 feet it would be fine.Live View fails to connect too often.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2021"
63,Bad Wolf 209,Prefer the Nest Outdoor Cam,"  Edit: camera stopped picking up any motion today so it’s not recording anything. Only live view works. We’ve had it less than a week.I've had the Nest Cam Outdoor for a few years now. Its a great camera but the need to plug into a power supply isn't feasible so I settled for having it set up indoor facing out a window. The downside is night vision must be turned off as the window reflects like a mirror with the night vision light or inside lights turned on. It was also unsightly propped up on the window ledge with the cord hanging down. Decided to try this Ring camera. For us, the only upside is its battery operated so it can be mounted anywhere. Given the investment, if we were to start all over, we'd look into for the Arlo system.Here's our two deal breakers:1. Motion Zones customization with the Ring is very limited. You can select three zones that fan out almost 180 degrees and set how far they fan out. This likely works fine if you have a traditional front or backyard. We are in a busy area and  our houses are very close to the street so the zone is picking up every single person and car that goes by.  The result is a ridiculous amount of useless notifications. With the Nest, you can draw multiple zones to pinpoint an exact area you want to receive notifications.2. The Ring only provides clips vs a continuous feed history. In theory, this should be sufficient but I've found Ring Event History clips aren't recording the entire event. Example: the mailman came through our gate and into our patio to leave a package but the Ring only recorded him after he was back outside of the gate and walking away. It missed him opening the gate, walking into the patio, dropping off the package, walking back to the gate and exiting. If this would have been someone stealing the package the footage would have been useless. This has never happened with Next but if it did, you could scroll through continuous footage for several days or longer (depending on your plan). Since both cameras also see all the way to our neighbors house across the street, the continuous Nest history footage allows you to go back and see everything...not just what's in your notification zone. If a car gets broken into on the street, we can go back and see it. Something happens at our neighbors house, we can go back and see it. A suspicious person is casing the neighborhood but didn't come onto our property, we can go back and see it.A few pros:1. Motion activated spotlight is a useful feature.2. User activated alarm.3. Easy set up with a decent app.We will keep the camera but will still use the Nest camera in the window when on vacation.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2019"
64,PFCAnde,Failure. Utter Failure,"  We've had the device just under 2 years. It has never been exposed to harsh conditions. It worked fine for the first year.Pros - Its a deterrent.Cons- Video quality is okay at best.-The sensor is unbelievably spotty. It will catch a vehicle coming up to our driveway, fail to record the person getting out and performing an action, then will start recording when they are about to close the car door and leave. Not exactly helpful when you're trying to catch a PERSON trespassing.-The solar panel has to collect sunlight EVERY day for the device to keep a battery charge. Don't expect it to work for 8 hours after an overcast or rainy day.-Anytime there is a device update, expect it to (1) kick off any additional users from your device account permanently (2) Disconnect the wifi and render the camera useless until you spend FOUR HOURS on the phone with Ring tech support to determine that their camera is well-marketed garbage with cruddy firmware.Overall not recommended.

66,Steven Sun,Good camera with some issues,"  I really have enjoyed having this Ring Spotlight Camera. It was easy to set up and it has given me peace of mind when it comes to who might be coming to my door when I am not home or even when I am home. The quality of the image is pretty decent too. I have been able to see the image well & the video are usually pretty clear.My main issue is how long the batteries last. I usually only get 4-6 days on one battery before I have to charge it. Luckily, I bought a second battery so I get roughly 2 weeks on the battery. The other issue is no matter what, it is going to pick up cars driving past, or light shifts etc. It's a little hard to go throughout the day and get the constant alerts when it's just a car driving past. Even with changing the sensitivity, it either picks up a car or it doesn't register someone walking up to the house until they're walking away.All in all, I recommend it but I wish that there was a happy medium with the sensitivity on the camera.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2018"
67,sparky,Stops working after a few months! Known Issue! DO NOT BUY,"  I had my camera working perfectly for 18 months. I even bought an extra battery for it to be able to cycle through chargings without it being down. One day it completely died so I went to the backyard to remove it and swap out the batteries. After adding two fully charged batteries the camera lit up red on the inside light and wouldn't recognize the charged batteries. I tried swapping them, resetting the device, charging batteries again, and nothing. When I contacted Ring they asked me to do the exact same thing I did to no avail. The rep told me that at 18 months my camera was now out of warranty and I would need to purchase a new one. They offered a discount on a new one.As with many things that go wrong I began to search online to see if others experienced the same thing and to my surprise several message boards on the Ring forum, Reddit, Nextdoor app, etc... had people describing the same issue! This is a known issue and one that Ring does not provide a valid fix or replacement for. At this point, it may become a class action issue with so many affected. I am very disappointed because I do like the product when it works but spending $200 on cameras that break a few months in is not something I can afford.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2020"
68,Jessica James,It works,"  UPDATE: Big problem with battery draining too fast. It came with only one battery and it only lasted after full charged battery for 4 days that’s it. You can’t even go on vacation with that, so I ordered 2nd battery now it will last 8 days with double battery. But it said lasts 6 months, it’s not true.It does what it says, only thing is wrong with the design is, you can not secure the battery cover, anyone can come and push the button to release the battery cover and remove it, then it becomes useless.However, if they made a hole that you can put a screw, then it would be better.So, I am wrapping it with strong packaging tape. I would suggest you do the same because it would be very difficult to remove it, by then you captured everything.It’s clear picture and very sensitive  motion detector if you want to can change how sensitive you would like.It takes getting use to it, but once you had it set up and play with it for a while (it’s fun by the way) it’s a must to have these days, this one has a siren! Very loud only way you can activate the sound is by pushing the alarm/siren button by hand on your device iPhone or iPad etc…Update 2:  To extend the battery life I turn off the lights, first of all you don’t need it during the day it’s  daylightAlso, during the evening it has a night vision. It saved soooo much battery now 1 battery will last 2-3  weeks It’s amazing also my second battery arrived, now I don’t have to worry at least 6 weeks, it’s not bad.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2022"
69,guy c,Updated review below- Works great except for continued error message,"  UPDATE-  returned the original unit for a replacement- it was faulty and I think it might have been a returned unit that they originally sent me- I say this as it was in an market box- it did have compartments like it was made for it, but my replacement unit had full graphics box and a box cover (see below). The new unit works like a charm- have had it up and running with two batteries for about 6 weeks and looks like it will be another couple weeks before I need to recharge.  Also the long delay went away with new unit - it is literally a second or two before we get our notice of movement.  The one issue we do have with this unit is that it does not work in cold weather- zero or below…. Living in NH this is an issue most nights in January and February and sometimes during the days. When it warms up it starts working again on its own but during these cold months it does not work frequently.  Wish this had been disclosed up front.  But when it works it works great and is highly customizable and I like that. So changed review from 3 stars to 4…..  ORIGINAL REVIEW-Like that it is small and wireless.  We will see how long the battery last- varying results in other reviews. Love the clear picture, it is amazing. Seems to be a slight delay in reporting movement to my iPhone- maybe 5 - 10 second delay, thought it would be instant. The big disappointment is this error message I keep getting saying battery door is not shut and unit will not work right until it is fixed.  Went onto ring and looked up the issue - this apparently is a BIG issue that ring has not been able to fix.  The string of complaints about this has had 11,900 views which means that many people have searched this issue with them. WOW!  They posted a fix but of course it does not work and every single comment speaks to that.  Yes I tried it and it did not work for me either. So disappointed- it appears while some units do not have this error message, most do…. Going to keep it for a couple weeks and see how it does but probably will return it for a replacement.

71,Makai,Impressive motion detection and hassle free,"  This little piece of technology is just what I was looking for.  I wanted something that would make it impossible to be surprised with a knock at the door.  I live in a street level apartment in a pretty active area.  The camera is mounted about 7 feet about the sidewalk (more on that in a minute).  I reduced the motion detection range to 50% of full size since I'm more interested in who is walking towards my apartment than anything else.  This camera identifies EVERY person that walks along the sidewalk (about 12 feet from where it's mounted).  It also detects the cars that drive down the street.  For my purpose, this level of awareness is extremely reassuring.A note on installation: You may be tempted to find a solution to mount this camera without having to drill into your exterior walls.  Resist the urge!  I tried several different methods, none of which worked.  The weight is distributed in a way that requires a stronger opposing force than any adhesive can provide.  If you're lucky enough to be installing this on a block or brick surface, get your hands on a hammer drill.  You can get it done with a regular drill, but it will be agonizingly slow and frustrating.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2019"

I specifically wanted the spotlight to be able to capture color images but as you can see, the spotlight is not bright or strong enough to project long distances. I guess it would be good for an indoor space or some kind of small porch, but definitely not for yard lighting. I was severely disappointed in the bright intensity of the light, or lack thereof. Thankfully I had already purchased the flood light, and installing it next to the spotlight cam, you can obviously see the massive difference in lighting.

74,Caffaenated,Hard to dial in - Wired version works Brilliantly- Edited 4/11/19,"  Edit at bottom:So, I think I need to say that this review is based on my specific application.  I have a very short driveway and a street in front.  I tried desperately to dial in the activation zones so that the camera would turn on when someone entered my yard, but not when a car drove by.  Not a chance.At minimum setting, a person had to walk under the camera to activate.  Just a bit higher and it would record a car driving down the street, but wouldn't detect one pulling in the driveway.  Generally, if we came home and parked, got out and entered the house, the video would only show us getting out of the car.  Sometimes just the backs of our heads leaving the area.  Meanwhile the Ring Door Bell pick us up rounding the corner in perfect video.A bit higher on the sensitivity and it was going off every 10 minutes with movement in and across the street.I'm sure this would be different if it monitored a rear or side yard, and maybe a larger front yard and drive.  But I had to settle on shutting off my notifications.  Raising the sensitivity, and assuming if I had an issue, I can go back through the recordings and find what I needed.  It would be nice to have better control.Edit:  The Ring Team contacted me about my review.  The Battery Cam's sensor is a different technology than the Wired version.  The only way to get an exact perimeter for the sensor, was to upgrade to a wired version.  Which they offered to swap free of charge.  After the installation of the 120 volt version you can actually drag perimeter lines for the camera.  Even adding custom activation zones.  It works AMAZING!

75,Jose R. Angeles,U will need to pay subscription service for all features.,"  After your first three months of ownership are up, you will need to pay a subscription for cloud service to store/retrieve video. If you don't pay the fee, your $200.00 camera is just a live video camera without video storage. You can get one of those for about $50.00 or less.  I have a NAS server (essentially my own cloud server) I moved all my cloud data and device activity there so I don't have to pay fees and have more control.  Ring does not give you the ability to configure to any alternative NAS server like most cameras do. This is  big drawback.The video is slow to connect at times (my wifi is only 20 feet from the camera) and when I had the cloud service, it took forever to access stored data to the point that is was rendered useless. Now I am no longer sending data to the ring cloud, I notice  faster response times to the camera.Overall, the camera visibility is great and works well at night when triggered by motion. I purchased an extra battery and have not needed to charge the device in over four weeks now. I like the Ring, it is just that the price is too high to justify paying cloud fees to maintain basic functionality.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2020"
76,LOVE ALL,Buyer beware… This particular cam has a lot of problems,  Update: so despite spending 10 hours with Ring support making me jump through hoops issues with this camera. I have since got a wired one like I have in the front that works great and I’ve had no issues. The only issue is with this stick up cam and they should maybe be a little more forthcoming that you may not be able to access the live view from your Alexa echo or your phone app. The stick up will Alert you but you can’t see what’s out there using your echo or your phone so I guess decide how useful that is. Regardless they made me think that even if I got a wired one it still might have issues not true! I have two wired ones without a single problem the problem is with the stick up cam I say stay away from it you’re going to end up wasting many hours in sending it back.To summit up… Went through to stick up cam‘s eight hours of online support over five days and the final conclusion was that the stick up cam just don’t work with some peoples set ups. Now this was what is concerning because I don’t have a unique set up I just have an Xfinity modem and apparently this stick up cam doesn’t work with new Xfinity modem‘s and nobody can help you. After eight hours of actual on the phone time the final conclusion was to send both products back and there’s just no way I could use the stick up cam. The problem isn’t that it doesn’t work. It works it’s just that you can never have live view on your phone or the echo which pretty much makes it worthless. It will alert you still but you can’t see who it is unless you open the door and look again defeats the purpose of the product. I’m just really disappointed because I don’t have any special set up I have an average common every day Internet set up with extremely fast Internet and the stick up cam won’t work. I have a ring doorbell on the front it’s a hardwired one and we’ve never had any problems with that but just google stick up cam won’t show live view And you’ll see there are lots and lots and lots of people.

78,SMS,Not Good Enough to Protect You,"  Here's a few things I disliked: 1) I had to buy a signal amplifier in order to get my six Ring Cameras to work reliably. 2) the directions to the Ring Spotlight Cam are inadequate. They don't mention that you need to buy a $10 starburst, security tool in order to safely adjust the collar which holds the camera in place.The review is not all bad because I do like the fact that I can view the scene from my doors from anywhere. That said, my recordings of visitors & deliverymen often feature their backs as they are leaving instead of their faces as they arrive. Moreover, I don't like that continuous recording feature; all I want is the guy's face as he comes up to my door. Furthermore, I don't like the routine that we're put through in order to verify that we are the actual purchaser. I want to talk to a person right away via phone or chat.The reality of this is that Ring sent me some funky screw to hold the camera tight in the camera retaining ring. They should have mentioned that fact in the brochure. As it turned out, I was up on a ladder when I figured that out. Fixing that cost me time I don't have.In order to help everyone, take the collar to a hardware store & show them that funky security screw. Get them to sell you the appropriate screw removal tool and a small container of blue LockTite. You'll need both to a) remove the screw, and b) set it back in place.

82,Lauren Osborne,Mostly reliable (updated),"  I have one by my porch angled in such a way that my front door and driveway are covered by this cam. Ring is easy to deal with and user friendly. My only shortcoming to report is that at times the connection can drop leading to the cam needing a little bit longer to bring up a live feed or to start recording.Update: owning several of these ring security cams has provided my family with peace of mind. However, there are noticeable quirks that must be known before investing in these cams. Your WiFi must be strong and bandwidth has to be fast, especially with more than one camera. Placement of the cams will also hinder the signal strength. I had a few weeks where everything was recording in black, audio was fine but the picture was completely black. I have a repeater in my garage to help with the cams that are furthest away from my router. After calling Ring for some tech support all they could offer me in terms of help is to upgrade my internet speed or move the cams closer. Neither was an option as I already have the fastest internet speed that my cable company offers and moving my cam would not cover the area I want to watch. Really simple tech support that is always user error or “slow internet” it’s never the ring cam.The motion sensor on the cam is adequate at this price point. It is not highly sensitive nor completely numb. Having said that we have noticed that overcast can play tricks with the sensor. Rolling clouds on a sunny day will trip the sensors. The shade from the clouds and then sunlight once the clouds pass will set off all of your cams. We have 5 and all of them go off at the same time. Kind of annoying but now we know.Another quirk with the sensor is that small animals such as a cat or puppy will trigger a sensor one time and then on subsequent passings it will not. Same animal but will record when it feels like. I feel there is an overall lack of continuity with the sensor and what it chooses to record.I wish the cam would record longer than 30 seconds per event but I understand there is a limitation with this capacity due to conserving  battery power (ring tech told me this).The ring cam is good but not great. I wish ring tech support would actually help instead of blaming the user or saying “it’s your internet speed.” I’ve stopped emailing and calling ring tech support because all they do is blame those two things.I like having a visible camera to deter unwanted individuals. We’ve noticed that neighbors with other security systems with hidden cams have had some vandalism and thefts. Those systems also failed to record such events or do not record with clarity or provide a spotlight to scare people away.Price point could be a little cheaper but the annual membership/subscription fee is relatively low.I downgraded ring from 5 stars to 3 stars based on horrible tech support and some of the inconsistencies we have experienced.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2018"
83,Lauren Osborne,Garbage app and product,  This thing is garbage. It seems to work every now and then. Some days it catches motion and the other days it doesn't. The spotlight doesn't even turn on when my doorbell picks up the motion. Most of the motion is picked up by the door bell and this camera is linked to turn on. I bought ring because of the rant and rave and I wanted a camera doorbell. I had arlo pro 2 cams before and decided to go with the ring products and the service. I am going back to arlo and never messing with ring again.

84,Phil K.,Initially no so great but awesome customer support,"  The camera itself is fine but keeping it charged was a crap shoot. I have the original stick-up cam and the solar panel and had zero problems. I went to get another stick up cam a few years later and now it’s this big floodlight camera but whatever, I got it. Only then to realize the old solar panel jack doesn’t fit this camera so naturally I had to buy the new one. Anyway, this new solar panel has never charged or maintained the charge on my camera rendering it basically useless. Now I have to bring the battery inside periodically to charge it.  Not thrilled. The camera itself is good while it’s working but as soon as it loses charge and the battery has to be brought inside, it’s not useful anymoreRing got in touch and apparently the solar panel was a dud.

85,J. Hughes,I wouldn't recommend it,"  Seemed great at first, it was pretty easy to install... but I've never been able to get it to work properly. Nearly any time it records motion, all I get is a black screen. I've tried reinstalling, I bought a WiFi extender, I've updated it- nothing works. So, basically, I know the approximate TIME something happened in my yard, but I can't see what it was. Not very helpful. It's pretty arbitrary about connecting to live view, as well. Apparently, it works for other people, but I've spent time digging around the internet for solutions, and I'm not the only one with this problem. How much time and money am I supposed to spend on this thing? I wouldn't buy it again.EDIT: The button at the top no longer seems to work, so now I am unable to reset the camera, in an attempt to set it up from scratch.

86,Simon,The jury is out.,"  It's having some issues and Ring says the distance is too far from the WiFi AP. 30ft is not far, and I can stream video easily at 3x that with other devices.  Ring sent an extender (didn't need another WiFi source) that I placed half-way between the camera and the AP, and the signal is worse.Also, if you get an alert, the app will be missing the first 2-3 seconds of video.  if you source is a small animal like a cat, your video will have no indication of what triggered it.Claimed two way voice is just short of a bogus claim. It does work, provided the person is standing very close to the camera, facing it, and there is no background noise. Not usable unless you have a cooperative subject.Amazon Alexa integration is fair, at best. You view the camera from an Echo Show, but nothing more. No playback, no two way, etc. You can make it notify your Echo devices when there is a motion detected, but only ALL devices, ALL the time.  Very annoying for an Alexa household.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2019"
87,Diablo,Will you get one that works or that hasn't been opened?,"  I already owned one battery powered Ring spotlight cam and was very happy with it.  I ordered a second one and what a mess.  No matter what I did, the thing would give me a ""battery door open"" error.  I tried every single thing Ring suggested and nothing would work.  Additionally, the motion sensor/process did not seem to work either.  So, I requested a replacement and sent it back.  The replacement arrived and what do you know, it was open in the box.  I had hoped that the camera box had just popped open but when I checked it, there was dirt on the body of the camera and someone had removed and replaced the protective film on the bottom of it.  I requested a refund and sent it back.  Doing some research, it appears this ""battery door open"" problem is quite common and folks don't seem to have much luck getting any useful help from Ring in resolving the issue short of returning the camera and getting a new one that, hopefully, works.  As concerns the open box, what the heck is with Amazon?  Why send me an open box when I've paid for something new?  I am going to guess (hope) this was a secondary provider who thought he could pull a quick one.  And lastly, what the heck is going on with the box?

88,Thriller Fan,"Not quite as advertised, but not too bad","  I think I remember reading somewhere that the battery lasts a month. It does not -- at least mine does not -- but it does last for roughly 3 weeks as long as no one spends all of their time playing with the camera. I have purchased a second battery so that I can swap them out when the one in use gets low. In addition, there is a delay between someone walking into range and the camera sending an alert to my phone. When a family member approaches the house, they are through the front door and inside the house before I ever get an alert on my phone. I don't consider this to be a big deal, though, because when someone else, such as an Amazon delivery person dropping off a package, walks up to the door, a do get an alert in time to stop them from leaving before they are gone, if I need to. The night vision is good within the immediate range but is not effective beyond a dozen feet or so. The daylight picture is excellent, and the lights are very good at turning the night vision picture into one that is almost as good as daylight.

I'm not sure how Ring got such a ""great"" reputation with the junk they are making.I bought the door bell, security system, and two cameras on Prime Day. Since receiving the equipment, I've had to make six calls to tech support because the equipment constantly malfunctions.This particular camera didn't come with the installation QR code. It wasn't in the box, nor was it printed inside the battery bay. The only way to install it was to make a long phone call to Ring.Then the camera only works when in my living room directly next to the router.Unfortunately, it worked while I was testing it and while I was positioning it to mark for where I was going to mount it.So now that I've drilled holes in the side of my house and mounted the camera, it doesn't work.Apparently, tech support gets a lot of these phone calls. Each and every representative said to me multiple times, ""I can understand how you would feel that way."" They say this exact phrase even when I haven't said I'm frustrated or angry or anything. Seriously, I told tech support that the QR code was missing from the camera, and she said, ""I can understand how you'd feel that way. I'd feel the same way.""

90,Bob,Not worth the money if you want continuous recording.,"  I’m not gonna lie, the ring cameras are great for someone who doesn’t care for continuous recording. I’ve owned them since 2018 and I’ve had a lot of small house and car break ins around where I live and this camera is not what I wanted. The recording time of only 30 seconds is straight up garbage. Even with the snapshots every minute does nothing good. I unfortunately have to stick ring cause I got sucked into the ring ecosystem, I got two cameras, and a doorbell and a 100$ annual subscription fee which isn’t bad but the fact that they don’t include continuous recording is just awful. Nest cameras on the other hand have continuous recording so I’m looking to upgrading to nest once my subscription expires.To quickly sum up my rant.This camera will not help in capturing crimes.

Little did I know you still have to pay monthly subscription for it, if you don’t  you cant see any videos it captured before, you can only watch live footage! So lets say someone stole something or someone came to your front door. It wont let you see the video it captured so once you go live that person is gone! So lets say someone stole something you have no video evidence to prove that person stole something from your yard. This is ridiculous, not sure why its $200 but yet you have yo pay a subscription. It’s completely pointless and defeats the purpose. You are better off buying a cheaper camera that doesn't have a subscription.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2021"
92,Win,I really wanted to like it.,"  I'll be glad to review this again if things change. I purchased this because I like the alarm features. I did some reviews and watched YouTube videos about them so pulled the trigger. There was mixed information on whether or not videos can be kept if you do not have a subscription. I thought once it is on your phone then you basically have it, but this is not the case. I guess the main point for this review is to say the camera kept freezing the picture and then I would have to rejoin live view. I did find that somehow even though I couldn't see it on my phone that it did still keep recording. I know someone will ask about my WIFI and I checked it and made sure it was strong and there was no interference. I also found the view when I did see it was ""walleyed-goggle eye"" whatever you want to call it. So I have my trial now and basically, it has been no good to me. I have Blink cameras and the main reason I wanted to go to this was because of the different alert settings/sounds that it offers whereas Blink does not. So yeah, the only reason I gave it 3 stars was because it seems well built although heavier than other cameras in the market and because of the mentioned alarm features.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2021"
93,Trish005,This is a city review,"  So I live in the city first and foremost... In my opinion, these are not designed for city use because the motion detection picks up way too much to the point you don't even bother checking the alerts at times. I have it on people only mode but it still picks up when a car goes by and things like that. Pretty annoying and it drains the battery. I don't really think there's a way around that which is okay. My biggest issue with the ring camera is that it doesn't constantly record like I had hoped. It records up to 60 seconds of motion and to me that's pointless. For example, Someone walks by and stands around by your car. Camera stops recording because where it has that timer... So if I go outside and my car is destroyed I will not have much proof if my $200 security camera didn't record the entire thing. I also pay for the storage space, What's the sense? This camera really does nothing for my needs. The night vision is ""Meh"" to say the least. You can barely see license plates, People don't show up that well. I guess if it's close to where the motion will be happening it would be very good such as right beside the front door but I have mine above the front door angeling towards the street (I only bought this to keep an eye on the family's cars)... You really can't see much at night in my opinion especially for a $200 camera. Now since I talked about the motion constantly going off (I understand this is because I'm in the city) just keep in mind this DRAINS the battery. My battery was fully charged when I installed it, I've had it about a week and it's already pretty much dead. That's annoying. I expected much more from this camera. I've also noticed when you set the alarm off (I did this for fun with a family member) you cannot hear the alarm going off on the ring app, And when the alarm is going off you can no longer hear anything.... I'm not crazy about that. The spotlight is very bright but to me it doesn't do much to really affect the camera quality. In my opinion, I wouldn't recommend this camera to anyone in the city, I'm sure if you live in a house somewhere it serves the purpose but if you're someone from the city considering this camera? I wouldn't do it unless you have money for either the solar battery charger (Which to me defeats the purpose of having a descret camera) or extra batteries. If I had it my way I'd return this and buy the security system I originally had my eyes on, I only went with ring because it's so popular. Not a fan.

96,Lee Philips,"Not a great camera, worse company, DO NOT GET FOR COLD CLIMATE","  I have a couple of issues with this company and camera.1) do not get this if you line in a cold climate area. If the temperature does below 10 degrees F, the battery is too cold to function. I would have hoped that this wouldn't be an issue on an outdoor camera.2) motion sensing is sometimes way too sensitive, and sometimes not sensitive enough. Today, it's gone off 15+ times in three hours for absolutely no reason. A few days ago, it didn't even start recording until a truck was fully parked in our driveway....3) we get more recordings of the neighborhood cats than the people who walk by our front yard. I get that it's a lot to ask for a camera to not pick up small animals, but it's still an issue.4) the cost.... The camera is already kind of expensive, but in addition you have to pay for a monthly subscription of $10/month to have any videos recorded. If you don't pay, there's no way to locally save the videos. You only get access to live feed. If you want to have another camera, the cost goes up to $25/mo which is pretty overpriced when you've already given them up words of $300 just for the cameras.5) I take issue with the fact that even though I pay a monthly fee to have access to the videos recorded from the camera, if I ""answer"" the video, it is not recorded. So if I want to look to see if the video being recorded is in fact someone hopping my fence (other than the neighbor's cat), and I happen to see a person... Well, I've just erased the evidence that I'd like to provide to the police.6) I don't feel secure in this camera being set up to my wifi. What are the chances that a company that is so careless with so many other things is going to have good security that protects my network? I've set it up on a separate secure network, and I would recommend others do the same. And I would NEVER ever consider getting their indoor cameras....I'm really not happy with this buy, but at this point I'm out the money for the camera, the solar panel, and the monthly fees I've already paid into it. If I decide to get rid of the whole setup, I'm not getting that back. Waste is money. I'm very disappointed.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2021"

98,Stringy,Buy the Wired version if possible!,"  I bought this camera in July of 2018.  For the most part, it does its job but the wired version seems more fully featured, has a better picture and avoids issues faced by the battery one.  I was hoping to wait for their next update of the spotlight camera before picking up a wired one but more problems with battery one prompted me but a wired one on the Black Friday discount.First, Ring in general.  I received a Pro doorbell as a gift.  I had considered some cameras because I am away a fair amount and I also liked the idea of their alarm system which was still fairly new.  I had ADT and was fed up with their antiquated equipment, expensive monthly service (about $50/mo) and the fact they charged for every service call.  The Ring system offered more complete coverage, more up to date equipment and had a low monthly fee for monitoring and online recording.After installing the doorbell and finding it useful, I decided I wanted a front camera that covered the driveway and a back camera that covered my rear doors.  The Spotlights were on sale but you could only get the discount for one of each so I picked up on wired and one battery.  I mounted the wired one in back because there was a handy outlet.  The battery one was mounted out front.The rear, wired one has always been very responsive and provides a great picture.  It is about twice the distance from my wifi access than the front camera.  The only issue I have found is that it is still very sensitive even with the settings set as low as possible.  It doesn't seem to know the difference between a human and a small cat or squirrel.The front, battery one has always had some issues.  It constantly has connection issues even when I purchased a chime pro.  The chime pro is maybe 6 feet from it with a window between them.  I always get a poor connectivity message in the app.  Next, they updated the app several months or maybe a year ago to give you a pop up when you linked to the device that asks if you are unhappy about the battery performance.  I'm not and have to batteries in it so I don't have this issue but there is no way to make it stop with the pop up.  This is the camera I use to see who is out front.  The pop up delays the response and I find that if someone is walking up they are already past the camera by the time I selected view and then closed the pop up about battery issues.  Now, it has decided the battery door is open and will indicate there are no batteries.  This is not the case.  The case was closed, it has two fresh batteries, it managed to take a picture of me trying to find the problem and seems to work fine from the website just not from the app.I will not buy another battery operated camera from them.

99,Glenn E. Smith,Update: Ring redeems themselves after losing the most critical videos needed and paid for,"  Update: via Ring app chat on Saturday I was able to get ahold of a Ring technical support representative. Christine did a great job of explaining why my Ring Extender wasn't working with my Ring Spotlight Camera. The Ring Extender only works with the alarm system components like the motion detectors, door and window sensors, etc. In order to get a camera extended you need to buy the Ring Chime which will extend the wifi to a remote camera. Now it makes sense to me, but I needed to buy another component. Since she understood the confusion and my frustration she ended up offering to send me a Chime free of charge! This poor wifi signal is what caused all of my video and connectivity problems, and the extender vs chime only working with alarm system vs camera systems explains why I still couldn't get a good connection even with the extender.First Ring Spotlight Camera worked great. 2nd camera wouldn't activate the spotlight at any time, no matter how many settings were activated. Camera originally working well was moved into the driveway from the front door but has a ton of problems recording video or uploading them to ""the cloud"". Two dozen recordings today that were not recorded, yet those are the ones I need to locate $200 worth of stolen equipment right from under the camera.

They don't tell you that up front.So if you don't pay the extorted monthly charge, the system is useless as far as I'm concerned.Yes, you can remotely view a live cams of house on your phone at any time but who has time to constantly monitor their premises like a security firm.And, if some trips your doorbell or other security cams, you will get an alert on you phone,BUT by the time you go to the live cam view to see who's there and interact with them like they show on TV,they are long gone.

101,Felipe Moreno,Great Camera - Till Your Wifi Information Needs to be Changed!,"  I installed this camera about 6 months ago. It works OK. Motion detection is fine night vision is very grainy. However, there is one show stopper. If you change your WiFi system, you will need to reset the ring camera to setup your new WiFi settings ... but guess what... In order to reset the camera you have to press a button on the Camera. Most people mount these cameras up high, and will need a ladder to do the reset. I cannot get up on a ladder, so a visit from my handyman is $90. Other camera models allow setup by Bluetooth. Ring needs to add this feature to their camera models.Update July 2020 - My camera has been offline since February. With CV19 it took till now to get a handy man out to reset the camera so it could be re-paired to my Wifi system. It was suggested to me that I add a second chime-pro for this camera which I did. The second chime pro is literally 12 feet and one wood/siding wall from the camera, but the signal strength is still poor.So the handyman leaves and I decided to see if I could tell which of my chime pro units the camera is connected with. The Ring app does not tell you that! It will allow me to switch it to my wifi network... But to initiate that change, the camera needs to be reset, which means for me ANOTHER HANDYMAN VISIT.This is ridiculous! I am lowering my review. I will not purchase another Ring product.

I got this camera as a perimeter camera so I wouldn’t need to supply it with 120v.

I wanted to be able to capture one-way traffic and illegal turn violators and all I get is great video of my wind blowing Palo Verde tree and happy birds.

104,Lexie,Ring Wireless Outdoor Security Camera,"  We have hens. I have found it useful to keep a security camera in the coop to be alerted if vermin or predators show up. Over a couple of years we had a couple of wired cameras with the cord stretched across the yard to an outlet, which, in South Florida where we are, pretty quickly got incorporated under the grass and soil as life grew over them. But (our fault), in our situation the cameras shorted out during storms because occasionally the plug-end would come loose, and get wet, and electricity just doesn't work well in that condition. So enough of the wires. It's 2020 for goodness sakes.This model Ring, of course, is wireless, so great! One problem solved. Image in daylight is very clear and wide. Image with night vision, when we really want it, is good, but not A+ best. But good. And the motion detector does notice if something moves through the coop in the night, the test being when one hen moved from her spot on the roost to another spot when the settings were on medium detection. I have boosted the camera to maximum detection to make sure to catch whatever unwelcome little things might skitter through. I'm confident any big things will be noted. I can't WAIT to set off the siren on them.This model Ring is very customizable compared to my other brand of security camera. I like that. It was easy to install (the package even comes with an installation tool). The wifi signal, although across the yard and through concrete walls, gets a solid connection with our modem-router, which I appreciate. The app is straight forward and works well on a Fire Tablet and Android phone. I can't get it to work at all on my PC, however.I might add the solar panel to keep it charged and fuss-free, but even the one battery set (it holds two) holds a charge quite well as I keep turning the Live View on and off, because *new toy*.It's not a perfect security camera. The night vision quality could be improved. And getting the app to work on the PC would be useful.

I am not in to paying monthly payments, so don't like that aspect at all. If you sign up and pay then it will record to the cloud so that you have a record of activity. Otherwise nothing. Motion detection is very poor for such an expensive instrument. I can walk around the corner of the garage and toward the front door, a distance of about 25 feet and it won't pick me up until I'm nearly at the door. Too slow. Meanwhile a vehicle can pass by on the street 75 feet away and it picks that up. When I have notifications turned on to my cell phone I get all these ""motion at your front door"" notifications on my phone which are nothing but a vehicle passing by. Irritating.

If the LED lights aren't on the video quality is almost useless. Images are blurred and difficult to identify.Daytime video is not that great either when compared to the Arlo Pro 2 or even the Ring Floodlight. Colors appear washed out.Ring charges a premium price for the hardware but the video is not worth it.I am returning this product and looking elsewhere.The only thing I can recommend is that it works with the Ring chime. This allows me to know that there is movement without have to carry my smartphone when I'm at home.Update:Originally I had issues with the video quality of the Ring Spotlight camera. I was contacted by Alexis with Ring’s customer service. The support I received was excellent. Alexis offered a number of possible solutions to resolve the problem. I couldn’t be happier with the quality of support I received. I definitely will remain a loyal customer and recommend Ring devices to others.No camera system is perfect, but if problems arise, it’s the customer support that really makes the difference.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2018"
109,KBC,DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON - Arrived Used / Tampered With.,"  I purchased 1x Ring Spotlight Cam Battery, and I am overly dissatisfied and disappointed. I had received a Product with Scratches, and everything was just crammed into the box, as if it was used. There was no protective covering on the camera lens (as shown in YouTube unboxing’s) and there was a defect with the siren not being loud at all. The camera itself is clear, and the two way talk works flawlessly. I love how bright the spotlight is as well. Ring had thankfully replaced the Cam after showing proof. I had also gotten a $50 credit from Amazon for the inconvenience. I am beyond surprised how this could even happen! Nowhere in this listing says that this Cam is anything but new. This is something that gets companies sued! You cannot sell a “new” product and send it off used. I will never ever buy anything related to Ring products from Amazon ever again!",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2020"
110,D. Landers,Does NOT work with 5G!  Great camera otherwise!,"  The stick up cams are not compatible to 5G yet.  I did not realize this until after I purchased it.  Some reviews stated it works.  It does not.  They either do not understand the reason theirs is working, or they do not understand what the 5G is exactly.  According to Ring, all are only 2G for now.  I did add the Ring chime Pro and it allowed all of my 2G and 5G products to work perfectly.  It rings for my Ring doorbell and alerts.  I used a gutter hing to hang my camera.  It is perfect.  The siren, lights, detection and functions are spot on.  It took me all of 5 minutes to program and install.

111,JULES PARDO,One fatal flaw that invalidated the Camera,"  I am a big fan of Ring products. We already have four, across their spectrum of doorbell, floodlight, and indoor ring cams.I will come straight to the point. Depending on how this camera is mounted, an intruder can easily remove the battery without being detected. Ring customer service conceded this point, and said they will be working on modifying this camera to prevent it. It might not affect you depending on where and how you mount it, but to me, it was obvious that someone can come behind it, reach up, press a button to open the battery compartment at the bottom, and out drops the battery or batteries (if you installed two batteries in it).This needs to be fixed. Period. I am still befuddled at how this went past design discussions.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2019"

Great products, incredible customer service, 6 star if I could give it!Original post:  Great Camera, loved everything about it, but one day about a month ago while changing out a battery to charge, the whole camera fell out of its mount onto the ground, and although there is no visible damage, it now no longer works.

113,Sean,Did a different engineering team design this camera?,"  I recently purchased a Ring 2 doorbell and that has to be one of the easiest and most user friend camera/door bell in existence.  It does everything it was designed to do with no issues whatsoever.Now as far as the Ring spotlight camera (battery), it promises a lot plus if the Ring Doorbell 2 was so great one would expect the spotlight camera to at least be close.  Sorry to say it isn't.  I installed it today (very easy install and directions have me awarding it at least two stars), but everything else is a disappointment.  Here are the issues I have with it:1.  Inconsistent motion detection.  It will detect cars moving on the street, but won't pick anyone walking up the driveway from the sidewalk.  You cannot adjust it out because the only option on the ring spotlight camera (battery) is ""sensitivity"".  I would think it would pick up movement closer to the camera, but it doesn't.2.  Even excellent wifi coverage (I get usually 35up/125down as that is my work from home requirement for my job) has no affect on the constant ""poor signal"" warning popping up on the app.  My Ring 2 is on the same side of the house (just further away by about 20 feet) and it gets better reception while being further away from the router. The spotlight camera is less then 5 feet away from the router).3.  When it does managed a motion (like a car 30 feet away) the recording starts when the cars is almost out of the screen.  Car is going 10mph and I have about a 75 front section at my house, but the spotlight camera cannot even get half of the event recorded.  My ring 2 doorbell does a better job and it is at the end of the front of my home (it can record the whole event..well perhaps like 80%...which is still better then the 15% the spotlight records.4.  When bringing up an alert the live view just freezes and never connects.  I have no problem connecting to my Ring 2 and that is further away from the router (that's frustrating).I really wanted to like this camera, but after a whole day of trouble shooting, repositioning the mount on my freshly stuccoed house (not happy with that), tilting the camera up and down...it still has the same issues.  Not sure if this is a bad one or if this is a bad design for a camera.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2020"
114,crabapple,Issue with Battery Door,"  I have 6 of the Ring Spotlight camera already install around my house for years. I decided to buy a 7th for an area that currently isn't covered by my other cams. When I got the latest one from Amazon, installed camera and did normal setup and noticed it kept saying the battery door was open ( it wasn't but it was saying it was). So open and closed it like 10 times and nothing. Removed batteries and uninstalled/ reinstalled and nothing works. So, I return that one back to Amazon and get a replacement. Get that one in yesterday and is doing the exact same thing. So I finally gave in and called RING support and we went through the troubleshooting, uninstalled/reinstalled app even. Nothing worked. The tech goes and consults another tech and finds out that Amazon has got a bad batch of these and this is one of the reported issues is. So, now Ring is having me send this one back to them and they are sending me another one straight from Ring.

At times you need to see the live view, 90% you see the spinning ""activating device..."" long enough till you have no need to see the live view or it simple the app showing ""cannot connect"". We have mesh wifi all over around the house, so the connection is not the issue. Read some where stating ring cameras have low processing power, it cannot do two things same time.

116,M Gerrish,customer service and overall quality,"  I am not one to ever write and bash a product. In this case, however, I feel it is important to let readers know -especially since many of us use these reviews to make purchasing decisions. This device has been a headache on enough occasions that with the latest issue, I've had enough and have purchased the new camera from Simplisafe, which is already my primary security system.Below are the problems I've experienced since purchasing this system (which had an added solar panel):1) any disruption or change in the internet has resulted in a MINIMUM of an hour, multiple phone calls, and long wait times to resolve. The first person to answer the call always goes through the same process that most of us try before calling (take out battery, reboot, re-do the set up).  When it is clear this won't work (by this time you are already 40 minutes into your call, including wait time, holds, transfers), you are then transferred to the technical people (who you thought you were on hold for in the first place!).The technical person takes you through the same steps again. Then adds a few more. If lucky, the issue is resolved. If not, another call is required, same process, and maybe this time a person answers who can take you through the simple fix, which literally you could have done yourself if the information was available online. By now, you are over an hour on the phone, spending time climbing up and down a ladder (to access the device).2) When the doorbell rings, the ring camera hasn't even notified me that someone is there because there is a big lagtime. In order to see who is at the door, I have to wait until the ""live view"" fires up. None of the ""live view"" stuff is recorded. What is the point? On more occasions than I care to count, I've had to go to the door without knowing who is on the other side of it.3) Latest issue: a few weeks ago, recordings and notifications started to stop at 7 PM and do not resume until 6 AM. A call placed to the help line (same process and timing involved as above) ended in ""well, you have to call back when the problem is going on"". This, after the same 40 minutes spent holding, etc.  Call back?? The very last thing I want to do at 8 PM after a long day of work is haul out my ladder and fiddle around with this device. Bye bye Ring.  By the way, I've tried every solution to this current issue that I was able to find online. It seems to be that  this is a common issue. For me, it just began out of the blue a few weeks ago.  One of the main uses for the camera, as we all know, is to watch the front door.  If this isn't working in the middle of the night, what is the point?Bottom line: do not buy unless you like endless fiddling and long wait times. There are less expensive and better items available.Sorry to rant, but I would want to see this review if I were considering plunking over $250 again. (camera plus solar panel). The new camera I am ordering is 2/3 of the price and has many more options included.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2021"
117,DrB,Only records for 20 seconds,"  Amazon, in their quest to increase the battery life of this device has decreed that it will only record for twenty seconds after motion is detected.  This means that once the camera is initially activated it will only record for 20 seconds.  So basically, you can see the beginning of an issue on your property, but not the middle or the end.This is a huge negative for a product like this.  Based on my conversation with support, Amazon has no intentions of changing this any time soon.Other than that, it's a good camera, motion detection works well as does the night vision.  Was easy to install.  Only returning due to the absolute abysmal record length.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2019"
118,quilt artist,Great but not perfect,"  I live in a quiet residential neighborhood (all SFH) and every few months vandals pop in and spend a week or two breaking into or stealing cars and then they move on to another neighborhood.I have (wired) security cameras around the house that I really like, but my house is set back from the street and the cameras don’t capture street activity really clearly. So I mounted this Ring camera on a tree about 5-feet from the street.Pros: During the day the clarity is amazing. I can clearly see faces, make/model of cars, and read license plates. The camera is super easy to set up. The app is super easy to use. It has great features (privacy zones, motion schedule, neighborhood sharing, alarm, etc). When a person/car enters the zone at night a bright light turns on, which is a great deterrent.Cons: I currently only have 1 battery pack and it needs to be recharged every 4-5 days. The coverage area has a fair amount of activity (kids playing in the street, people walking dogs, Amazon delivery trucks driving by, etc) but it is a quiet side street in a sleepy residential neighborhood. The camera is mounted up high so dragging a ladder out and dismantling the camera every 4 days is not sustainable, especially if there is snow or ice. Also, it takes 6+ hours to fully charge so for the bulk of the day the camera is out of commission. At night the clarity could be better.I love, love, love everything this camera but it’s just not sustainable for me to recharge the battery every 4-5 days. I’ve just ordered a second battery pack. If that doesn’t significantly extend time between charges I am probably going to return it.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2020"
119,Everett Garwood,Not happy. Night capture mode has lots of issues.  Motion detection is subpar.,"  Night capture mode is terrible. I put the cam up at the corner of my house under the awning, which is not visible in the picture but at night the IR feedback is so bad from surrounding surfaces it over exposes and you can't see much past 10 feet. Someone told me to put tape over the IR lights which worked like a champ, but then the problem is it also covers up the spotlight.  So I had to find a compromise where I covered the IR lights as much as possible and the spotlight as little as possible but since they are tin the same place the IR light bleeds through too much.The second issue is that the motion detection is terrible. For some reason it won't detect a car pulling into the driveway right in front of it, but it will constantly trigger when shadows move on the ground or leaves get in front of it. It also triggers motion alerts on the street even though my zone ends at the side walk. I also found when I come back from my jogs it never even detects me, because I came up to the house too fast?  The settings for this thing are black box and I'm not sure what they really do they just seem to have a mind of their own.  I have tried ever setting, poured over reddit and help forums but it seems like there are only 3 settings to this thing. Capture absolutely everything,  Capture a lot of nothing but occasionally capture something.  Capture absolutely nothing.The other day someone was reeling their dog out to take a crap on my yard it never detected. I saw it because I was in the garage, I went back to history and sure enough it never registered even though it was a person with their legs walking through my motion zone and a dog running around right in front of the camera didn't trigger.  3 minutes later a car drives by... out of my motion zone and it triggers.  I really don't get this thing.  I will not buy another.  The most solid Ring product is the door bell 2nd Gen. Battery life is about 3 weeks which is low but tolerable for how many times it turns on to capture leaves and shadows.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2022"
120,Clyde Dog,Good for spots you don’t have good lighting,"  I had bought this camera and the ring stick up cam to see which camera worked best for me and I chose the ring stick up cam. I like that this camera has a spotlight attached to it already, but since I already have motion sensor lights in the area that the camera is at, there was no point having a camera with the light. During the day the ring stick up cam has a better picture than this camera but obviously because of the spotlight at night this camera has a better picture than the ring stick up cam. If you have motion sensor lights with the ring stick up cam then the picture is better than the spotlight camera.The alarm on the spotlight camera was really loud and I liked that feature about it, but the app would need to load quicker for me to ever be able to use it if I saw something bad happening.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2020"
121,UrAverageReviewer,Works...okay in very specific circumstances,"  I develop properties and I have installed many Ring Spotlight cameras. Most are the hard wired variety, I have a couple that plug in, and I attempted a go at this battery powered one for one of my rentals. It does have the advantage of not needing power to be run to it, but the functionality compared to the others is quite lacking.Let's talk about the differences between this battery unit and the powered ones.A powered cam is recording all the time, and when it senses motion, it will start the archived video a few seconds before the motion is sensed. That means you'll see the mailman get out of his truck and walk up to the door to drop the mail, all very clear. The battery powered one waits till it sees motion, then boots up and starts recording, so you see the mailman closing the mailbox and walking away. You never see his face. I mean that's fine for the mailman but if it's a robber you've just missed your chance to identify the person. It's also fuzzy for the first half second, so you miss that time as well.The motion zone function is gimped compared to the powered cams. You can select from three motion zones, but you cannot adjust the distance. This works fine in a doorway or walkway where you have a limited area that people will be walking in, but it won't cover a back yard or a driveway. You have to wait until the person gets up to the door before it will sense the motion. In the powered spotlight cam, you can select the motion zone precisely, and set it for far longer distances.Not to say this is a poor product. Ring's software is great, the kit is very complete with tools, mounting hardware, etc. Everything works well and is of high quality. Battery life is as good as they say, with a good wi-fi connection 6 months is totally possible. However, if you have any way to run power I would very much recommend upgrading to the plug in or ""mount"" hardwire spotlight cam as they work far better.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2020"
122,Elynoon,Not Reliable,"  I’ve had this camera for about 2 1/2 years.  The first problem I have with all my outside cameras ( I also have 3 floodlight cameras) is the latency issue. When the cameras pick up motion there is a 7 to 8 second delay before it sends a notification to my IPhone or my IPad or any of the Alexa devices I use so when someone pulls into my driveway there at my door before I get notified so don’t count on them to save your life if that’s what you’re looking for.  This battery powered camera I have over my driveway and I have way too many connection problems with it when I’m trying to use it, I’d say about 50% of the time I can’t pull up a live view when I want to. I have Comcast gig internet and the camera is no more 30 feet away. But my biggest gripe about this camera is as soon as the temperature drops below 40 degrees I start losing charge even with having a solar charger attached to it. I live in Pennsylvania and right now it’s about 30 degrees and my camera has a 6% charge and no live view available. It did the same thing last year and it will probably stay like this until the temp goes back up in March or April.  Once these cameras are gone I’ll probably switch to another brand, I don’t think they’re worth the money.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2021"
123,Anil R. Pillai,A little expensive but overall a great camera,"  This camera/spot light was a bit pricey, so I was expecting a lot when I paid up to get it. Overall I'm quite happy with it, with a couple of minor quips. I bought the second battery, which was also a little pricey. I mounted it in a location that requires a ladder, so I wanted as much battery longevity as I could get. I did not get the solar panel since I wanted to keep it as incognito as I could. I did not want to get HOA approval to put up a camera. So the good and the bad. The day time picture quality is good. I love the zoom feature of the image. Gen 3 ring users will know what I'm talking about. I also love the ability to set up odd shaped motion zones. It's a bit difficult to explain but if you need to set up a motion zone that is not a perfect rectangle, this works fantastic. I also like the person only motion detection. This is great if you have pets roaming around the back yard. Ok now for the sorta bad. The area I have my camera mounted is fairly dark at night. The night vision is only so so. My gen 3 ring door bell is much better. When the spot light activates its better but I'm still a little disappointed. Occasionally I will get a false activation from motion outside the prescribed motion zone or even though I have person only mode on I will get a false activation from my pets. Generally speaking, I'm quite happy with my purchase and if I ever need another one I would buy it again.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2020"
124,Chris G,"Two tidbits, works great","  Works pretty well. I wanted to highlight two things: like others, I promptly lost the set screw that tightens the collar on the mount so the camera doesn’t move or fall off. The “extra” screws that come in the install kit do NOT work for this. My bodybuilder husband decided he could muscle them in and it turns out he cannot and the camera fell 9’ onto the pavers instead. One button snapped off but the camera works fine and some Gorilla tape fixed the button, so I’m fairly impressed with the durability. I tried Walmart for a replacement screw and that also failed. Learn from my mistake - go to the official Ring store and for $1.99 you can buy a spare parts package that contains the collar and screw. That would have been far easier and cheaper. Second learning is about the WiFi. I put it overlooking our pool on the outside eaves and it was choppy, didn’t work, and bad sound. I bought the Chime Pro and put it on the wall inside the house by the camera, solved the issue. Once the Chime Pro is set up via the app, i thought it would automatically connect and it didn’t. I found you have to go into the camera advanced settings directly and switch the network to be the Chime instead of my WiFi. Once I did that, it worked perfectly and the quality is great. Like others, the volume on the camera needs to be louder - you cannot hear unless standing right by it, but all in all we are happy. I added in the Echo Show 8 this weekend and love how it all connects and allows me to see what is going on.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2020"

It's close to a 5, however there are a couple little quirks.Positives:1) Great picture quality2) Pretty good audio quality3) Records all movement. It picks up animals and people very well. Very few false alarms, less than one/week.4) Battery life is surprisingly good. I only have one battery, bought a charger cord backup, but so far haven't installed it as I find the battery lasts for a couple months, even in cold weather. Pleasant surprise!5) Links well with my Pixel Phone and the interactive feature is good once connected.6) Night lighting is very effective for night recording.Negatives:1) It's a bit laggy as far as response time from the alert to getting a view of whoever is at the door. I have a great internet connection, so that's not the issue.2) Only records 2 minutes at a time and the lag between can sometimes miss other activity.3) Setup was NOT easy. Kind of a pain actually, but I was eventually able to get things going after an hour or so.4) Solar charger is not a good option for a covered porch application.

Maybe if I turned the settings all the way down on motion detection and so forth it would last longer, but it's pretty disingenuous to advertise the battery life as being something when that's not on standard settings. Also, in the morning between 4am to around 7am there is a foggy tint on the camera. If anyone were to break in it would alert the motion but you wouldn't be able to see any definition on the suspect.

134,Jfh,front door,"  Its ok. It senses when I'm right up against the front door, but no sooner. You can adjust the sensing range though, and after I fixed it, it will detect you from further out. The response is delayed about a few seconds. And even further delayed on the cellphone. I did a few hacks on it with help from Ring customer service, and it sped it up about 5 seconds.And it doesn't sense after I walk away and then turn around and come back. The camera point of view is wide almost fish eyed so expect it to be skewed. It sees ok in the dark.

135,Robert Bichon,A cheap ploy to get a monthly fee out of users,"  I am disgusted with the fact that these products worked great until I decided not to purchase additional monthly services. I had ZERO connectivity issues until I chose to forgo the additional monthly fees (they give a free trial). Immediately upon the end of the trial period, the product has consistent had connectivity issues and doesn't work as intended. I get notification on movement, but when I try and pull up the live feed to see what it is, I am told the conductivity is poor and the feed will not load. This was never a problem until I passed on the additional monthly fees. To that point I loved the product and its capabilities, but now I see it for wait it is: This is a cheap ploy to squeeze another subscription out of people.

136,MelissaM,"Great product, with a major flaw. Sending it back to Amazon.","  As a huge proponent of Ring products, I am sad to have to write this review. The camera works great overall, but has one massive flaw. First the good, the video and audio quality are great. The issue, is that it is impossible to turn off the camera through the app. The only way to turn off the camera is to physically remove the batteries from the device. For some, this may not be a dealbreaker...for me, it definitely is. Why you ask - this camera is mounted in the living area in my home. That means both batteries need to be recharged every few days, and everything that happens in my living room is being recorded - even when I don't want it to be. The most frustrating part is that it took some time to figure out that this was happening. Despite turning all three motion zones off, the camera continues being activated by every movement. Once again, this may not be a dealbreaker for everyone depending on how you are utilizing the camera, but it is for me. I'll be returning this to Amazon and looking for a product that have a usable interface.  May even switch over to a different video doorbell so that I don't have to pay for two separate cloud video storage accounts.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2018"
137,Eric Chen,Motion detection is totally out of whack,"  When first purchased and installed the device, motion detection were PERFECT, never have any false detection, fast and precise.  Until recently, some ring update (March/2020), with more features for motion detection, supposed to be better, but that made it worst, totally out of whack.  The new update makes my motion trigger every car goes by.  That says, it detects across my 4-car garage-wide driveway, plus a yard, plus a 6-foot wall, plus a green belt, then the street.  If I turn down the sensitivity, then it won't even detect my own car in my drive way, or send me a notification 5 minutes later.  Why does it detect something that is 600 feet away but won't detect anything within 100 feet?  Ridiculous and useless.  I need short range detection.

The mount on this camera is terrible. The extension that connects to the wall mount is so short you can’t tilt the camera down because the camera hits the wall.

However if it is raining or even worse snowing, these camera becomes useless. I have contacted Ring for suggestions and they have no real answers, reading on the support group it seems that others also have the same issue. The front lens will blur or build up as there is no protection against the weather and once it blurs your camera basically becomes useless until weather is clear and the stuff dries off. I have tried cleaning it and protecting with Rain-X and didn't really help.I also have one mounted inside my Garage to monitor Amazon Key drop off service, in such case it works fine.Its too bad Ring has not thought of all weather conditions and build a version that is more durable when it is raining or snowing.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2020"
142,Britany F,Missing event video (and it just happens to be a break-in),"  I have had my Ring spotlight cam for a year now and have found having it comforting, although fortunately any real need to have it hasn't occurred. Until today. A burglar entered our residence through the front door. We confronted her in the act of stealing laptops, she had been outside our house in the morning and entered into it when the door was left temporarily unlocked. Fortunately one of us was home and upon encountering her after hearing the door open, she dropped the laptops she was trying to steal and left the house. We called the police shortly thereafter and they were able to apprehend the thief.The police asked us to check the Ring for the video evidence. To my surprise, there was all the video after the thief came in, including the police coming, and there was video taken prior from the night before, but no video of the actual thief entering the house. WTF?!? The one time we really needed the Ring for its intended purpose, and it failed.I then chatted with Ring support to see if it was possible to retrieve it, and was told no, if it didn't register . as a motion triggered event, no video was recorded nor retrievable. The rep pointed the finger at it being a slow internet connection to the Ring, and that this could cause some videos to not be recorded. Hmm, ok, then how come I've never gotten any error message or warning that this was a potential issue for the past year I've had this and expected it work as promised?""Oh, because we can only see connectivity issues on our side and the end user can't see them."" So apparently I've had a faulty Ring going for over a year and it takes an actual robbery attempt to discover this? If this product is going to be less than 100% reliable and as an end user, I'm not actually going to be aware of when it is not, then it's value as a security camera is nil. I'm also not sure I totally buy this reason, as I have so many other recorded events, including all the ones immediately after and before. This is the only video that I am aware of being missing, of course I haven't really had to track all the times it was just me or my wife leaving the house, or the mail man coming.Anyways, if you can't count on a security camera working perfectly and there's no way to know if it's not working (when it appears to be working), then it's not something I can recommend in good faith. It took an actual attempted robbery to learn this the hard way, hopefully you'll be smart and look for a more secure, fail-proof solution.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2019"

144,Matthew,"Good cam, gets the job done, easy to setup.","  I received this on Saturday, a day earlier than what was showing in tracking (good job Amazon!). My son and I went to work and started setting things up. Having worked with Ring devices before for clients, it was exciting to set one up for my home. It all worked out well, and setup was a breeze.I was thinking this product would support 5ghz wireless, but only 2.4ghz. Not a deal breaker but just shows they're probably working on a 3rd gen one of these things which might support 5ghz. Either way, it works well for me, signal is strong, and the picture is clear. The only thing that was a pain in the butt was setting up the motion zones. After messing with it for 2 days, I ended up foregoing the gutter mount bracket that I bought, and mounted it to the brick. Do yourself a favor and get your own masonry bit as the one they send you is dull as all hell. The reason I mounted it to the brick is because of the height. While it was at the recommended 9 feet, I wasn't capturing what I wanted to on the driveway, and got more alerts for cars going by. Not a big deal, switched it to alert for people only and that quieted down the alerts a bit.It wasn't triggering very well, so I moved it lower so it could capture a wider area. I did this per the Ring instructions and recommendations. However, you'll need to keep one thing in mind about the app. Setting up motion zones is weird, and according to them, they're working on it. The way you do it is by turning the zone ON or OFF, in the app. Then, you click continue, and it gives you a sensitivity bar, but its not really clear what adjusting that bar does in the instructions. Basically what that adjustment bar does in the 2nd step of the motion zone setup, is adjust the distance. Setting it to MAX allows it to sense motions up to 30 feet away. However, there is correlation between how many feet it will detect at, and the position on the adjustment bar. You just have to play around with it until you get it right.... time consuming, and could easily be fixed by a UI update in the app.You apparently could do this before, but they took away the ability to set motion zones precisely in the latest app update. They said its by design, but I think they might ""fix"" it in a future update. Right now I set my camera to MAX or 3/4 of the way to MAX, and it seems to detect what I want to detect.Battery life seems OK, but I've been doing a lot of adjusting over the last couple of days, and I'm at 75%. Once I get everything adjusted, I won't be messing with it as much and I expect the battery to last a few weeks. Either way, I'll be purchasing the solar panel to keep it charged. I did not buy a 2nd battery, nor do I plan to.Overall, good product. Loses one star for no 5ghz support and pain in the butt motion zone setup. Either way you won't be disappointed.Finally, the subscription. People complain about it, but I don't see what the big deal is here. 3$ per device, or 10$ for an entire location, per month. That a fraction of what I paid when I had a system bought from a security company. Sure, it misses some features, and you get what you pay for with a security company (I originally was going to get a CPI security system until I saw Ring). But, if you don't really care about all of that fancy monitoring and just want something you can setup yourself and pay a marginal monthly fee, you won't be disappointed with Ring in my opinion. For us, devices are nice, features are what I'm looking for, and the price fits my budget.I plan on getting a solar panel for the camera as it seems to be chomping through the battery (probably because I keep screwing around with it), the doorbell cam 3, and an 8 piece security system.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2020"
145,Crash and Burn,60%+ Failure Rate of New Battery Cams... but they fixed it FAST! (updated review),"  I had an issue with the second of three camera I bought recently. Upon contacting support, initially I was given the runaround by the technicians with regard to an issue they could clearly see (a failed attempted update of the firmware). Very quickly after I requested additional assistance, I was contacted by Alexis on the Special Customer Support team. Alexis immediately communicated the resolution to me and shipped a replacement, migrated my videos over, and even spotted an accounting error in the cloud service and got me a credit! I was pleasantly surprised and very happy!I was about to replace my Rings but Alexis's special support restored my confidence in Ring and their products. Support is SUCH a critical issue with the level of investment and complexity of these systems... and if this level of support can be offered to the whole system and monitoring... I would actually cancel my ADT and move solely to Ring (60+/mth for basic monitoring from ADT... with no additional value). Ring gives me peace-of-mind and offers daily alerting/auditing of activity, awareness regardless of where I'm at, and true visibility into what is happening at my house (I can see from my phone or iPad).

146,Alan F. Paredes,Working perfectly so far,"  We have a gated patio with a ring doorbell by the front door, but because of the placement we could never get a great view of the gate. Since Amazon and others often leave our packages right inside the gate I wanted to keep an eye on things. Also, since there's often a video delay when my doorbell detects someone, I wanted another shot at seeing who was on my patio. The camera was very easy to pair, set up and install. The field of view settings are less tailorable than the doorbell, but I was able to get it to watch a 180 degree view that extends just the 10 feet to the gate and not to the street another 15 feet away. I didn't want it to set off every time someone walked their dog past. I turned off notifications just in case for now, but enabled the light. This morning I awoke to two notices. My son left early for work and my daughter drove off to school, and those were the only things recorded. No dog walkers or cars, so I'm happy. The only thing I wish Ring would fix is the mount. This camera is mounded around 7 feet off the ground and  I wish I could point it down more. If you plan to mount this up high you may have issues pointing down to your target area unless you shim the mount. Also, the ball mount seems very weak. It doesn't have an internal ridge that makes a satisfying snap when you push the ball in. The camera falls out until you tighten the mounting ring, and even then a little tug pulls the camera out of the mount. It should be tighter.

I got another camera to have a view on my driveway and keep an eye on my vehicles at night.  The biggest problem with the battery version of ring cameras are almost everything.  Not to bash them too much, but:1. I hate the fact that they only record 30 seconds after they capture motion and sometimes dont restart recording when a person is still there.  The video feed just cuts off even though there is still movement!2. Motion recording is only partially started when reviewing why the camera was set off.  Basically you only see a portion of the beginning of the video when reviewing.  You miss the first part of motion unless you download the video to your phone, and even then, you sometimes dont get it.3. Motion zones to preserve battery are less of an actual option with battery.  I set my motion zones to prevent cars from being captured, but it also reduced the sensitivity of capturing people.  I cant adjust it any more or less.  With it being lowered, the motion of a person will be captured right when they are near the camera vs them walking up.  I adjusted it back to more sensitive and now just got used to seeing every car pass by (not a busy street anyway).4. The most annoying thing is that the app notifies you of motion, butnit takes 30 seconds or more for you to actually review the footage and why the app notified you in the first place.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2020"

How can you have an outdoor battery powered camera that cant handle cold temperatures? Ring's recommendation is to bring it inside to warm up and charge. So basically this camera is useless in the winter.Update: Ring customer service reached out and replaced camera with a plug in version which has worked without issue in single digit temps. So A+ for customer service. But still, if you live in a colder climate I'd recommend getting a plug in version or at least a solar panel to keep batteries at max charge.Update: Spotlight cams even with a solar panel to keep batteries fully charged do not handle cold weather well. As temps get much below freezing the cameras die and then can take days to fully recharge off solar. Stick up cams seem to soldier on through much better.

157,AM.Artist,Remote video without any wires!,"  I saw these and was intrigued about having video at the front and back of the house without any wiring, so I ordered two. I was concerned with the battery life. The packaging and instructions were great. I got them set up quickly and installed the software on my wife's phone. I have an older phone that runs Android 4.4 and the software was not compatible with that old of a version, which I cannot criticize. The cameras have worked flawlessly over the past three months and provide us with the peace of mind of knowing who is near our house. One side benefit is that we know when parcels are delivered so we can make sure to fetch them right away. Some of the delivery people don't bother to knock or ring the doorbell, so this keeps packages from sitting on the front porch waiting for a thief.The battery life has been good. The phone app tells you when they need recharging and it's a simple press of the button to open the battery compartment and slide out the battery. I have only charged them once since installing them. There is no indicator telling you when the batteries are fully charged though. I charged them for 3-4 hours, and upon re-installation, ihe app said they were about 50% charged. Next time I will leave them on for about 8 hours.All in all, I am very pleased with these two cameras and the software. They were a little expensive, but for the money, you get quick setup and operation as well as a seamless app. If you want to record the events for later playback, it will cost $30 per camera per year, which is reasonable.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2018"

Each battery lasts almost 3 months which is wonderful !  I can always rely on the camera and flood lights to be working 24/7. My motion sensor only goes on and off when I enter and exit the front door or I pull my car in and out of my garage.  I have set the motion detection not to cover dog walkers on my front sidewalk. My motion detector and videos begin to record when anyone comes close to the front door and/or leaves a package or rings my doorbell. It is quite sensitive so that if you have a garden flag that is flapping in the wind, if it is too close to the area of your cameras vantage point it will set off the notification on your cell phone, thus I have moved my flag further out as not to be in the radius of my cameras motion. I couldn’t be more pleased with this purchase. Mine hangs underneath my front porch thereby not getting hit by direct sunlight, snow, or rain water. In fact most folks cannot even see the camera, so they don’t know they are on it when approaching or standing at my front door.

I no longer had power for the floodlight cam over the driveway so I opted to buy the ring battery cam for the front. I figured the ""camera"" part was almost identical so it should have similar features. I was wrong! The motion detection range is horrible on the battery cam. You cannot draw a motion detection area like you can with the floodlight cam so it doesn't even detect motion within 20 feet even with the sensitivity set on max. The battery life is terrible, even though I don't have the motion light active and the app constantly asks if I want to reduce the motion frequency. NO! Why buy a camera to alert you of motion only to have it try to capture less motion. I am now forced to buy the solar panel since the battery doesn't even keep a charge for 2 weeks and takes 8+ hours to charge back up. I'm beginning to think it would have been cheaper to run a wire, mount a box and put the wired camera up but it is too late to send back.

160,Mike. R,Privacy concern ALERT!! Must read,"  So I have a heartache with Ring, especially after investing in their security cameras... so just recently, I discovered that all ring cams constantly keeps recording regardless of the settings in the ring app. Like, this is a huuuge privacy concern to me filming me all daylong in my underwear and storing on cloud storage and apparently they have access to it. When I contacted Ring, to explain why I’m not able to arm my camera to only record when I’m away, they said as of right now , it’s not possible unless I climb the wall to unplug it every time I’m home??? Like, you’ve got to be kidding me!! Multi billion dollar company and thousands of dollars spent on their products only to not be able to use the camera how I want use it??... if you have no issues with it recording you all day at home and have someone access it when they can, then by all means ; good for you!For me, this is horrible and unacceptable because I only wanted to record on motion detection while I’m away from my house, for obvious reasons. And I should be able to program it that way just like Arlo.On arlo I control when and how a camera should record for me, and to be honest Arlo cams are superior to ring besides the doorbells.Anyways, I escalated my complaint and concern to the highest level on the phone and ended up canceling my cloud monitoring subscription until they add that feature as they promised me they will do. Last thing I need is someone to hack and monitor me all day long, like how in the world they got away with this one?

161,Mike. R,I wish I bought the wired option...,"  Edit 5/13/19I love Ring, have the alarm, sensors, smart locks, 2 door bells and 2 spotlight cams. I bought a 2nd battery model after installing one above my garage door. The one above my garage works very well after it's 2nd battery and solar charger. (I bought a 2nd battery and solar charger for this one as well) The new one I have installed on my fence facing my house and the motion alerts are NON-STOP and rarely have anything in the videos (clouds maybe??) Online help suggested using the human detection and slider function, but that's not available on the battery model.The video quality on the 2nd is not very good compared to the first. Wifi signal is close to the same and it's actually closer to the router...I cannot recommend this battery version due to the non-stop false alerts and lack of options to reduce them. I suggest getting a wired version or a different brand. thanksEdit 3/14/19Ring reached out to me and offered an extra battery and solar charger to address my concerns. The extra battery had helped a lot and I've not yet been able to properly install the solar panel. I'll update the review once I've had a chance to do that. I'm interested in buying a plug in certain or the version with the 2 lights for a different area of my house. I've also added a network extender and relocated this camera to my driveway. So far no issues at all when using the extender.Delay in recording and battery life is so-so.  Yes, I could buy another battery but that's an added cost.  I will probably do that, and am bought into Ring because of the alarm system.  I think there's a good value with the alarm subscription and cameras, but the app can be problematic at times.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2018"

163,Joseph R Pike,"horrible battery life - unsuitable for indoor use, no integration with alarm system, no control!","  I bought these just before the new StickUp camera came out. At that time, the spotlight cam was advertised as being suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. After my experience, I complained to Ring and their customer service agent told me that these cameras are not appropriate for indoor use because you can't control them with either the base alarm system (e.g., turn them on/off depending on whether your security system is armed) or by schedule (e.g., only on at night). In fact, you can't turn them off at all except by removing the battery (or letting it die, as I did). If you want those features, don't buy this product.I bought three of them to cover areas of my house, and installed one. After fully charging the battery (took >7 hours), I gave it a go. Since it was rapidly draining the battery (even without using the lights at all, it was recording video about every 5 minutes through the day and a couple times an hour all night), I put all the settings to as minimal as possible (helped a little with battery life but lost the sensitivity to detect motion in most of the room). It still drained the battery in about 8 days. Even if I used both battery compartments, I'd be dragging in a ladder a couple times a month and having significant downtime for recharging the battery packs. I'm sure this is fine if you want to monitor an area that has zero non-criminal activity, but if you (or your pets, kids, or guests) regularly walk through the field of view, be prepared for the battery to drain super fast and not have any control over settings that would mitigate that. And since there is no integration with the base station, there's absolutely no advantage to sticking with Ring products for this application. I'm trying to decide if there's somewhere I can still use these but I think I will be returning them. I'm really disappointed.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2019"

She called and emailed me back an forth to solve my compain in my reviewed and now she took care of my problem by advising me to get a different Spotlight cam which is from Spotlight battery operated to the plug in Spotlight cam and this plug-in one is very good because it has an option to set for PEOPLE only and it works very good and I never get a false notification no more so I added 3 more stars to the previous one . Thank you Ring customer  ( Alexis ) for helping me right away.Please see 3 pictures from right to left including one picture from my Ringpro cam I can see almost the whole front yard.This old review : I hated the motion detection on Spotlight Cam battery, it doesn’t work good I try to set it to low medium and high and much but it doesn’t detect good not for human only because there is no option to do it. it detected on anything like tree leaf moving or reflecting sun and sound and I’ve live in a very quiet street too . I’ve try to set all kind of the distance but it’s still suck. I had a 4 cars drive way 2 on each side and I’ve set it just to see my cars and the street only I don’t want  see the neighbors in front of me so the camera lens is kind of tilted down a lot and the sensor is tilted back with it too but if I move it up I could see my neighbors house which it’s kind of their privacy. If someone drove in to park behind the first car it won’t detected at all until the driver got out walks  so close to the cam sensor then it will trigger which I don’t like it at all it’s missed a lot of activity . What if a bad person trying  to do bad things with car or the driver and the cam won’t trigger ? I wished they updated to set it for people only or do something to the sensor’s so it can be move to front or back separate it from the body of the camera so we could adjust the sensor to see farther just like the food light that everyone used or at my house . I wanted to return it but it’s over a month already.If compared to my Ring Pro cam it’s the best I ever owned because I have an option to set it to trigger for human only if I don’t wanted to detect anything else and  I never had a faulty notification when a human walking in front of my door’s cam .

165,catherine miller,"Great cam, simple to install, robust app","  The motion detection on thses cams is very good and highly customizable.  The night vision is much better than expected.  The field of view is tremendous, only a little fish eye distortion in the very outer fringes.  Clarity is good, wish the resolution was greater so one could read license plates  when zooming in.  The WiFi connection could use improvement.  I had to purchase 2 WiFi extenders to get 2 cams I have in trees close to my house to connect, one of which is in my daughter's bedroom window ~25 feet away and the best the Cam will register is a RSSI of 68 and the other which is further away registers a RSSI of 57 - go figure. That being said, capturing ""live"" movement once a notification can be challenging as it takes several seconds to connect especially during the day with full color (more data, response time is much better on night vision.)I have a wired Floodlight camera too and the video quality is indistinguishable from the three battery cams.The battery life is quite good, once you configure your unit not to capture every squirrel sneeze - I had no idea my front stoop was a squirrel playground until I installed one of these cams.I don't have any experience with all the other cams on the market but i have been in high tech for ~35 years and have to say that the Ring app and UI are both friendly and robust, there really hasn't been a time where I've said to myself ""I wish I could ...""",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2019"
166,Bones,Abysmal product coming from a Ring security system owner,  Let me first start off by saying I have the ring security system and an indoor wired ring camera and have been really happy with both of those products. The outdoor spotlight battery camera however is quite a different story. This product continuously drops from my Wi-Fi system (running gigabit service on an Orbi an WiFi mesh network with strong signal) having me to go outside get the ladder and restart the camera and reconnect it to my Wi-Fi.  When it is connected to my Wi-Fi it takes forever to connect or doesn’t connect at all as you can see in the photos that I’ve provided. I really wanted to like this camera however it is just more trouble than it is worth. I also have the solar panel connected to it which is a nice touch but I will be returning both of these items and go with the Arlo flood light camera.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 11, 2021"
167,#2,Fair hardware - Very poor software,"  My review, after about 3 weeks of use, covers the Ring Spotlight Camera (battery) (I purchased three) and a Ring Chime. I also purchased three, non-Ring, solar panels that I don’t review here. First thing after reading the instructions was to charge the batteries using the USB computer connection. It took about 10 hours per battery to get the indication for a fully charged battery.Next I went online to download the Android software. First, let me say, the Amazon ratings for the cameras were quite good, which led me to make the purchase. I was disappointed to see the Ring software rating to be 3 stars.I checked the MS Windows app. Which was 2.5 stars, and finally the iPad app, which was rated 3 stars. Not really impressive.Mostly thin plastic, the overall construction appears cheap. The battery cover door and latch seem quite fragile and there are no rubber seals. I question the weatherproofing and long-term durability.I first tried the initial set-up using an iPad, it failed with about six attempts. Set-up with Android went rather smoothly (I have no idea why the iPad failed).Mounting: Make sure to review all the entire instructions before starting. There are a couple of things you might miss to make your life easier (e.g., double ended screwdriver, or the reversible mounting plate).All three of my cameras are mounted under the eaves, but, one unit, I’ve moved multiple times, on the same wall, due to the night vision being extremely “washed out”, whereas the image appears as if it were in a dense fog. After some experimentation I found that the issue seems to be from heat being retained into the evening by the wall and being detected by the infrared sensors. I finally moved the camera down lower, where there is less effect from that heat.Back to the software (where most of the issues arise). After everything was physically mounted, I went to the software. The downloaded Owner’s Manual provides very little detail and does not fully match what you’re seeing on the actual app. Getting around in the app was not intuitive at all, went to many a dead-end trying to find my way.  Worse, the online HELP.  Instead of having product specific help, they combine instructions for multiple products on the same page, making things quite confusing at times. Like the Owner’s Manual, often the names of functions are different than what I’m actually seeing on the app.I have an ongoing issue with my primary device, an Android phone. It is not uncommon at all for this device to NOT receive a Motion Alert. For some, yet to be determined, reason the setting keep changing (apparently on their own). Multiple times a day I have to go in and reactivate my motion alerts. Other times, the setting appear fine but it does not receive any alerts.I remounted all of my cameras multiple times in order to cut down on false alerts. After some time, I’ve two cameras giving only minimal false alerts. One last camera, mounted at about 8’ high, is alerting on vehicles, abut 80-100’ away, on the opposite side of a 6’ solid brick wall, the camera can only see the top of those vehicles. I’m still trying different setting with the two Motion Zone adjustments.Motion Schedule: The problem with this setting is that there is nothing to indicate if your settings are activating or deactivating the alerts (i.e., should I select 8:00 a.m. does it stop or start at that time?) The online instructions read, “Set the start and end times”, no help there.  I was able to activate the Motion Schedule but when I can’t get a Schedule to turn off, via the designated “button”; the only way I’ve been able to deactivate a schedule is to actually DELETE it.On the Android, shutting off “Vibrate” also shuts off the sound alertsAfter days of use I discovered many more issues with the software which is too much to go into here. Basically, the software needs considerable improvements to be worthy of the current cost.About a week after setting up my cameras I received an unsolicited email from Ring titled “Optimizing Your Motion Alerts”, these instructions covered three of their products BUT NOT THE ONE I OWN.Overall, the cameras provide good video, day and night. The cameras are of flimsy construction. The mounting hardware not very versatile but usable. The major weakness is in the heart of the system, the software and software manual. Too many false notifications, like Pablov’s dog, encourages you to ignore most of the notifications… which defeats the primary reason for having the system. The other significant issue, is with my Android phone that needs the software “reset”, currently on a daily basis, where as it stops providing Motion Alerts. Does this system make me feel my home is secure? Not really. This being my fist video security system I have nothing to compare it to, but for what I paid, I don’t feel I got my money’s worth.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2019"
168,#2,Great Device and Great Customer Support,"  UPDATE:  Ring reached out to me and worked very hard to make sure we could get this camera running as it should and I'm very happy with its performance now.  The range of motion detection isn't quite as good as I'd like but in every other way this is a solid product.  I do strongly recommend you get the solar panel to go along with it if you purchase this, not only did it improve performance, it eliminates the need to ever have to take out and charge the battery.UPDATE:  I bought the add-on solar panel and performance improved significantly.  Seems odd but it is the case, it has not disconnected from the network even once since being on the solar panel and it is more responsive.When it works, it's great.  But a few times a week it will stop working - no live view, no motion detection.  The only solution I've been able to find to this is to remove the battery and put it back in.  Nothing else I've tried from the Ring troubleshooting or the internet in general seems to resolve this.  The app says the WiFi strength is great.  So, for $200, I'm very disappointed.  The $30 Wyze cam I bought for the inside performs far better.  Gotta go get the ladder and remove the battery now (again).",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2020"
169,Tony Inderbitzin,LIVE VIEW only worked 30% of the time on either camera. Camera 'missed' events several times.,"  Summary:Pros:1) setup was simpleCons:1) Cannot adjust motion areas on battery cameras effectively. This causes every gust of wind that moves the bushes to set off the alarm. What a poor design. This is basic. You can adjust it a little - but you can't blank out areas / draw areas.2) Live viewing the cameras fails well over 50% of the time. What good is a security camera if I can't look out it? Ring Support suggested I place the cameras within 15 feet of my router - despite claiming they work fine up to 30 feet. I couldn't get the live view to work consistently when placed 5 feet away.3) Compared to my friends Nest and another friends Arlo - the video quality is subpar. It is 'decent' when superclose - but, any distance away and you can't even read licenses plates. I expect better for 1080p.4) I am getting alerts (sometimes 10 alerts in a row) and when the live preview fails - I go to look at what it recorded and low and behold... nothing.5) Someone visited my house, knocked on my door, walked away and the video didn't capture the event until they were almost out of view some 40 feet away from the camera. Great security system.6) The 'preview' of the cameras for Nest and Arlo show all camera live from 1 window. RING preview only shows a still image that was recently captured. Often when I looked it would be from the day before which makes the preview completely pointless.. besides the fact that the views are not showing live motion. Besides Live view not working correctly - this was my second biggest issues. I want to see all cameras LIVE from 1 window. I only need to zoom in to 1 camera if there is something there I need to see in better detail.I would not recommend ring. Their products are rushed. The housing to the cameras feels cheap and the biggest issue: they don't work correctly. I bought a wireless mesh system to extend wireless signal for this system. I had a good connection to my router (rssi under 50) and still could not get this product working like it is supposed to.Details:I purchased two spotlight cams, door bell cam, and the 8piece RING security system. The spotlight cams were installed easily but, I could only see a live view 30% of the time I tried. I called RING support and they said the camera ideally needs to be 15ft from the router. Even with the camera 5 ft from the router for troubleshooting purposes - we couldn't get it to work. I was asked to connect the device to a second network. I only have 1 internet connection.. like 99% of consumers. Also - a different device was working (albeit only when 5 ft from the router). So - my network wasn't the issue (I am network engineer for a major US telecom - I bought a robust wireless system to work with this).Ring support did 'try' to help me.  But, ultimately they were not able to think of anything I didn't already try and then had to stop troubleshooting because they wanted me to pointlessly connect to a different internet connection to test it.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2019"

Even with the solar panel keeping the battery charged, the battery simply ceases to operate in the cold.  I think it quit when it got below zero F.  The website says to bring it inside.  That's not going to happen.  They say it will begin operating again when it gets warmer.  That's two months from now if we're lucky.

173,Eric,Dissapointed.,"  Loved the idea of a spotlight combined with a motion camera.  I set this up to watch my cars in my driveway.  I've had 2 car break ins in the last year.  My hope was to scare the crook away with the light popping on, before they broke into my car.  Unfortunately, it was a failure.  No matter the zone and sensitivity settings, it was very poor at detecting people.  I'd approach the cam straight on from the edge of my driveway, which was about 25.5' away for testing.  I would be 6-10' away, in front of the cam, with my arms raised above my head, waiving them about, and it would not detect me even 50% of the time.  It was great at catching cars driving by.  After messing with the settings for over 2 weeks, and seeing no improvement, I called their help line.  I was on the phone for 45 minutes with them.  They were attentive and did try to help my adjust the settings, or aim the camera up or down, but nothing improved it.  I was told that the height I had it at was fine, so that was not the issue.  I was told that a specialist would call me the next night at a time I designated.  No one called the next night.  At that point I returned it.  Ring was easy to work with, and accepted the return (it was just a day under the 30 day return window).  The battery life was OK.  Not great.  The battery lasted about 2-3 weeks before needing a recharge.  The shorter battery life than expected could have been due to me changing the settings repeatedly every other day or so.  The wifi was OK.  It claimed it was a weak signal, but rarely disconnected.  I tested the same location with my phone and average about 25 Mb/s.  It's too bad, as I had high hopes for this cam.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2019"

They are great however they go ""off line"" a lot which is super annoying.  The Ring cameras we have are more reliable in that arena.  This light is easy to install.  I definitely recommend getting a second battery even though they last a very long time.  You can put them anywhere your WiFi signal can reach even is there is no outlet nearby which is helpful.  The feature I wish Ring has that the other brand has is continuous recording.  Sometimes I want to review something which didn't cause an alert but I can't.  You can only review video of activities which the camera alerted to.

180,QuirkyJules,"Poor instructions, complicated set-up, too many issues - WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!","  I had high hopes for this camera.  We have Wyze cams which we are extremely happy with that we use indoors as doggie cams, but we needed one to monitor the outside of our home.  As Wyze does not yet make a cam for outdoor use, we choose to go with the Ring Spotlight Cam, purchasing the separate solar panel so that we don't have to bother with constantly charging the battery.  BIG MISTAKE!  Unlike the Wyze which takes less than 2-minutes to set up, the instructions for the Ring Spotlight camera set-up are complicated, confusing and inadequate, especially when trying to combine the cam with the solar panel set-up.  One of the steps needed to set up the camera is to slide off a back panel and reverse it for some reason - a step NOT covered in the instructions.  I wound up having to call their customer service department.  A half hour later, I got someone overseas who was working off of a script - which is maddening.  When I was finally able to get her to understand my difficulties, she kept having to put me on hold for each step to consult with someone else.  Another half hour later, she finally gave up and transferred me to someone in the States.  This customer service rep was very professional and tried to assist me, however after we succeeded in setting up the camera, he was unable to get the motion alerts feature to work properly  meaning that while the live cam worked fine, the camera was not sending me any alerts when it detected motion.  After yet another half hour, he said that they would send me a replacement camera.  He said they would include a label for me to send the problematic camera back.  My bad that I forgot to ask a timeframe or tracking info or whether or not they were going to send me packaging for the return cam nor where I was going to have to bring it.  I sent an email to Ring customer support asking all of those questions and kept getting annoying, irrelevant boilerplate responses back, all ending by telling me ""we treat our customers like neighbors and genuinely care..."".  Sounds real nice, but given that I am now 7 email exchanges in with customer service trying to get answers to my questions, I wouldn't want to be a  Ring neighbor and I don't think they care very much.  I definitely do NOT recommend this particular camera and if someone at Ring is bothering to read this - you really need to improve both your set-up instructions AND your customer support.  STOP with the annoying boiler plate responses and tell your customer support people to actually take two minutes to read and respond to the email that is sent!UPDATE AUGUST 13TH:  Okay - I have to update my initial one-star review detailing my horrendous experience trying to get this camera working and my subsequent frustration with customer service both on the phone and in endless email exchanges which were not addressing my outstanding issues and questions.  Today I had a call with Alexis from Ring whose title I believe is ""Amazon Executive Community Support Representative.""  Alexis made up for most of what I had gone through with Ring customer service to date.  She was everything you could hope for in a customer service rep.  1) She is located in the USA, speaks fluent English and was definitely not working off of some boiler plate script.  Please don't call me xenophobic - dealing with overseas call centers can be - and was for me - absolutely maddening and unproductive.  Dealing with someone in the USA who was capable of thinking outside of a prescribed box was, by comparison, a pleasure.  2) Alexis had researched and was aware of my previous experiences with customer service and was extremely apologetic and sympathetic - much appreciated.  3)  She listened carefully to what had gone wrong with the first Ring cam I was sent and patiently walked me through setting up the replacement cam - step-by-step, carefully explaining everything we were doing and how everything works as well as patiently answering all of my many questions.  Had I dealt with Alexis or someone as professional and helpful as she is from the beginning, I would have fewer gray hairs and lower blood pressure.  I have upgraded my rating from one star to two in recognition of my positive experience with Alexis, but I cannot give this product 5 stars due to the problems I had with the first cam, my subsequent experiences with customer service, and the problems I continue to have with the replacement cam.UPDATE ON SEPT 5, 2019:  So the problems with this camera don't seem to end.  First, the reception was poor and the camera was not picking up motion or sending alerts.  Alexis in Customer Service I told me to re-locate the cam, which I did.  The problem persisted.  Still dealing with Customer service rep Alexis (I can no longer count how many phone calls and emails back-and-forth), she ultimately wound up sending me a Chime Pro booster to boost the signal from my router to the cam, which was very nice of her - but why should that even have been necessary to make this cam function properly?  I had to relocate the Chime Pro four times before finding an outlet that actually helped boost the poor signal the cam was getting.  Again - bear in mind we have two Wyze cams, much further from the router and on a different floor that have NO problem with the signal.  With the Chime Pro, the cam was picking up a better signal from the router, but still missing  a good amount of the action in front of it and missing sending alerts for that action.  Not much more customer service could do or recommend to resolve that issue.Today, I looked for a way to record live action on the cam and found there is none.  You'd think that a security camera would have a simple button on the live action screen that you could push to immediately record the action taking place - not the Ring Cam.  I contacted Alexis once again asking her how I could accomplish this.  In her first response, Alexis wrote back ""Once the live video finishes (or you click the red phone icon to end it yourself) you can share the event through event history in the Ring App. There are icons in the bottom right corner that allow you to download (to your mobile device), email, share directly to neighbors, text message, etc. the video file to whomever you'd like (or yourself).""I responded that this is not what I asked, needed or wanted.  I was looking for a way to record live action as it was occurring, not a way to share one of the brief ""motion alerts"" that the cam periodically sends and saves.  Alexis then wrote back:  ""Yes, Apple allows screen recording: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207935.""  Wonderful.  So the answer to the question is that the Ring Cam has NO way to easily record live action.  BIG design flaw!  So consider this scenario: your car is being broken into in the driveway and - if you're lucky - the cam will pick up the action and send you a motion alert.  You turn on the live cam and see the perpetrator breaking into your car.  You want to record the video to capture what is happening so that you can provide it to law enforcement.  No  way to do that with the Ring cam.  You have to follow some convoluted instructions to go through your cel phone's settings.  I actually tried to do this and even that didn't work at recording the live action on the cam screen.BOTTOM LINE:  First I was sent a defective camera which, after hours on the phone, was ultimately replaced (I had to schlep the defective cam to UPS to return it).  Set-up on the new cam was not ""plug and play"" as it is for Wyze cams.  Set-up was difficult and complicated.  Reception was poor and I had to uninstall and reinstall the camera in a different location to try to improve the signal.  Signal still poor, Alexis - in Ring Customer Service who - as I have said a number of times - was very nice and really tried to resolve all these issues - sent me a Chime Pro signal booster.  After much moving around, finally found a place where the Chime Pro did succeed in boosting the signal from the router to the cam.  The cam continues to miss much of the motion going on in front of it and I only get some of the motion alerts but it is definitely better than before, for what that's worth.Wanting to record live action, I discovered the cam has no feature to do this - that I have to follow some convoluted process through my iPhone.As hard as Alexis has tried to assist me - there are way too many issues with this Ring cam and it has occupied way too much of my time attempting to resolve them.I would not only NOT recommend this Ring cam - I would say avoid it at all costs and seek alternatives.My Wyze cams are much easier in every way and do a much better job and if they had one suitable for outdoor use, I would buy it in a heartbeat.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2019"
181,Brandon yen,the light doesn't work well,"  I have this up over my garage, at the exact height recommended. The motion-activated lights feature was especially important to me--I want the light to go on at night whenever a person is lurking around the garage entrance. Unfortunately, this feature is defective. At night, the light comes on when motion is detected. But after 5-10 seconds, the light just goes out -- even if there is still motion occurring! So for instance, if I walk circles directly in front of my garage at night, the light will go on for a few seconds, and then promptly turn off -- even if I am still moving and in direct view of the camera. (I have the ""Turn Lights on with Motion"" feature activated in the device settings, so it's not that.) I hope someone at Ring can reach out to me to fix this problem. It's very disappointing.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2020"
182,Brandon yen,Not worth it,"  After 1.5 years of ownership, I do not recommend Ring products. They only capture on motion detection and are so slow to connect to wifi even with a router just inside that they often miss everything. Motion zones are not good - triggered by leaves blowing or cars in the street unless you turn off all motion and then what is the point. The app itself is ok, but unless you post a video of someone committing a crime it will get blocked. Drug activity, aggressive people just out of camera view, etc. will not get shared. As a plus, installation is easy, the solar panel works well, and the camera itself is a kind of deterrent.

Otherwise you must manually reset, which requires physically touching the unit.  Totally useless for home security if your away from home.  And as these are mounted high, even if I am home it requires getting up on a ladder.  I have invested quit a bit in ring for two homes.

186,Bob,"Great camera, but app  software needs improvement","  Very nice camera—easy to install, very good image in HD, but needs a strong WiFi signal to connect.  I added the solar panel and the battery never goes below 80%.I had to add an access point in my house, even though I had a Ring Chime/repeater 25 feet away.Some software issues (iPhone app):1.  I also have a Ring Pro doorbell (purchased first).  That has a very flexible motion zone (i.e., the area where motion will activate the chime).  You can creat a custom area to monitor.  Unfortunately, the ability to adjust the motion zone for the camera is very restricted. Basically, you can select from left-center-right thirds (1, 2 or all 3) and distance (near to far).  Our camera faces down our driveway, and every time the wind blows through our rose bushes, the chime goes off.  The doorbell has a motion sensitivity option and the ability to exclude the bushes.  The camera (in the app) does not have these options.2.  When installing the camera, the app asks you to name the location from some presets (e.g., “Garage”).  However, when set off, the announcement just says “Motion at Spotlight Camera”.  I don’t know how you would differentiate if you had two or more.  Since I had to select a name, I would like the notification to say “Motion at Garage Spotlight Camera.”3.  When there is motion, I’m notified almost instantly.  However, if I want to see what’s happening, I have to open the Ring app, select the camera, then tap “Live” and wait 5-10 seconds to see the image. Usually, the delivery person or whoever is gone by the time the camera is activated in live mode. (However, a 30 second replay is available in a few minutes.)So, great camera with app software and responsiveness to a request for “live” video that needs improvement. (If you are listening, Ring, you can start queuing “live” video as soon as the motion detector goes off.)",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2019"
187,Christopher Dent,Does not meet expectations at all.,"  This product is relatively straightforward to install and the experience of initial setup is pretty well done. This earned them 1 star. The video is very clear, the night vision is as well, and the light + siren is a nice feature. Star #2.This is unfortunately where the benefits end for me. This product requires an active subscription for some of the most important features to stay available to you; saving recordings of motion events. Now, the do mention the protection plans on this product page, however I feel that the text is the bare minimum. They do not mention to you that you will not be able to access or save any records, regardless of being 30 days old or 30 seconds old. Honestly, I expected better but in the word of MRR/ARR it doesn't surprise me that this company has found a way to charge us a recurring charge. $10 per month for a household or $3 for device is not steep but it was unexpected because it is NOT EXPLICITLY STATED that you cannot save recordings without it. I have the ability to store the data and would be happy to set that up but there's no way to DIY. You either pay for their service or you get nothing.Additionally, it's a pain in the rear to get signed up for this service. The only way to do it is to select to do so via the prompts you get after you enjoy a 30 day trial. You can't get it to go through any other means that I have found.My biggest complaint however is the seemingly random issues that are encountered with streaming live. The camera sits outside mounted 6 feet from an exterior wall. On the other side of that exterior wall is a router that I can only describe as complete overkill. I bought an insanely fast router with large signal range (3200 Sq Ft. on the 2.4 ghz band) and I still encounter the ""STREAMING ERROR"" notification 90% of the time I try to access the camera. Funnily enough this started only AFTER my 30 day trial to their service ended. Hm.I have found a way to make this camera useful without their support service via the If This Then That application. You can link the camera to your HUE lights so when it detects motion from 10p - 7a I have set it to turn on lights in various locations around the house. That's pretty cool, but this is not a feature Ring has created, it's a feature someone created on IFTTT.Disappointed in this purchase, will eventually be upgrading away from this device and manufacturer into one that allows me to handle the storage better and doesn't have unending STREAMING ERRORs.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2020"
188,PurchaserOfThings,Ring Customer Service is a Joke ** STILL UNRESOLVED,"  I ordered a spotlight camera in December 2019.  Installed easy, and it was decent at picking up movement, except it wouldn't pick up cars pulling in the driveway 20 feet away.  It never activated until I opened my door to get out even at the highest sensitivity.  Weird.  Anyway, it lasted for four months before it failed spectacularly.  The battery died, and when I replaced the battery, I could never get it back on my wifi.  I wouldn't even recognize the battery had been charged.  So I called Ring and was on with support for an hour and a half, doing all the things I'd already done 100 times, before they declared it was defective.  Promised me a new device, said they'd charge my bank $1 until I returned the defective one, blah blah blah.  Okay, great.  Then I wait.  Three weeks later, no email, no new camera.  Call them again.  Full of apologies, of course they're sending the device right out.  Sent a flurry of follow up emails about my replacement, and then.... nothing.  Three weeks pass.  Contact Ring AGAIN, same song and dance, we're sending the replacement, blah blah blah.  No. They. Weren't.  My camera failed in April.  I still do not have a replacement because guess what?  Now they are out of stock, no clue when they'll get more.  Could be months.  Really, Ring?  Think you could've emailed me or something?  Or even better, maybe they could've just sent the replacement when all this started?  I'm just done with these clowns.  If you buy this camera, may the force be with you, because mine lasted four months before it failed, and Ring has demonstrated that they do not care one lick about their customers.Update:  It's like magic.  Ring didn't give two hoots about my issue until I posted this review.  It's a shame that this is what it took for them to care about a customer.  I have a call scheduled with them on Monday.  Frankly, I don't even need to talk to them, I just need a tracking number proving that they've shipped the promised replacement.  We shall see if they really do stand behind their products on Monday.  I'll keep ya posted!Update 2:  So, Ring FINALLY sent me a new camera.  But it doesn't matter.  The new one won't connect either.  It simply does not see my wifi.

190,Stephen Sanchez ,How To Turn A 5-Star Device Into A 3-Star Device,"  HOW, you wonder is that done? By scrimping big-time on the battery. First and foremost, there is no battery charger in the box, only a cable to attach the battery to a charger. All the little manual in the box says is: “First fully charge the battery by plugging it into a power source using the provided orange cable. “  On the Ring website, it says; ”Your Spotlight Cam battery is charged using a common micro-USB cable (an orange one is included in your Ring box). The micro-USB cable can be plugged into any USB power source such as a computer. Your battery will take around five to 10 hours to fully charge depending on whether the USB cable is plugged into a USB port or into a wall outlet.”  So, if you don’t just happen to have a charging cube that takes a removable USB cable, you’ll have to charge it through your laptop. Good luck with that because it took me more than 8 hours to charge the battery when I plugged it into a wall outlet with a charger I happened to have—I started around 3 p.m., and it was still charging when I went to bed at 11 p.m. but ready in the morning. That’s the second big-time battery scrimp by Ring. I was really glad I had invested in a second battery, because who wants to have a security camera that goes offline for 5-10 hours every time the battery needs charging?! All this nonsense really put me in a bad frame of mind before I ever saw what the device can actually do. It took 2 stars off this review because the device itself is excellent. I have come back to add this info re the battery: I put in a fully charged battery at 3 p.m. on June 10; at 3 p.m. on June 12, that battery in down to 85%, so it appears that I will be changing the battery about once every 2 weeks.The camera itself is terrific. It provides a crystal-clear color image during the day and a very respectable B&W image at night without any additional light. But if someone is at your door, the spotlight will have activated in response to the motion (says the Ring manual—no one has yet come to my door at night for me to observe this function; I have just looked at the picture at night in the app). I did not enable the HDR video setting that improves video clarity in the daytime because it’s already very clear and the manual says enabling HDR decreases battery life. Talking to someone at the door is automatic—just start speaking. If you have an Echo Show, you can set up the camera to also work with Alexa. I named the camera device FRONT, so all I have to do is say, “Alexa, show me FRONT.” And you can talk to the visitor via the Echo device rather than via your phone: ""Alexa, answer FRONT."" Its motion sensitivity is almost too good. The camera is at my front door, aimed at the covered porch area, which is a good 25 feet back from the street. I have set the Motion Zone to the minimum allowed, but I still get a motion chirp on my phone anytime a car goes by quickly (slower cars don’t register anymore now that the Zone is minimized). But all large trucks that drive up get a chirp—UPS truck, trash truck, recycling truck, etc. I plan to get a tall friend to help me refine the aim of the camera slightly lower to try and omit seeing cars. But I feel sure that, as long as I have a working battery in place, nothing is going to sneak up on my house from the front! And I might have to put a bag over the camera when the lawn-mowing crew shows up to keep from getting endless chirps on my phone.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2019"
191,barkingcows,A Upgrade over the original Stick Up Cam,"  I will admit that I have become obsessed with Ring Cameras. In total, I have five around my property and, for the most part, I like the video quality and how well each one works.I purchased the Spotlight Cam Battery HD to upgrade an older Ring Stick Up Cam that I have placed in my yard. The cam is about 50' from my wifi router and always gets a good signal.I didn't add the solar panel option, thinking that I could reuse the one off my stick up Cam: you can't. These have proprietary connection, which is frustrating but when I realized that I could add 2 batteries to the cam, I'm not sure I have a need for the solar panel.The biggest difference between the two is the image quality and field of vision. The Spotlight Cam and Stick Up Cam were mounted in the same place but the field of vision is much greater with the Spotlight Cam and the quality of the image is one that's high enough to make out who is walking in the yard.Night time images are equivalent. I haven't used it much at night but the spotlight is bright.I also have a floodlight cam and while the cameras appear similar on the outside, the quality of the image and the motion detection feature is superior.The only feature I wish Ring would add is a small Micro SD slot to record video locally. It seems that if someone wanted to evade detection, they would only need to cut the internet cable first.

We purchased a 2nd battery at a local store ( Amazon on back order) for the spotlight cam as it has 2 battery compartments becoming a back up and additional way to ensure "" coverage"" while charging one battery as need be.Sound and vocal use by using the readily accessible common android cell phone ""hang up"" and ""answer"" buttons along with a microphone button make audible use a breeze.

We had someone hit our mailboxes and steal a prop off our boat so this was much needed and with the installation of a new pool we really needed some increased security. I’ll update if things change but so far I’m impressed. I have the doorbell, floodlight and several spotlight cameras / some wired others with solar panels.

I get about 5 false positives per hour during the day (day meaning 7:30am to 6:00pm). I have to snooze the camera otherwise it kills my phone battery and the camera battery ** the motion sensitivity on the app is misleading but once speaking with Ring, I was able to adjust this and it fixed most of my issue **CONS:- Bad mount design (does not allow for a lot of angles to position the camera and can easily be popped off when adjusting even when tightened correctly) ** they do offer third part mounts on Amazon's site **- Not a lot of options for adjusting motion detection **this was due to being battery powered whereas the hard wired cameras have more options **- App is slow to load camera footage and tends to have lots of errors (then again, this could be an app issue rather than the camera issue because the Ring app sucks)WISH LIST:- More options for motion detection settings- A smarter software for detecting plant movement vs human movement (most false positives are from plants about 50+ feet away moving)SUMMARY:Great camera quality, horrible motion detection (MD) design and settings. I own two and am contemplating a third but may hold off for another year or so until they get better MD software. I'd recommend for anyone who won't get paranoid by the amount of notifications that they will get from plants that are barely outside of the camera's view moving.** Again, Ring's customer service was absolutely amazing and was able to help me.

198,Adam R.,Room For Improvement,"  When I see a review with three stars I tend to fail it in my mind and I probably shouldn't because this product definitely serves its purpose.  But as the headline says, it could be better in some areas, here are the strengths and weaknesses.1.  The motion detection is mostly reliable.  Out of 20 or 30 package deliveries, it only failed to alert once.  However, the unit must put itself to sleep after a long period of inactivity because there is a very long delay between the actual motion and the alert on the app for the first incident.  Subsequent motions however are VERY fast to alert the app.  No matter what though, when you get an alert and tap on Live View, unless the people are hanging around your camera location, you will never catch the delivery person; they'll be gone by the time you're connected and viewing.2.  That brings me to the Event History section on the app.  This is very good and starts recording very quickly.  So when you go back and access this you should be able to catch everything that happened.  It takes a few minutes for that to upload to the server and available for you to watch though, not a big deal.3.  Video Quality:  On your phone it looks great.  But if you ever choose to watch it on a full size computer screen, it's obvious the video is heavily compressed which gives it a grainy, soft focus appearance.  I'm picky about things and wish this was better.  I'm not sure it's even as good as my daughter's dash cam video I've viewed. But again, it's just fine on your phone.4.  Audio Quality:  Frankly not very good.  It has a noise cancellation circuit which I think causes more problems than it solves.  The audio is very noisy.  Anyone remember trying to listen to AM radio back in the 1960s or 70s?  Plus the volume is constantly pumping up and down hunting for the right level depending on what it thinks it is detecting outside.But the worst part is - and maybe my aging Samsung Galaxy S6 is partially to blame - when trying to have a conversation with a person outside, (follow me here) as the person's voice comes through my phone's speaker, their voice then re-enters my phone's mic and plays it back outside through the camera (as if I'm the one talking) and then mutes the person outside - thus - cutting them off after the first three words and making it impossible to hear what they're saying.  Frustrating! 5.  What I really like about it is the wireless (battery operated) unit.  No house-wiring required.  I can't comment on the battery life however because I bought the solar panel to keep it charged and it works GREAT!  I know this isn't a review on the solar panel, but can't recommend this combination enough, very well executed.And the wireless network connectivity works flawlessly as well with (only) the 2.4 Ghz option available.Bottom line is, there are very few units in the market that do what this does without hassling with house wiring and for that reason, I would definitely buy this camera unit again.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2019"

   I love my Ring security cameras.  I was having a problem and was really concerned that it would be fixed.  Jason, tech support with Ring contacted me.  Said he'd be calling me at 5:30 to help me, exactly at 5:30 he called.  That in itself amazed me, no one has ever called me right on time.  He got my cameras up and running quickly and now I have confidence that there's someone to help if there's a problem.  I highly recommend these.  I LOVE MINE.

200,Hanging in there,Does not work in cold weather,"  WINTER UPDATE: I have downgraded this device from five stars to one stars. The batteries do not work when it is below 32F. They won't charge and won't power up the camera when it's that cold. That is because it's a Lithium batteries, and most Li batteries work this way. But this is a problem for me, I am in Minnesota. This camera worked great in the summer and hasn't worked since November. And since I bought it in May, it's too late to return it. Now I have a fancy brick sitting on my garage door.If you live in a cold climate, get the hardwired cam!! I wish I had known this before I bought it!Original Review:We set this camera by my detached garage. Unfortunately it was far enough from our home router that it didn't get much signal. The camera would connect to the app but it wouldn't work - any motion caputred videos were plain black. I then ordered TP-Link AC1200 Wireless MU-MIMO Gigabit Indoor/Outdoor Access Point (EAP225-Outdoor). I ran an Ethernet cable from my router, out my basement window and to the TP Link Access point. I mounted the access point on the outside of my house that faces the garage to create a strong outdoor wifi signal. Only after that the camera worked, and it worked really well! Within one day of use, the camera already caught some action. Some kids used my driveway to turn around on their scooter. And at night, we caught a cat checking out our car. I am so happy I finally have eyes on that side of my house!",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2019"
201,Seth,Problems after 3 years of use,"  Had this set up for security in the backyard of our home. The night vision and video quality was good. A single battery would last 4 to 6 weeks. The stray cats in our neighborhood were responsible for the average 5 alerts per day.In use for 3 years. The rubber seal on the battery door is damaged and can not be repaired. The camera sends a ""battery door open"" alert all the time even though the door is snapped closed tight.  The camera just took a fully charged battery down to 30% in 5 days. This same battery lasted 3 weeks in my doorbell (I rotate 4 batteries).I won't buy another spotlight camera. The battery door seems to be an issue.

202,go_rocks,Sturdy and reliable cameras,"  Overall this is a nice camera to have. It syncs with all of my other Ring products like the doorbell and alarm system. The camera itself is sturdy and good quality. Night vision works very well and you can activate the light on your device to make the picture more clear. I bought 2 of these cameras and spent the extra money for 2 batteries in each. The cameras only come with 1, but if you don’t want to change the batteries as often just buy a spare. These have been active on my home for about a month now and I have about 75% battery life left until they will need charging. I like how the cameras only drain 1 battery at a time so you can just charge the 1 while your device remains active. The negatives are the price of the camera, the motion sensors, and the WiFi connection depending on where you place them. The camera in the front of my home was too far from my WiFi router and I had to purchase a Ring Chime Pro ($50) for it to work. The motion sensors pick up a lot of unnecessary things such as cars driving by and bugs flying. I adjusted my motion sensors to the closest setting possible and I still receive about 50+ notifications every day. Lastly the price of these is pretty steep. I bought my cameras on Prime Day so it wasn’t too bad. If you have other Ring products and want to just use 1 app I would recommend these. There is a yearly fee ($100 if you pay up front) to be able to save your videos and have a live look whenever you want. It’s not a bad deal considering what you’re getting.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 28, 2019"
203,GoldenMomma,Stopped working within 3 months after installation,"  Bought 2 of these cameras for our home. One of the two quit working after 3 months and despite repeated attempts to get it back on line when weather was cooperative enough to safely climb a ladder, it refuses to work. Call to RING was redundant. They insisted I go thru the steps we have done several times and of course the light did not even light. Making it worse is my son pulled it from it's mount and I have it now at a different location expecting to ship it for a replacement. The charging cord for the fully charged batteries that son confirmed yesterday is back at other house in case working camera's solar panels fail. RING is insisting I connect it to the charger as the next step. Will not replace it until I do so.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT.

204,TheGuilty1,Some really annoying flaws,"  Bought this to put on our garage, which is closer to the street and has a better field of view, to supplement our ring doorbell. Setup was easy and I got the solar panel so I don't have to worry about the battery. You definitely have to get the settings dialed in otherwise your phone will never stop giving you notifications. The most annoying thing about this camera is the Wi-Fi connection. I went out and got a range extender to try to solve that problem and it was no help at all. It has a green signal and is only the length of the garage away from the camera. There is always a delay when trying to view live. I do like the snap shot notification feature so you can see what actually triggered the camera.

205,TheGuilty1,Good security cameras,"  I have theses around my house and they do the job for well.

Since I've had them I recorded two times that some tired to get into one of our cars and yelled at them over the speaker, which was enough to scare them off. If you have them set to record every time something moves it well drain the battery pretty fast, so I would get a second battery to install and better yet add the solar panel to keep them fully charged so you don't have to get out the ladder and change batteries.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2021"
206,PN,Huge connection issues,"  For cameras made to be placed outdoors around a house, the poor implementation of wireless in Ring devices implies that they believe you should have a router or access point placed in every crevice of your home.  The devices can barely pick up signals 10 feet away from a strong router, on the other side of a wall, yet their only use is outdoors. They encourage you to fix the problem with their access points being placed as close as possible to every camera, still with mixed results. Honestly, I don't know what the better option is, but if my phone is capable of picking up a strong signal from twice as far away outdoors, I don't see why they couldn't have solved this problem with a better wireless antenna.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2020"

208,Joshua Sangster,Poor battery life dooms this camera,  I have had this camera for over a year so this is no knee jerk reaction. The battery life is marketed as 6 months for one battery depending on things like how often motion is detected etc. But I get roughly 3 WEEKS total out of 2 batteries. I'm recharging them way too often and for me that's just not good enough for a $150+ camera. And that was from the get go - this isn't about the batteries being at end of life. I assume it will get even worse in the coming months. If you don't mind recharging the batteries every couple of weeks then this is a serviceable camera. Nothing special.

The cameras (and other devices like Alexas) would not work properly without them. We live in a rural area and have only one pathetic internet option. We have 4 Ring cameras and a doorbell. They all work flawlessly. The available linking features, like activating all cameras & lights when one detects motion, is extremely nice. We have additional chimes/WiFi extenders so we can always hear the doorbell even without having our phones nearby. The cameras sync to Alexa show her screens will notify and view as well. You can adjust the range of motion the camera looks at and notifies about.I love the neighborhood features and am looking forward to more features and how this network will grow.

210,Edwin Leister,"Easy and intuitive, does what it says.","  I installed this hanging down from the top of my Garage Door, (inverting the bracket) and aimed from the top corner  of one door diagonally across a sloping driveway.  It covers the driveway well, about 20' wide and 30' long.  Out of the box with a hand drill took me 5-10 minutes before it was installed, mostly just deciding how/where to drill, then it was up. I have a ring doorbell, an extra battery and charging station, which I recommend so you always have one ready to replace.  The camera has slots for 2 batteries but only comes with one in the box.  Since I already had a ring doorbell, I was familiar with the app and already was connected to Alexa, which found it right away without any issues.  I did set notifications not to ""announce"" because the cars are in and out so often, and I set the motion detection on the app to the exact areas of the driveway I wanted covered.  The light only comes on with motion detection during the night, which is fine, and it turns off pretty quickly.  You can manually view from the camera at night through the app with night vision or with the light on if you want.  It also can play a panic alarm if you want to spook anyone out of the driveway, which I mostly use to prank my teenager ;)  Good product, good company.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2021"

212,JO is my Name-O,Good value for the price,"  I’ve had two of the spotlight cams with solar panels installed for 9 months now. Overall, I’ve been pretty pleased with them and the Ring app. The solar panels work fairly well but struggled a bit in winter.I live in a cold climate and during winter between the cold sapping the battery of energy and the short days with clouds and not a lot of sun, I had to change the battery twice in none of the cameras. It’s a busy camera with 10–15 recordings a day and over time the battery drained. Once the temperature gets above 40 F though, the solar panel keeps the camera charged.Installation was very easy including the solar panel and the app setup was straightforward.  The app is pretty configurable and you have several options to adjust motion detection sensitivity.  No matter what though, I still get false alerts on motion. Mainly on bright sunny days with sharply contrasting shadows on the ground.I integrated the cameras with my Wemo light switches using a Smarthings hub which has worked great. Now when a camera triggers on motion, all the outside lights turn on.There are a few other annoyances like how long it takes for a video to become available for viewing after an alert, but overall, for the price, this is a gray setup that works well and I would definitely recommend it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2020"

I have the wireless cam which makes things much easier than needing to drill for wiring.The spotlight cam comes with 1 battery but can hold 2 batteries inside of it. My cam is in a pretty high volume traffic area and one battery alone lasts me around 3 weeks. I purchased a second battery for my cam so that when one battery dies, it automatically switches over to using the charged battery uninterrupted. It also allows me to still use my camera with its second battery when the first one needs to be charged.I’m very impressed with the quality of the picture, especially at nighttime.

215,AA,Revised Review Happier with Wired Version vs Battery camera,"  Update 5/12/20:I was contacted by an Amazon Ring Technical Support Representative after my initial review on the battery powered camera. This person was truly interested in making sure I was happy with my purchase. After several phone calls troubleshooting I have found that the wired version of this Ring camera is better suited to my internet/placement situation. I initially did not purchase the wired version because it meant drilling a hole in my garage, but after many attempts to adjust the wifi and camera settings the Ring Support Representative sent me a Chime Pro and then eventually the wired version of the camera. The representative was knowledgeable (even about my Orbi mesh system), friendly, and responsive. I feel that they have gone above and beyond and truly exceeded my expectations on helping me with the problems I was experiencing. There is still occasionally some delay between receiving a notification on my phone and pulling up the live video, but it is much, much better and I would recommend for folks that have issues with the live view/streaming to reach out to Amazon Ring support (not the Ring support general number) to get help.Initial Review: I have a ring doorbell and purchased this camera to add extra security to an area of our yard/house that we can't see. Right from the beginning I have had problems. It installed fine but live view would not work consistently on the camera (works fine on doorbell). So I searched support and decided that it could be my internet. So I purchased another Orbi satellite to install near the camera. The signal is excellent according to the Ring app. But I still had a problem. Then decided to upgrade our internet to fiber, so everything that connects to wifi is running super fast, however, not the Ring camera. Still problems, called support. They suggested I ""reset"" everything and after running various tests said it was my ""internet."" I again looked for solutions on the web and have found that sometimes those with Orbi mesh systems, which I have, report issues. I called support again today to ask about it. Again they had me reset network, test it on cellular and determined that I would just have to live with the delay or turn off wifi on my phone to connect to the live view a little quicker. Sometimes the live view won't even come up. If I am at work where the signal is poor then it won't even connect and just says ""streaming error."" I'm really disappointed in this product and their customer service. I would not recommend it especially if you have an Orbi router as there appears to be some problem with the connection.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 29, 2020"

We tested it after the sun went down an made it to both vehicles, made it in an out without the light coming on an seeing us. So, if I were a thief, I could have robbed us blind. Talked with Ring help and made adjustments to no avail. We even tried to put up some lawn lighting by the vehicles to see if that would help, it did a little, but still hit an miss on picking up motion.

Even with the extender right next to it it still says it’s not a great connection. And it looses connectivity so you have to go thru the programming process each time.

I have adjusted the range and position (which with the mount they provide is very limited) and if the wind blows it’s sends me a notification. For the money and time I’ve invested I could have bought something wired and more reliable. Wanted to love it but meh...UPDATEThe Ring team has really stretched out to make this purchase right.  They reached out to me early in December and after many emails and conversations, they sent me an additional battery and the the Chime extender to fix the problem.  It has eliminated the WI-fi issues! Maybe the advertising should have a disclaimer that the extender may be necessary in certain homes?At any ate they bent over backwards to make this right and I have a much higher opinion of the company and it's products as a result.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2018"

I like that they have privacy zones if you have part of your neighbor’s yard in your camera view and want to block it out. I just wish the privacy zones could be more customized to accommodate different shapes and angles. I also like the person only mode so that way a tree shadow won’t trigger my camera. I also bought a solar panel to go along with it but so far I’ve been running it on one battery that has only dropped 3 percent in battery life since installation over a week ago.Overall the camera makes me feel at ease knowing if I’m at work I can still keep an eye on my front door and even talk to someone at the door through the camera.

I will say that in terms of detection it’s still just ok. You have to be directly under it and stand for a moment to be detected. I placed it in a location where it “should” pickup every person passing. I had a car pull in to my driveway and there was no detection at all. No light or motion. No one can pass this area without the motion kicking in. I am just surprised how close you have to be just to be detected. I had hoped the zone would be large enough so I could detect people way before they got to my doorbell. So, it sometimes works great and sometimes doesn’t.

Good light. Great integration with cloud storage. Easy to set up with wifi.And I was able to see what times people were going through our alley. But then there were incidents where something definitely happened right in the camera's view, and nothing was triggered. I would adjust the sensitivity to where I would get notices for trees swaying in the wind, but somebody taking our trash can or leaving a pile of garbage in our neighbor's yard wouldn't show up at all.

Main issue, give us the option to 60 second recordings. 30 seconds is not enough to capture most events, you only catch the beginning but never the end.Second, warning for anyone reading this, if you can, get the wired version. The problem with the battery version is that there is a delay when any event starts so many times you can not catch what actually happened if the event was quick. This does not happen with the wired version.Third, need a better zone detection for motion like the wired versions. Obviously the camera has to point down angled once attached high on the exterior so the sensor is pointing back at the wall due to the angle.Fourth, need an option for color infrared like the wired cameras.

It’s also more convenient because you don’t need 20 different apps on your phone.Anyways, I had bought 2 of these cameras for my backyard do to the amount of break-ins recently in my neighborhood. I had been considering nest products for sometime, but when I discovered that in August they will not be compatible with Alexa anymore, the decision was solidified. I currently have a mesh wireless network, so placing these anywhere on my property is simple to connect. I have one up right now facing the main gate to my backyard. It has a very wide angle, but the picture quality at a long distance is not that great. Night time viewing is good, but could be better. Motion works fine for me, make sure you have an unobstructed view and it should work fine. I will be placing the other one in the opposite corner of my yard soon.

When I chose to return it to Amazon for a replacement on 07/23/19, the estimated replacement date was 08/07/19, about 2 weeks from now.  Amazon (admittedly unknowingly) sold a defective product and it takes 2 weeks to issue a replacement?  Is the giant slipping in customer service?Update (08/11/19) The replacement Ring Spotlight Cam came Friday, finally.  The battery cover seemed to snap closed reasonably well, but actually for the price I expected a more firm, snug attachment.  The surfaces had some minor marring suggesting I had received a refurbished device. If that’s the case, that is not acceptable. I purchased the initial device and the battery cover failed to remained closed OUT OF THE BOX. I expected the replacement to be new, just as I had purchased.  I will probably try to install it and see how it goes.  I have been less than satisfied with several purchases made through Amazon.com and I wonder if their quality control is slipping or if they are selling “seconds” or refurbs for a discount.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2019"

Set up with connecting to our network had a few problems and the response sound (person outside) could be better but overall I really like it. This system plus my dog, the posted signs, and my guns should make someone think twice!Update:Now that we've had this for a bit: the range the motion detector reaches far exceeds the stated description. This thing has handled some ofthe coldest, snowiest, iciest weather we've had in years. The first battery ran for 3 weeks and only got to 50% so I'm getting second battery and waiting until spring to install the solar panel I do advise getting a protective skin since it has saved me a lot of time and freezing to clean ice/snow off lens.

233,Matt,Perfect dog monitoring solution for no hardwired light,"  We were looking for a way to monitor when the dog needed to come back inside because he likes to lay on the back deck for a leisurely snoozle, but when he wants back in, HE WANTS BACK IN. But we didn’t have any power source outside the back door. So this battery-pack Powered camera with lights is the perfect solution! We have had it out there for a week and the charge is at 94% still. Granted, we put it on the lowest motion sensitivity since we are really only using it to check the live feed.Also one feature I was pleasantly surprised by, which wasn’t prominently displayed online is that you can mount it hanging from the eaves instead of directly into the siding of the house. I personally hate to drill holes into the siding so I utilized the vertical mounting option.

I work in IT and have tried everything from repairing, adding mesh access points, and even changing the signal strength of the 2.4ghz on my main router so it would permanently access one of the closer access points.

When I used to clicked on the ""Live"" button a live video would come up pretty quickly (within 2 seconds), but with each ""update"" the connection has gotten worse, bringing up ""live"" video takes a long time if at all and now it takes a good 5 minutes to playback any motion capture.  Ring needs to get better people to program their apps. It seems now it's mostly ""coders"" (people who knows the concept of programming but don't know how to write efficient code). And they need better QA people. How can you put out an update with the app barely working.  There is so much lag time with the videos it's extremely frustrating especially if you're trying to get ""live"" video instantly.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2020"
236,SA,Saved our front yard and water bill!,"  Really happy with this camera so far. We've had it for about 10 months and just ordered a few more for our backyard. So far we thankfully haven't had any suspicious activity on our camera, but this camera did assist us in finding out about a burst pipe in our front yard. We were out to dinner and a passerby rang our Ring Door Bell to let us know our front yard was flooding. We didn't answer it in time but checked our Ring Spotlight Camera immediately and we were able to see that our entire front yard was flooding. Luckily we were able to call some neighbors to go over to help and rush home to take care of the problem. Had we not had these two systems in place, we wouldn't have been  home for hours after the problem occurred which limited damage to our front yard as well as limited the water usage on our water bill!I definitely suggest purchasing the extra rechargeable battery packs (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076JKHDQT/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)  that go with this. We keep two in it at all times and recharge the dead one and replace.

237,Karen,WIFI Issues UPDATED,"  I like most of the features of the camera. However, Wi-Fi signal issues persist. Thinking of returning the camera to Amazon.  Camera is mounted above the garage door which I would think is a common place. Have a Wi-Fi extender Apple Airport right in garage. Still having problems. Can’t maintain a consistent strong signal. All other devices in my house are fine. Ring really needs to address this issue as I see it in many discussions and reviews.Update 09/04/19 -  I am providing an updated review as of September 4, 2019. I have been able to resolve my Wi-Fi issues by re-positioning the camera and router. That said, the reason that I am taking my time to update the review is the exemplary customer service that I received from the Ring company.  Within days of posting my initial less than positive review on Amazon, I was contacted by Alexis from Ring.  Her only  goal was to help me resolve the problem, not mentioning the review once nor trying to get me to change it. She was very knowledgeable about the product  and highly professional.  She patiently listened to my problem and helped to navigate potential causes/solutions.  In my opinion, I believe that the mark of a good company is how it handles problems. It’s easy to deal with positive reviews not always so easy to deal with the negative. In a world where good customer service seems to be a lost art, Ring stands out as the exception to the rule.  Great customer service. I would definitely buy another Ring product in the future.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2019"

I live out in “the sticks” as it were and all we can get is crappy att wifi at 5mbps if were lucky! I added an Orbi wifi signal booster and that’s helped greatly. I purchased the camera plus the solar charger ( didnt want to keep changing batteries out) it was easy to install and set up. Video quality is very good and the app works well and notifies me when it senses motion. Had it about a month now and the solar panel is keeping the batteries charged. I just checked and the left battery was at 100 and right at 94% respectively. I noticed when we have a few days of sun in a row (hard to come by this time of year) both are kept at 100% by the solar panel.As my trial date is expiring soon, I went and signed up for the Ring service which will allow storage of video clips/snap shots etc. I did the $100 for the year package. This will also allow me to add additional cameras (which I plan to do soon) and it will store that video as well.If I had better wifi Im sure my app/camera would be much better as far as how quickly I can access video/live stream video.

We also have the ring doorbell and could see every time a package was delivered for Christmas and actually talk to the delivery person. Simply awesome! Oh yeah, I'm adding the optional solar charger today. FYI, if you buy this camera, it only comes with one battery. Do yourself a favor and get another one because it holds 2.

For example, connectivity is a simple push of a button, follow the prompts on your Ring App and presto within a couple of minutes out of the box its up and running. I have 4 spotlight cam battery's and 1 ring doorbell. Another example is the App, which is virtually flawless. It has real time pictures boxes that can be viewed simply by scrolling down and choosing the one you want to examine closely. I like the fact that its all in one - neighborhood watch alerts, motion alerts, maps, blogs, comments...etc. The Ring App also has a two way talk, 120 decibel siren it think but if not its really loud and enough to scare of wood be thieves, and bright spotlight.3. The low subscription fees makes this a deal breaker. believe me shop around and you will see how much money you are not spending. SD cards are a hassle, no one will take the time to actually download them to your computer just to view nothing.4. The Ring product line is well made. Yes, there are others and yes there are those that are cheaper. If its cheap your looking for then the Ring is not for you. Ring is not a cheap product, the housing has a hard plastic and is weather proof. 3 of my Spotlight cam battery are in the baking sun and exposed to rain and dust.

   3rd Update: Alexis from support contacted me and ended up sending me a hardwired camera. Her customer support was excellent and let me know that with the hardwired version I could set motion zones. Which I could not with the wireless system and that was causing all the issues.If you have the camera mounted in a high traffic zone, do not get the wireless cam. Make sure you get the wired camera as you can adjust the motion zones.Very happy and satisfied with this purchase and will be adding more ring products in the future.Honestly I really want to like this camera. However after owning it for several days and playing around with all the settings it just doesn’t perform. It’s actually worse than a cheaper security camera that I bought off here.Numerous false alerts of nothing and if it’s raining out, forget it!  You will get nothing but false alert after false alert. It detects people when it feels like it and always doesn’t sense a person walking by. I’ve tried multiple settings and nothing has changed. However it loves detecting absolutely nothing as you can see from the video I posted. I get several of false alerts just like this but when someone walks through my side gate it only detects a person on occasions. So the camera is basically useless as I could live with all the false alerts as long as it picked up actual persons as well.This camera is an absolute fail!  Save your money and look elsewhere.Update: Alexa from customer support reached out to me and we tried to trouble shoot my issues and it’s determined that they will be replacing my camera with the hardwired model. I will admit that the customer support is a 10 star review on how proactive they were in reaching out to me to fix my issue.I will update my review once I get the new camera and see if it fixes my numerous false alerts.

The video quality is absolutely fantastic night or day and the install was super easy. The box came with everything you need to install, tools, screws, and good instructions. I also installed with a solar panel so I never have to recharge the battery which I highly recommend. The night vision works even better than the older stick up cam and the spotlight is extremely bright. Great option to use night vision to not bother neighbors or blast the spotlight combined with the night vision and the night video is just incredible. I really like ring products and have never been disappointed. My original stickup cam has been outside for over a year and a half and I haven't had one issue with it. I feel like this one is built even better so I have very high hopes for longevity with this new spotlight cam.

250,Leo,Motion detection is less sensitive at the normal direction then sideways in both light and camera,"  The motion detection for light is not sensitive in the center. A person walking from left or right side can be detected in reasonable distances. However, if I walk toward the camera from the center, the camera light doesn't turn on until I am very close to the camera. Both the light and the camera have a obvious higher motion detection sensitivity at left and right sides than at center direction.Ring Floodlight Cam has a cool feature to draw a motion detection zone defined by 5 or 6 points, but this feature is not available in this Spotlight Cam. I installed the camera at 8 feet high (1 foot higher than recommendation) above my garage door. No matter how I adjusted the angle of the camera (I set motion detection sensitivity and frequency to max), it  always started recording video a little bit late and missed the most critical moment.Bad packaging: a camera lens is normally pasted with a thin plastic film to protect the lens from scratching. However, this camera doesn't. I thought I might receive a used one. And also because of bad motion detection, I requested a replacement. Then I compared motion of two cameras. They are very different. One is dramatically worse than the other in detecting a person walking from the center (the Normal plane).One factor that I like about the product is the light.

I looked on Ring’s support site and there are numerous threads indicating this same issue with this device. In my case it happened early enough that my device is still under the warranty period BUT from what I hear in most cases this same scenario happened at around 18 months after the product is purchased and past the warranty period. For the price, I am regretting my decision to go with this brand. I typically do thorough research on a product before purchasing but unfortunately I was blinded by the hype in this case. Now I am suffering a serious case of buyers remorse knowing that this product is not made to last. Definitely do your research and do not blindly think that a big name would provide superior quality.UPDATE 6/10/20: Ring reached out to me immediately and assisted me with replacing the devices and assured me they will look into it if there are any additional issues. I was extremely impressed with their customer service representative Jessica and her prompt attention so I am increasing my rating to 3 stars for that alone.

I wanted to be able to use my Alexa device to see the front walkway on command and to be notified when someone was coming up the walk. This was a little expensive for what I wanted, but it manages - mostly - to do what I need.The pros:- Image is clear, audio is pretty good- reasonable battery life (7-20 days on one battery)The cons:- battery compartment is badly designed and alternates between not opening and not being able to be closed. Really annoying design.- even after tweaking all the available settings, I can't get the device to reliably pick up someone coming up the walk versus a large truck driving by (I did get it to ignore cars driving by, but any large delivery truck or trash truck still gets picked up)- the app is spotty and has some features (particularly the ""Neighbor's Feed"") are beyond obnoxious. Fortunately they can be disabled.I'd had the idea that I would also be evaluating this as a possible security device, but given the problems with either too many false trips or dialing it back and having it miss events, I don't think this is ready for that use yet.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2019"

The light turns on at night even though I have all light controls turned off. I don't need this to record at night. It is such a pain to take the batteries out each week to recharge them.

261,EHop,Blurry Video,"  I purchased this, because I was thrilled with the Ring Flood Light cam, but the image was immediately blurry. I contacted Ring support and although I told them all images were blurry, they claimed it was only the night vision and it was caused by where we mounted it. It was not just night vision though- it's always blurry. But, I moved it per Ring instructions and it was still blurry. We even brought it inside and set it right by the modem in case it was a problem with the wifi, but still blurry. So, this was disappointing and I returned it, as it was difficult enough to get someone out here to help me install it into a masonry home in the first place and I don't want to deal with it again.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2019"
262,Rob P,Feeling safer. Single mom with adult child with mental illness.,  I purchased the wireless option with two batteries. It took a month to receive the second battery but it is needed. 1 battery alone last 15 days. 1 battery w/ 2 in last longer. I was afraid of what the membership would cost after the 30 day trial. To my surprise it was only $30 for the year! Very affordable. Quality is superb. Only con is I had to take my flag down. The motion detector picked it up moving every time the wind blew. This is a great purchase!My adult daughter is mentally ill and I wanted to help track her attire and times of leaving. I had to report her missing/ endangered when she wouldn’t answer the phone or report home for her scheduled meds. I was able to provide a full description of what she was wearing and the last time she left the house. She was found the following day.

263,Kindle Customer,Not as good as I had expected,"  I did a lot of research before deciding on Ring as the camera system I wanted for my house. I watched a few YouTube reviews where they talked about the quality of the night vision and the brightness of the light. After installing this camera I can say that both the night vision and the brightness of the light are not what I expected. The IR lights don’t seem to be big enough and the normal lights on the camera itself are not bright enough to light up any decent sized space. If you’re looking for an outdoor camera with a decent amount of light, maybe go with the next step up that has 2 exterior lights.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2021"

About once a month it loses its wifi connection and I have to get out my ladder  to try and reboot it outside.

272,Britt,I am a Fan!!,"  I researched the various systems and decided to go with Ring.  It’s affordable, they offer a variety of products and it’s easy to install.  In addition, the monthly charge of $10 (multiple units) is affordable (or, $3/month, if you only have one unit). It took less than 20 minutes to connect to my WiFi and install.  I had no issues connecting to my WiFi or problems with it being installed at a distance from the router. I love the motion notifications, being able to turn on the units light on/off at night, the live stream, the units alarm capability and 2-way talk.  I also purchased the solar charger to eliminate the need for battery changes and thus far it’s all working as designed.  The motion sensor picks up everything including the dogs, wind chimes moving about and birds. I receive a pop-up notification with every movement but it’s a small irritation that’s easily tolerated.  If ever I don’t want the notification, it can be turned off. The range is great and can be easily adjusted from your phone. I started with one unit to see if I would be satisfied with the product.  I am a fan and will be adding additional units.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2019"
273,cany58,Motion detection consumes battery,"  First of all, I like the product for the purpose I bought it which is to be able to view in front of my house without having to run electrical wiring.  My complaint is that the motion detection picks up everything including the breeze blowing a dwarf palm in front, my sprinkler, the neighbor's cat, and even a moth flying in front of the camera.  Consequently, the battery only lasted about 6 days.  I have adjusted the motion zones and decreased the motion detection but it still picks up literally everything.  I bought an additional battery and recharged the other battery 2 days ago so I would have completely fresh batteries.  As of this writing, one battery is down to 67% and the other is still at 100%.  Maybe someone has some ideas for better adjustment of the motion detection.  I am the last house on a dead-end street so traffic is not an issue.  I can't do anything about the neighbor's cat prowling around or the insects flying around so if anyone has any suggestions I'm open to them.  On a positive note, the video quality is good.UPDATE - Alexis at Ring has been extraordinarily helpful so I'm upgrading from 2 stars to 4 stars.

Still working to figure out the perfect settings to eliminate false triggers that create records when nothing is there. I am told shadows can play a key role in this case.This by far not a professional security camera, so please don’t expect it to be so. Ring does a great job marketing and advertising their products, but don’t be mislead. Good product, but can be finicky which will never be admitted in advertisements.Overall I am now satisfied with the purchase.I will end with the customer service. Ring made several attempts to reach out to trouble shoot. Even when my schedule didn’t work with theirs, or if I was in responsive for days, even weeks. They made many fallow ups and are still to this day, checking in to see if I need further assistance.My original 1 star review has been upped to 3. I would probably have said 4 stars to begin with if I didn’t have to spend so much time and effort in the beginning to get this to work in a way I would be satisfied.Second time posting this review because amazon is crap. Not impressed at all. I have owned this less than 48 hours and experienced nothing but inconsistency. During the day it records everything moving with the slightest breeze. In the dusk/evening hours it won’t pick up any motion. The Motion sensor setting can be adjusted, yet it doesn’t help. I have moved the camera to different locations of the house, and still problems persist. I have two batteries, the solar panel to charge, WiFi extender, and a strong WiFi connection- all which is recommend, yet doesn’t make a difference. I can literally jump in and out of the motion zone without the camera triggering a recording, so what’s the point? The solar panel charging doesn’t even do anything, and it sits in an unobstructed spot on the roof where it receives clear and direct sun light for at least 8 hours a day. I am returning for a replacement in hopes it’s just a defective device, but I won’t hold my breath. In researching I have found not much positive in the battery version. Replacement isn’t scheduled to arrive for weeks, so who knows... I guess I will look for more reliable products.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2019"

278,Mac Hawes,Camera died in a year. Poor customer service and follow up.,"  Purchased the camera last September and had it outside. At first the constant battery changes were a huge hassle, so I bought a second battery. After that also became too much, I purchased a solar panel to keep it charged. On top of it I start paying for their online app service for it to actually record. I’m literally throwing money left and right at this company. After having it for 7-8 months the camera stopped working. I work in medicine and have a family and I’m sure you can imagine I’m a little busy. Fast forward a few months after this camera died, I try trouble shooting it to no avail. I call Rings customer service and they said something went out in the camera and it needs to be replaced. They offered me a worthless discount to buy another camera, since my warranty conveniently expired 30 days prior. So let’s do the math. $200 camera, $50 solar panel, $30 extra battery, $10 a month for 12 months. That’s $400 for low quality service and equipment.

279,Mac Hawes,Good little camera for the price,  We’ve had our battery spotlight cam a few weeks now. It’s a pretty cool camera. Things I like: it’s very easy to set up including downloading the ring app and connecting it to your WiFi. It comes with everything you need to mount it on your wall whether it’s onto wood or on your stucco. It even comes with a masonry bit to drill into stucco. I decided to mount it under the eve onto wood to protect it from the sun and rain. It comes with only one battery which you have to charge out of the box. It took about six hours to charge. Fully charge it before putting it into the camera. The battery only lasted me a couple of weeks probably because I played with it a lot. I bought a second battery since it can hold two. This keeps it running twice as long. The video quality is pretty good day and night. Just know that you may have to buy a WiFi extender like I had two because my camera is on the opposite side of the house from the router. You’ll know if yours is too far from the WiFi because the video feed will skip or pause. Buying the extender really helped out. I wish the battery life was a bit better. I’m overall happy with it and am planning on buying another one or two. You can add them all into one app. There is a wired version of this camera but know you’ll have to figure out how to run the power cord.

Video quality is all I would hope for and more for a camera at this price.The problem I have is with the motion detection. They advertise that you can set motion detection by distance, so I could say pick up the 40-50 feet from the camera that encompasses my driveway but not beyond as that's the public sidewalk and street. This sounded perfect for me but that's apparently not how it works.What I've been seeing instead is that it seems to be some kind of size/distance combination of motion that it detects. I'm trying to fine tune the ""distance"" to get the best range possible but this morning, for example, it did not detect me walking up my driveway until I was literally right under the camera but it detected my neighbor's car driving down the street. Yesterday, it didn't pick up my small SUV backing out of the driveway but picked up the UPS truck going down the street.When I tried to contact support, I exchanged about two emails with the support person, then was informed that the support person would be off the next two days, we could pick up with the issue after that.

I purchased it because my truck was stolen, and aside from that the neighborhood kids play on the street and hit cars at times. The point of a security camera is to have access at the time of a motion alert going off, right? Sometimes it loads for 30 second before opening and showing video, sometimes 5 seconds and sometimes it just doesn’t connect at all. It’s like a luck of the draw. The recordings saved but sometimes don’t actually start recording until the person is leaving the front yard, which defeats the purpose of a “security” camera. I’ve  moved the settings around on the motion but still no help. I guess I was just expecting too much but at the same time this is over $200, plus another $25 for extra battery.

I thought this was the deal because I wouldn't have to call an electrician to help me put these up, and they were $50 each camera. Little did I know, this version is NOT worth the money.Here is why:1.) Amazon won't let their installers put them in above 10 feet. I thought this was stupid, but they gave no explanation, and they REALLY didn't want to install them for me and talked me out of it. Had I known it was because this product only works when installed between 9 and 10 feet, I could have returned them before the return window ran out.2.) You have absolutely no control over your motion zones. Instead of giving you options for adjusting your motion zones, these cameras have a small halo motion zone that only works in about a 5 foot arch around the camera. That is great! My camera is safe, but my yard is stinking out of luck.3.) the battery life isn't bad, as long as you have two batteries in each one, you are in great shape!

I called Ring support to see if there was a way to extend the motion sensor range and was not provided any resolution or reason as to why it's such a short distance.  The only solution was to point the camera higher to cover the yard ... but then it wouldn't cover my deck and door (sigh).",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2019"

303,Robert Griffin,"Great battery option, motion detection setup could be better.","  Does an adequate job of capturing activity but the motion detection options are lacking compared to the wired spotlight and floodlight cameras I have.  I understand this is due to trying to conserve battery life, but I’m still struggling with either getting too much activity (cars passing by) or not enough (people almost out of frame before recording starts).  The controls allow you to turn on/off three zones in front of the camera and adjust the distance in which it is detecting motion using a slider. Unfortunately this ends up with a lot of guess work in setting up detection zones.  If the ability to set motion zones via live picture was there similar to the wired versions this would make tuning recordings much easier.It helps being able to link this camera to the others so it starts recording when my front door or driveway cameras detect motion, but it does eat into battery life.  Having two batteries does seem to help, and adding the aftermarket solar panel in direct sunlight definitely helps and keeps everything fully charged.  Decided to go the battery and solar panel option since I didn’t have good options for running power to this side of the house.The LED lighting is adequate, although not extremely bright, for a battery model is more than what I expected.  Illuminates the immediate area and provides adequate lighting for the camera view to show what's setting off the movement detection.  The night vision is okay at best, but its hard to tell whats going on outside of what's directly in front of the camera not illuminated by the IR.No issues connecting with my wifi router.  This camera is located outside the house about 50ft from where my router sits and has a very strong signal.The siren isn't  blaring loud, but I think enough to call attention to the surrounding area when manually activated.  I've used it to scare off a skunk and it worked well for that purpose.Overall, I’m happy with the outcome but hoping that Ring continues to improve the motion detection options on the battery model.  The battery model  is certainly a good option when not having a good wired power source, but I do recommend installing with a solar panel.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2019"

314,William Bailey,Beware of the Battery version,"  We have only had the camera about a month.  We do have to change the battery every few weeks because we have it in a busy area.  Loved everything about the camera until we needed to change the battery.  The first time we had to change it we had a lot of difficulty.  The battery is very easy to put in and out.  The door appears to be easy to open and close.  However, closing the door  so that it registers as closed is another issue.  No matter what we did the door would not register as closed, even though it was clearly closed.  And the camera will not function if the door doesn't register closed.  After messing with it for awhile we finally got it.  All good until the next battery change was needed.  This time it would neither register as closed or register the new battery that we put in.  This batter was fully charged.  I played around with it for over an hour and then my husband tried as well.  We finally called tech support.  He tried to tell us that we might need to take it down every time in order to close the door properly.  Not really wanting to do that, especially in the dead of winter and I did let them know that.  After running a few checks on his end he decided that he would replace it for us.  I was told that it would arrive in two days.  That was Wednesday evening.  So it should have been here either Saturday or Sunday.  When it did not arrive on Sunday I tracked it.  Not scheduled to arrive until Wednesday, an entire week later.

324,Joe,"Thank u, next. UPDATED: gets worse over time.","  I bought the Ring last year and have given it about eight months. Every time I try a new solution, it disappoints me. As you can read from other reviews, the video takes forever to load, so unless you pay for the video storage service, you probably won’t see the thing that set off your ring. It seems like a scam to force you to pay for the monthly video storage, else it’s useless to set up alerts.  Even when you try to get the live feed to check-in on your property, it’s a 50-50 chance your app will connect to the device at all.Let’s say you pay for the storage service... you’re lucky if the thing even goes off.  I can walk straight at it or approach it at an S-curve, and it won’t pick me up. I can even wave my hand in front of it, and nothing. Pull into the driveway - not a flinch. Yet occasionally, it’ll throw an alert when I leave my house/walk past it (rarely - maybe 4% of the time). Updating or reinstalling the app fixes most issues... for a day or two.  I even bought a Wi-Fi extender to improve the range to the device. Nothing.Regarding the battery -  this is the only reason I gave it above a one star. The battery lasts a decent amount of time still. Only annoyance is that it’s difficult to not re-position the camera when I’m putting the battery back in & pressing firmly on the door to close it.Finally, the video quality isn’t good enough to make up for the cons and the price. Plain & simple - it should be better.Save your money - don’t get this model. Maybe there will be a better version soon?? Tbd.Side note - the Neighbors app scares the heck out of me and has me trusting NOBODY in my neighborhood. Ignorance is bliss!UPDATE - what a shame. The customer service rep was so pleasant in helping to troubleshoot my issues. She helped me resolve the battery issue. Unfortunately, I’ve downgraded my rating. Since my last review, NOTHING could improve my connectivity, and it has gotten worse. Thanks for the extended trial of video recording, but I shouldn’t have to be forced to pay for that after my trial is over. Ring is unreliable and unable to connect to the device, especially when it detects motion and you’re trying to answer it. I will absolutely have to pay for the monitoring service in order to use my Ring. Save yourself the headache - avoid ring.

I have my spotlight cam battery centered on my garage to view my 2 car driveway and it is able to view both vehicles and the street for people walking by. Unfortunately 90% of my motion is not people even with person detection turned on. I recommend linking them to your other ring cameras to capture all angles simultaneously otherwise you may experience a delay in recordings. I also have the small solar panel and works great, 2 batteries installed and kept full in the SoCal weather.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2020"

Ring customer service acts like they never heard of the problem before & keeps wanting to send replacements. Until they fix the design flaw, not worth trying another unit - too hard for me to re-install. I wish I had electric outside so I could hardwire it.

333,jford,Spotlight doesn’t always stay on long enough,"  I love my Ring Spotlight Cam. It works great for the most part. Sometimes at night, the spotlight only turns on for 30 seconds and is off long before we even get out of our vehicles and doesn’t turn back on. Usually it’s just me or my husband, but what if it was an intruder and we weren’t near our phones to live view? Then other times, it’ll stay on the entire time. Also, our battery died less than a month. Mostly because we have an annoying squirrel that sets it off 10-20 times a day. Still a bummer tho. Otherwise, I love it and the app works very smoothly. I’ll be investing in the solar panel soon!",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2018"
334,Nathan D.,Works great,"  After installing this camera, along with the solar panel, I’m very happy with this camera. It captures movement quickly, the led spotlights are great and the solar panel keeps the batteries charged (one battery has always been at 100% and the second battery never below 95%). The app is very useful and it is easy to delete captures, which so far have just been of me. It was easy to install and setup. I am confident that the camera and notification will help keep me aware of possible intruders. Update: After using this camera for 6+ months, i was having issues with Live View. I finally talked with Ring customer support, and after assistance from 2 individuals, the issue was resolved. The tech support people were great, pleasant and knew what they were doing.

335,AmazonAddict,Waste of money,  I bought this to overlook my front door and driveway.  I have a corner lot so the road runs parallel to my driveway then bends around to where my driveway exits.  I positioned the camera so it would see my whole driveway from the side.  The camera would pick up motion in the road on the other side of my driveway but would not pick up motion in my driveway or up the walkway to the front door.  it would then only pick up motion if you were standing directly under it.  I called tech support and tried a few different locations and still had the same problem.  after almost 2 hours on the phone with them i decided to just return the camera.  They refused to admit there could possibly be anything wrong with the motion sensor.  and were unable to explain why it would pick up motion far away and up close but nothing in the middle.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2020"
336,casualcow,Good camera for small motion coverage,"  It has a decent picture quality, but you can typically see more on the camera than what the motion camera sees. For instance, someone will appear on camera and be midway in the lens, and then you finally get a notification. Which is due to a small motion sensor range, even with it on high sensitivity and full coverage. If you need to cover a big range, I would look to the Ring Floodlight Pro.

So easy, user friendly and intuitive. I have one of these outdoors and the other I chose to put indoors, even though this is supposed to be an outdoor camera. I loved the spotlight feature and wanted to utilize that as a deterrent in my house at night as well. This camera has everything that you could possibly need to secure any part of your home or property. I find the battery life to be sufficient (I found having a couple extra batteries to be helpful as they take about 6-8 hours to charge completely) and I may invest in a solar panel for my outside unit.

It doesn’t always pick up when we pull into the driveway with our cars right in front of it,  but it will detect a bird flying by or a rabbit hopping by!  It’s not very reliable IMO. It was picking up traffic going by, so it’s been adjusted and now it mostly only gets the trash truck at the street when they pick up trash but on the other hand, again, it doesn’t always get us when we pull into the driveway. That is concerning because what if someone came to the house and pulled into the driveway when we are not home but hey, I’ve got the trash truck picking up my trash.

341,DD Gott - Donadees Corner,Motion Detection is horrible.  Do not recommend purchasing.,  First off the software for this device is poor.  When setting motion zones you can't see what the camera is seeing.  You have a graphic that you can increase/decrease the detection area and only three motion detection areas.  I have this camera above my driveway.  When I pull in I expect it to detect me.  It does about 50% of the time.  Ring needs to do a much better job and motion detection.  How about anything moving faster than 10-15 miles an hour it ignores.  I also own the Ring Doorbell.  It's software is a little better and I have had better luck with it but it still doesn't catch everything.  Not sure what the point of a security camera if it doesn't work 100% of the time.

The wifi signal can be weak at times which is probably due to my old router. However, I usually do not have any issues at recording motions or check the live view. The only small downside is the extra money you need to spend if you want to safe your recordings. Ring offers different plans, but if you have more than one device it will cost you $10/mo in order to safe your recordings. Other than that I don't have any complaints.

They also only give you one battery and it's pretty easy to take it out and disable the camera.  plus if you have the camera in a hard to reach spot that means multiple trips on the ladder.I think they need to spend more time thinking this product through, also I know they are all about getting your subscription dollars but they really should build a locally stored dvr that connects via wifi or hardline to the interwebs so you can have your film to review locally and globally.

After 6 months, RING has still CONTINUED to ignore the request of thousands of iOS users requests for the ability to disable SAFETY REPORT notifications on our platform. From what I can tell, this has been going on much longer than my 6 month experience. It is really starting to feel like a deliberate slight  on all iOS users3. No direct IP access to the camera  or video feed, so it cannot be tied in wot a network of  other IP security cameras.4.

They sent a replacement, checked up that I received it, checked up the next day to see if it was working properly (it was), and I am now a happy camper with about 8 various Ring devices.

377,Robert,I really want this camera to work better!,"  I have two cameras....the first couple of months they worked great.  I had to do some adjusting to the motion sensitivity (lowered to 4); otherwise, they worked as expected.  About three months in, all of a sudden I started getting multiple notifications per day. I would get 4-5 ""person"" notifications and up to 100 motion recordings per day.  I contacted Ring tech support, and he advised for me to increase my settings to maximum.  He didn't have an answer when I questioned if this would increase my notifications, but I reluctantly increased it to the maximum setting.I immediately started getting approximately double the notifications and motion recordings.  I thought this would be temporary, but as of noon today I already had 5 ""person"" notifications when all of them were vehicles driving by.  I contacted Ring tech support again, and the first thing she told me to do was lower my motion sensitivity settings and she couldn't understand why the other guy told me to increase it.  She wanted me to lower to a zero and then manually check the sensitivity (I could not do this because I am not at home).  So, I will be calling back again tomorrow afternoon when I am there.Overall, the cameras are okay.  The customer service is terrible, and so far both people that I have talked to have only spoken broken English at best.  They are very hard to understand, and I had to ask them to repeat what they said several times.

The spotlight is pretty bright but the SOS alarm remains untested. Also lesser advertised, the boxiness of the camera is because, although it comes with only one battery, it has room for two batteries!!

This being battery operated made it perfect so I could put it anywhere. My only minor complaint is the battery life, and lack of second battery being included. It is nice that there is a spot for a second battery since the light on the cam drains the battery much quicker than our Ring doorbell, but I feel a second battery should really be included since the battery life is so much lower.

It will switch to the second battery once the first is nearly flat.)Pro's* Easy to install* Can be installed anywhere, no wiring required* Good quality video / sound* Decent battery life* Spotlight lights up my entrance way very well* Based on my current settings (most sensitive) large insects flaying near-by have activated the motion alerts (For me this is a plus, as I know a person will definitely activate it)* Ability to have two batteries so no downtimeCon's* Camera is in standby mode until motion is detected so no pre-recording* Camera takes a second to start up recording once motion is detected* Inconsistent motion activation* 4-6 hour battery charge timeOverall, if you have an area you would like a camera, but don't have easy access to wiring / don't want to run wiring this is a great alternative.  I would recommend spending the money on the solar panel and/or a second battery.  Do to the long recharge time a second battery allows for no downtime as the camera automatically switches from the flat battery to the charged one allowing you to remove it and recharge it as needed.

He used a crow bar on the door but then he closed and locked the same door once he was inside the condo, so it truly appeared like an unsuccessful forced entry attempt to unsuspecting people like me and my sister. She and I were about to unlock and open the door when we decided to call the police instead. Little did we know, the trespasser was on the other side of the door ..... with a loaded 9mm handgun, a large hunting knife, and an unloaded AR15. The only thing that kept us from walking in on him and his weapons was a split second of common sense. Once the police investigation was done and the adrenaline wore off, the first thing I thought about was security and the very next thing I thought about was Ring.I ordered Ring via Prime and it was delivered next day. Everything about Ring is AMAZING. The set-up and installation were engaging and simple. I love being able to access options and modify settings via the Ring app and website from anywhere and anytime. The cam is tucked into the eave over my front door so it's barely noticeable. The footage and image clarity is awesome. I can share footage with friends and family and link them to my camera as added users. The motion detection zone and alerts and everything is customizable to perfectly fit your needs and preferences. The Ring Neighborhood community is another benefit, keeping people in your area involved and aware of what's going on in your vicinity. And the choice to purchase additional protection plans for a monthly charge of $3 or $10 cannot be beat. We're ordering more products for my condo and my mom's condo now that I've been the guinea pig for the first purchase!My only regret is that I wasn't proactive about purchasing Ring BEFORE the incident. I cannot change the past, but going forward I have the peace of mind that I need and that my family needs. Thank you, Ring!!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2019"
417,Pskizzle,Works incredible,"  I am very impressed  with the  ring spotlight cam it is very clear and picks up motion all the way out to the street which is what I wanted to make sure that no one can approach that side of the house without being detected. It was super easy to install and I’ve had it for two weeks and so far the battery is still almost full. I also have a ring doorbell, as well as my home security is also the ring security and I love those as well. The app that you use to access all of your cameras and be home security is extremely easy to use and very well laid out and makes it very easy to view the videos and share them when needed.Coupled with my Amazon Alexa as the system is easy to arm and or view on my Alexa spot.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 12, 2019"

I have 3 doorbell cams, two spotlight cams, and one solar powered cam that I have gotten over time, and now Ring is bugging me about Ring protect being about to end when I already set up auto pay.  The cameras work fine, but only one can connect at once, so they miss anything that moves from camera to camera, and by the time we get a notification of activity and try to respond the person has long ago left.

The motion picks up the distance, but is hit or miss closer to the property.  The camera drops from the wifi.

The battery doors are fickle when closing them. Hang them at a convenient height and rely of their theft guarantee. They are frustrating enough to get solar panels, which I have on all four) so you don’t have to close the door! 2. They are great about providing all the tools you need. ALMOST!

Motion detection gets 4/5 stars because you cannot block off certain areas in the camera’s field of vision.As in...my camera covers my driveway, so it can look over my vehicles and property, but I can’t narrow the field of view to not see every car that goes by on my street.I have a couple Blink cameras and they CAN do this...so I know it is well within reach to have them be able to do that.Besides that one issue, the cameras work flawlessly.

I got rid of a multiple thousands of $ professional system as the wires, connectors, cables and camera components would corrode and became unserviceable. The Ring spotlight-shows no corrosion after 6+ months, so I just added 2 more for a total of 4 devices. Night video needs to be better quality. Ring may want to lessen motion sensitivity vice just lessening range. Birds set off the motion detection.

426,Missie,Great camera - easy to setup and use - get some peace of mind,"  We love this thing. It’s provided us visibility into our front porch area after a couple amazon packages mysteriously disappeared. We are able to see who is coming and going, when packages arrive, speak to door to door solicitors without getting off the couch, etc... some have complained of the motion trigger but for us it’s worked well. There is a little delay from the time you get a notification to the actual viewing of the camera, but that’s just the nature of the beast since it’s a WiFi device, these things take time... overall it was easy to install, easy to use, and the annual subscription for cloud storage is reasonably priced.

427,Tripp,Love the camera but not thrilled with rings storage plan...,  I love this camera!! Put it facing my driveway and it has great picture of my entire cul de sac. It seems to have less lag than my ring pro doorbell. I would say motion lag is about 2 seconds. I love that it can take two batteries already ordered another one. My only complaint is ring charges me for each device for my plan. So I will now be paying 60 bucks a year for my doorbell and 1 camera.... this is so my videos are stored. I think that’s crazy when Arlo and blink have free storage! That’s why I rated 4 stars instead of 5.

428,BDR,Good camera,"  It works as advertised. It's reliable. If it's by a door you use often, the battery will run down fast, so I'd pick up an extra one.  The only reason I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars is that the bottom door (where you install the battery) is difficult to get it to catch. You have to close it half a dozen times before it finally stays closed. It may just be the one that I received.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2021"

Top notch service.I was very excited to hook this up in my back yard area. I already have the Ring Doorbell Pro and we love it so I figured this would be just as good. WRONG!!! Setup was simple and I quickly noticed that the motion detecting notification had to be turned off. Before, everytime a bug flew in front of the light my phone was going off. It will still record but now I have to go in to the app to see the video. Also set the sensitivity to low and it still picks up all flying bugs or my dogs.

I already have the ring doorbell so I knew what to expect with how these will respond to motion and activity.But what is with the Solar panels they sell with these?  I received, what appeared to be a brand new solar panel, in original packaging and sealed with tape which didn't appear to be replaced.  I installed the panel about a month later because I wanted to see how long the battery would last without it (about 4-5 weeks using standard settings).  But the panel seems to only charge up to 3% and then nothing more.  I sent an email to amazon.advocates@ring.com to see what response I would get.  I already threw the packaging away since the product appears to be very well made so I didn't think I needed it.  I'd like to see if a replacement panel would work but some of the reviews don't look promising.  A lot of them are indicate that the panels don't work or barely enough to keep the battery charged.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2019"

465,S. Brassard,"Easy to Install, Easy to Use!","  This is a great camera.  I Installed it in front of my garage overlooking my vehicle.  The Install process was very easy, but just incase if  you're having trouble, Ring has a customer support line you can call for assistance.  A big plus to me, was when I was un boxing my camera I found,  that, not only did  Ring provide me the equipment needed to install my camera, but the tools, as well. The only reason I'm rating this 4 stars and not 5 is because of the battery that comes with the camera.  After charging the battery for 8 hrs I checked the battery life this morning, after the first night of use, and found I lost 5% of battery after only one night.  Now,  I did have the motion frequency on ""Standard"", which I brought down to ""Light"", Video settings is in on ""Live View"" which does drain the battery, but not something I'm willing to change, and ""Audio Streaming and Recording ""  again another feature that I'm not going to turn off.  We'll see how long this one battery charge will last, but more than likely I'm going to have to buy a back up battery for my camera, BTW this camera can fit 2 battery packs, so if you buy a 2nd battery , you don't have to be switching them out when one battery runs out. Overall the performance of this camera and sound quality is great.  The app is user friendly,  and again, if you're having trouble with anything Ring has a dedicated customer support team, that will walk you, step by step through resolving any issue you may encounter.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2020"

469,MoodyMuse,Loose Battery Compartment Door,"  The Ring Spotlight Cam Battery camera has been mostly great.

With a bit of a shake of the camera the battery door pops open. A few times I've gotten alerts about the battery door being open. This is easily the frustrating thing with the camera, and I do not know if it's all units that are like this or just my particular unit. I also have to charge the battery about every 2-3 weeks, which is not surprising because its located at the front of the house and captures a lot of activity on the street.

482,Jack,UPDATED REVIEW 4/11/2020 Beware this product.,"  Since leaving the previous review, we were contacted by an Executive Support Representative(KikkI).  She spent a significant amount of time on our issues, first getting the replacement product sent to us quickly and then working with us to get the product to work.  Unfortunately, we were not able to get the Ring device to connect to our older router (no fault of the product) so we had to return it.  We were very impressed with the lengths that our Ring Support Representative went to in the hopes of getting the product to work for us.  Once we get a new router, we hope to give the device another try.  So the 5 stars are for the level of customer service we received from Ring.We received this security camera from Amazon on March 6 and attempted several times over several hours trying to set up the WiFi, using all the guides and troubleshooting provided online. We finally called tech support at Ring and went through pretty much the same troubleshooting routines that we had just done. The tech we spoke to finally decided that the unit was defective and promised a quick replacement. However, since we purchased it from Amazon instead of directly from Ring, they insisted that we ship our faulty unit back to Ring before they would ship a replacement. We sent it on March 8 and have yet to receive a new unit. So now we have no camera, no refund, and no patience left. Not happy .",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2020"
483,Jack,Excellent Customer Support,"  Ring Spotlight's big advantage is you can set off an alarm, a very bright light, and you can remotely listen and speak to an intruder.  I added one Ring and many Blink cameras inside and outside my office. Between the two I have made it very hard to case my office without being filmed from multiple angles and had two incidents where these camera's allowed the local police to remove an intruder at 2-3am from my business's front door. They work well together, Blink camera's are small, low cost, and low maintenance so you can put many of them up inside and outside at every angle. Ring has more capability with a brighter LED to flood light at an intruder's eyes in the middle of the night, you can speak and listen to them so they know they are watched (and possibly law enforcement is on the way), and hit  them with a 100+ decibel alarm.

It takes 45 seconds to a minute to connect to Live view. Sometimes even longer for whatever reason. It is totally different from say, the ring doorbell pro where it is connected to a power source. It connects right away when looking at live view. I wish I would have gotten the wired version of this instead. I would stay away from this camera and get the wired version.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2019"

Just 2 weeks of battery life on medium motion detection settings2. Sound quality in both directions across the speaker can be crackly3. 30 days of cloud storage without paying the subscription fee to Amazon / Ring. After that you can view live video ONLY.The Ugly:1. 50% of the time you receive a black screen when trying to view live video. You have to disconnect and reconnect the live multiple times to see anything. This is particularly common around 2:30 to 3:00 PM when kids are coming home from school.2. The door at the bottom covering the battery enclosure often becomes open and hangs down.

527,Dr. Quality Assurance,So far impress.,  Its been about a month in a half since I install the camera. Reading the reviews some complain about the battery life and with the wifi signal. When it comes to the battery I am using one battery for now and with the first month the battery life didn't last long and that was due to me playing with it and activating the live feed constantly it only lasted two weeks. Since I have left it alone and pretty much let the camera do its job it have yet hit the 50% mark on the battery life and this is coming near the end of the one month. As for the wifi signal I am using a wifi extender that I already had before I purchase the camera and it works really well so far however it does have it moments where I will not be able to access the camera while at home or away so therefore I had to unplug the extender and then its works fine. As for being able to access it when miles away from the camera I have yet to experience it but did try to the right after it I install it. Cant really say if it was due to the wifi be not working at the time or I had happen to be in a area that I wasn't receiving much of a phone service so therefor at the time I was having a hard time accessing it. Over all I am happy with it. I only give it a 4 star due the every now and then issue of not being able to access the live feed.

528,Scott S,Would recommend,  Motion detection is a little hit or miss. Have received a couple of false alerts but overall alerts work well. My reason for purchase was based more on having a camera in a specific area that didn't have power and I was unable to a cat 5 cable to connect one of my other cameras for my security system and it has definitely filled that need. The wifi signal is a little weak based on where the nearest access point is but it performs at an acceptable level. The product came with one battery and I ended up buying an additional 2 so that I can rotate. In hindsight I probably would only buy one additional. The camera uses only one at a time so the second battery is 100% when the first needs to be pulled to charge.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2020"

530,AZ bread maker,Be aware the battery version has less features than the wired one - UPDATED,"  Camera and apps were easy to install and seem very good...HOWEVER, i was surprised find that the battery-powered device does not offer the same options to adjust distance & sensitivity as it seems the wired version offers (and i just confirmed with Ring customer service).  There is NO option to adjust sensitivity at all...only distance...and even that is only separated into 3 non-customizable zones.. you can turn a zone completely off or on--no inbetween....the distance slide controls the WHOLE field of view-not each individual zone.  From what i can see on their website, the wired version also has a ""motion sensitivity"" setting where you can choose to trigger by ""people only"" or ""everything"" with a slider to adjust everything in between the two....that would be MUCH more helpful as my device triggers anytime the wind blows my trees....UPDATE:  After posting this review, i was contacted by an incredibly helpful representative from Amazon/Ring Executive support.

I did everything I could for Ring camera to run at optimal performance, WiFi was great, it was installed at the height the handbook recommended and I took the time to call Ring customer service for recommendations. The battery needed to be charged every 1-2days, which meant your camera wasn’t on for a period of time while it was charging. This is to be expected but when your camera spends more time charging then actually fulfilling it’s purpose of providing a safer environment then that’s a cause for concern. There are other options for longer lasting battery, like buying another battery or solar panel but a camera priced at $199.00 there should be no need to spend more money on this product at the price point that it retails.

Yes, it’s an extra $30, but you double your time between battery switches.  I’m closing in on three weeks installed and one battery is at 100% while the other is at 92%, so should see long life.

554,Me Kennedy,Long term ownership review - not good,"  Updated Review -I've owned 2 of these now for a good many years.If I could do it all over again - and I probably will - I'd go with a different system all together.I also own the ring doorbell too.This is the issue with this platform. The app is very glitchy. Plain and simple.It works a lot of the time, but just about every time I NEED it to work it will get hung up, not connect, not open, not load etc... Example getting a notification in the middle of the night that someone is in my backyard, or someone ringing my doorbell while I am not home etc... I try and open the app and it just spins for 5 minutes and not open or connect.I also found that if the device was recording - aka it had alerted me of movement and was still recording - and I tried to connnect to it to see who it is etc it will almost always not connect. Even after I wait a minute for it to stop recording it will not playback the recording for what seems to be an eternity.The whole reason I bought this was to be able to see real time what is going on and it just seems to fall on it's face each time I had situations when I wanted to do that.It will work great when I'm not in a situation like that and I'm just checking on things in general...Next - recording clips.The length of the recordings are just too short to be of any help. Really - for a security system you want something that is going to record for longer - 3 minutes perhaps. This is difficult with something like this which runs off of batteries of course but as I said - if I were to re-do this I'd get something hardwired that could do longer recordings.Lastly - the solar panels on these don't seem to do well in the winter. We had a few very cold spells and the batteries in both my spotlight cams died. Even though they had solar panels attached (new) and we had very sunny weather. These should be rated for colder temps.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2018"

(With extra battery included)We live on a fairly busy street in a condo complex, wiring a camera just wasn’t an option so we settled for this. So far, it’s been great. For how busy our street is, it picks up nearly every car driving by on the street (which I dont mind), one battery we put in at 100% and the other was around 60-65% and in 4 days with a lot of people coming and going and the cars passing by the battery level has dropped down to 48% and the other is still at 100%. We even caught our postman skipping our place completely and marking our address ‘undeliverable’.PROS: Super easy install, captures everything in crisp clear detail, night feature you can have night vision on only (to save battery) or have the motion detected light turn on, you can hear EVERYTHING and the talk back and alarm features work well and are extremely loud, you can adjust the range of where exactly you want motion to be detected and has quite the range and great sensitivity (which also can be changed based on how often you want to be alerted)CONS: WiFi Range, we had to purchase the TPLINK 750 WiFi extender in order to get a proper connection and signal. We don’t live in that big of a place so the fact that the WiFi signal was so poor was kind of a bummer. That’s literally the only reason I gave it 4 stars.FWIW; I see a lot people complaining about battery life and honestly, it’s to be expected with how much goes on in our neighborhood. I wouldn’t expect the battery life to diminish NEAR as quick at all on a private residence.

Amazing, I put it back in the mount and the motion detector still works!  I think, however it may have broken the light. Lesson learned:, make sure the retaining screw is very tight. Also, it seems a month or two should be your best expectation for battery life.  Of course, this is usage dependent.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2020"

604,Steven Rodgers,Motion sensor sporadic.,"  I am considering return the Ring Camera to Amazon.  The motion sensor will pick up cars driving by but won't pick someone walking up to my door until they are only a few feet away.  Tried adjusting the Motion Settings but it hasn't helped. .  I bought it specifically to let me know if someone was near my car in the driveway as there have been teens pulling on car doors at night.  The camera is pointed at the car.  Also, when the alert sounds,  it takes a while to see the image.  It says "" Device Activating"" or video is processing. .  Maybe someone can tell what I'm doing wrong.Update: 10/28/2019.  I was scheduled for a callback on 10/25.  No one called.  I tried different motion settings but nothing helps.  If the setting is low I cant see individuals walking  up my walkway until they a 4-5 feet away.  However,  I still get alerts from cars driving by 30 or 40 feet away.  The whole point in me  purchasing the camera was to monitor my driveway and walkway  not cars driving by.  It is basically a $200 video camera.  Besides, I don't want to pay $3 per month to see cars driving by. It will be returned to Amazon.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2019"

Otherwise, there are all kinds of issues.It will pick up people walking their dogs on the sidewalk or the tree in the front yard on a windy day, but if someone pulls in my driveway I won't be notified until they've reached my door. I can pull in my own driveway and won't hear the little chime until I've reached the front porch. I've tried moving the camera, adjusting the sensitivity and range, and I still can't find a happy medium.WiFi connectivity is so-so.It is actually simple to set-up. I'll give them that. But functionality does not warrant the price tag.

A poorly designed bracket forces you to point the camera in a fixed position instead of being able to adjust to desired angle.

It does however have some nice and useful settings to help you customize when it records, and how often it will notify you of movement.  Another downside is it has a temperature limit so if you live in a cold location you can't have the camera outside during the winter or it will break.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2019"

BUT, it is solar powered and I was able to place it where there is no existing power and that is a BIG PLUS.

Hitting “live” just sends the camera to a black screen where it struggles to connect.The second disappointment comes from the camera’s recording lag. On two separate occasions we’ve been alerted to movement on our door step, one at 1:40 am and the other at 4:00 pm, and when we go to look at the footage we can hear footsteps but see nothing.

It couldn’t be my internet connection because i was doing This inside the house before i mounted it and my download and upload speed was 120mbps. I sent it back for a replacement and the replacement worked fine. Picture was clear motion and recording was working perfect. Then once in a while it would do the same thing as the first one when i would pull up to my driveway and later start working again.

If you are properly set up with good internet and range, you will have a great experience using this spotlight cam. Just a word of advice, if you choose the spotlight cam with the rechargeable batteries, buy the extra battery, and a must have, purchase the spotlight cam plug in battery charger, this will keep your batteries fully charged at all times, saving you from having to constantly remove the batteries for in house charging.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2019"

It’s fantastic when you don’t have cabling etc already where you want to place it and you can easily add the solar panel which i ended up doing anyway as i didn’t want to have to pull the battery to charge it. Also, perfect addition to the Ring ecosystem.  My only complaint and not really a complaint, more of a request, is that the motion sensor is sensitive and it would be great to draw zones like you do on the doorbell versus the depth chart.  Motion does work great, just very sensitive.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2019"

963,Ninja Mom,Horrible Customer Service,"  Initially, every time there was motion in our front yard we received an alert on the cell & a video snip.

Then yesterday I could only have access to a ""live view"", but was no longer getting motion alerts.I took a break at work (busy clinic) & went on to read that you MUST pay an annual fee to receive motion alerts. So I was forced to sign up, $30 was not too bad at all. However, we realized that some one had been on our property messing with the irrigation ditch in the front yard. Water rights are a big deal in this county and some one trespassing on my property is an even bigger deal. I started scrolling through the Ring activity log yesterday and none of the videos would come up. I work in a busy clinic and did not get a chance to keep up with alerts. When I contacted customer service via chat, her name was Linda, she offered me no help at all. She said the videos were not accessible and we should have signed up sooner. How about ring being more up front with what ""upgrade"" means. So, basically you have to pay an annual fee for the camera to function properly. How about Ring state that instead of offering an upgrade. I am so mad. I have no idea who was on my property (rural) while I was 50 minutes away at work. I bought this for security, for the motion alerts, and for peace of mind. I am so disappointed.

1072,Niki Nicole,"Cheap Plastic Build Quality, Somewhat Large..Picture Was Sharp and Clear. Other Cameras in market that are better for less monty","  I really wanted to like this camera. I purchased off the Amazon Treasure Truck so my price was really good upon purchasing. However, when I hooked it up, that's where I began to feel different about the quality of this camera. The build quality is modest at best. It is a LOT of plastic and after inserting the battery and closing the battery compartment I didn't feel as this camera would stand up to the elements mostly rain in a heavy storm. The range on this is terrible. It would record the motion videos but never send the alert to my new Samsung Galaxy S9+. Video quality was better than I expected. Now, I had been using the first ARLO system's cameras for the past 3 years. Although only 720, the cameras did everything else great (in fact better than the Ring Spotlight camera). Build quality on the ARLO cameras was excellent and SO much easier to install and setup. No drilling four holds to mount the base and then having to adjust and tighten the camera on a swivel mount. These cameras are also very BIG. More noticeable and stick out much more than the old ARLO cameras I had. Some might feel this is good as a deterrent to crime. The lights on the Spotlight camera system were a nice touch and could be activated manually or set to turn on upon a motion in front of camera automatically at night if you toggle that option in the app. The siren wasn't that loud but for effect it works. Compared to the siren on the ARLO system and I find it better. The alarm on the ARLO is at the base station not on the outside cameras. I don't know about how long the batteries last as I took it down today (the same day I set it up). My bottom line is...if this thing had worked more similarly to the performance of my Ring 2 doorbell it would be a better piece of equipment. I only paid $139.99 for my one camera.

1333,Lewis ,Hyper sensitive to WiFi strength,"  I really, really want to like the Ring products.  When they work well they are fantastic.However, they are very sensitive to the quality of the WiFi signal.  That signal needs to be *extremely* strong in order for Ring products to be functional.I installed the Sportlight Cam approximately 30 feet away from my nearly new Linksys AC2200 router.  There is only 1 wall between the camera and the router.Very close in proximity, but the RSSI within Device Health for this camera in the Ring app is 72 (poor connection).  RSSI is the term Ring used to measure the signal health.  Ring support says that number should ideally be in the mid 40’s to low 50’s.What does it take to get your RSSI to that, or lower?  I have a Ring Doorbell Pro that I was having signal strength issues with as well.  Support send me a a Ring Chime to help resolve the issues.  A Ring Chime is pretty much just a WiFi extender.I have my Ring Chime installed about 4’ (yes, 4 feet) from my Doorbell Pro and am getting an RSSI of 36.  These products seem to almost have to be right on top of your router (or WiFi extender) to work properly.This isn’t feasible and, in many cases, isn’t possible.  I don’t have an outlet available near where the Spotlight cam needs to go.If I have to install a WiFi extender for each Ring product that I install (which is what it is looking like would have to happen), then I’m probably dealing with the wrong product.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2018"

1396,Dorin,The picture quality and features are better on the wired version,"  ordered one battery & one wired spotlight cam.  Between the two i prefer the battery version.  I ordered a second battery.  I'm estimating i'll get about 10 weeks of charge per battery based on my previous few weeks of usage.  Obviously the more you use live view and the spotlight the faster your battery will drain.  I had an incident when i left the spotlight feature on motion and it drained in one day.  You can just pop out the dead battery and charge overnight while the backup runs the camera.  The picture quality and features are better on the wired version.  Battery version doesn't allow you as much flexibility for motion zones.  My 2 problems with the wired version are 1) the light setting automatically turns itself on every few days.  Not sure why this keeps happening.  i have to manually go turn it off a few times for the setting to take place.  Kind of frustrating.  2) the wire is a bit hard to hide (IMO).  I don't think this is necessarily a fault of ring.  It is what it is... if you want the wired version you'll have an ugly wire that you'll need to hide.  Again, performance is better on wired but i would prefer the battery because of the flexibility",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2018"

This is a Spotlight, while in some cases people may thing that is the same thing as a flood light it is not. Ring does make a flood light and it is a good product in my experience.So if you are like me and looking for a camera for your back yard this is probably not the best choice. In retrospect the floodlight is the product I needed for this purpose.However, if you need a camera for a door or a close proximity area this would be an excellent product. I plan on moving this to my front door in the near future and placing a floodlight in its place in the back.I haven't experienced any short battery life span, I have used about 50% in the last 30 days of high use.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2018"

1406,MamaMoe,Images show one design and you actually get another but got resolved,"  The design is NOT what is consistently shown. The primary connection, video unit to mounting connection, is from the top not the bottom of the back of the unit. The difference in design does matter, angles that the unit can cover are different, you can't tip it down as much. If you don't have to tip it down for your best angle then you're ok, but it won't work in the location I bought this to cover.UPDATE: OK, So after several emails with Ring, telling me I'd bought the wrong one (which I didn't) it turns out after you open the bottom end, with the sensor, you can slip off the case from the main body of the unit and turn it around so the mounting connection is how it is advertised as looking.  I changed the rating from one star to four, taking one off for having to deal with this issue.

1683,oscar miami fl,Not worth the price!,"  Very disappointed with the spot light battery cam.  I have the wired flood light security cam and it is awesome.  The spotlight battery cam does not let you pick the specific area you want monitored like the flood cam and doesn’t seem to be as sensitive.  Spot light will pick up every damn car that drives by even on low range but doesnt pick me up walking down my drive way to get the mail.Camera takes a still image initially upon motion detection but the photo is pretty low quality and usually over exposed making it pretty worthless.  If it’s someone walking through my yard by the time the live feed starts up that person is usually past the field of view.The battery on this thing lasts maybe two weeks at best.  Ordered a 2nd battery from amazon but is taking 3 weeks to be delivered.I wish the app had an option to control your cameras simultaneously.  You have to program the schedule for each separately which is a pain in the A.  Also one master switch to turn off notifications for multiple cameras would be nice.I’d highly recommend the flood light model, but these spot light cameras have less functionality and do not work as well.  For $200 I expect a lot more.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 16, 2018"

Camera comes with one lithium ion battery, but has two compartments if you choose to buy another battery.  So far I have 240 “events” with one battery installed (7 events per day average), and the battery is at 50% charge.  It’s been installed for 5 weeks.  I have this particular camera installed on my back patio. The good thing is that I can turn it on and off via the app on my phone or tablet.  Lights on the camera will easily illuminate a 15 X 15 area, if not moreRemember these cameras work via Wi-Fi.  99% of your problems, if any, are going to be router related.  If any of your Ring devices are located farther than 15/20 feet from your router you may  have issues. Tip - Get yourself a really good router.  I purchased a Netgear Nighthawk from Amazon. Forget the Chime Pro Wi-Fi extender that Ring sells. It won’t solve your problems.  Delay receiving alerts, video/audio quality, video lag, etc. are all going to be the problem of weak router.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2018"

It allows for virtually all the same functionality of the app.I have ended up getting 2 more cameras and solar panels to cover other areas of my property.

I do have a brick veneer, so NOW I am purchasing a 'Ring Door Bell Chime wifi Extender which will be plugged in about 5 feet from the camera and 12 feet from my Router. Because I opt for the solar panel option, at this point I'm WAY over 300$ invested in getting a single camera functional. If I put a camera on my front that would be closer to 25 - 30 feet away and I just can't see buying two wifi extenders. This is COMPLETELY ridiculous. Ring is ""supposed"" to be the defacto option for home camera security and the range is a complete and utter joke!!!!  LIKELY because RING want to save 25 cents a unit on not installing a REAL wifi transmitter / receiver!!!  FIX / IMPROVE YOUR STUFF RING!!! THIS IS A JOKE!!

2456,Tricia,"Good camera, but you're only as good as your app, which doesn't work. And the company doesn't appear to be honest.","  Good concept, too bad it doesn't work. Worse that the marketing on the website is lying. Customer service stated that the device is not actually compatible with Windows. Why there's a windows app, I have no idea. Regardless. Brand new camera, great wireless signal and speeds, all functions seem to work in the app except for the live feed. Not good when the product is a ""camera"". Anyways, the Ring app shows a black screen on both my phone and PC, and the app crashes in about 20 seconds after opening, every time. So it's pretty much worthless. I stumped customer service, they have no fix. I have no programs installed that are on their incompatibility list. I guess this thing is just not made for me. Best of luck out there! Looks like i'll be getting an Arlo or Nest. Will do some research. This product has a lot of R&D to do. Too bad, sounded great. Oh yea, 15 minute hold on customer service. Almost long enough for me to give up the call, but I hung on. Still, they were unhelpful with this issue. I kept getting placed on hold as it's obvious that my rep was new and didn't have much history, so she was asking around with ""anyone hear of this issue"", I'm sure.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2018"

When I do get a visual, it’s choppy and the sound is glitchy. I tried to troubleshoot with Ring support, but they basically told me they can’t help me because I’m not physically with the Ring device to do manual troubleshooting and they couldn’t do anything to help me remotely. The irony that this is what the device is for is too much!The Ring at my permanent residence (plug in) is better, but the app makes it terrible. I can never see the motion it alerts me to.

   I believed the commercials and purchased 4 ring products (3 spotlight cams Battery ""HD"" and 1 wired camera). That was quite an investment and I have had lots of trouble with them.The way I expected it to work (the way the commercial shows it working) is that the ring camera alerts you on your phone, you push a button and see what triggered the alarm (motion). However the reality is that about 60% of the time the cameras either don't display on the app / phone or they take so long that whatever triggered it has done what it wanted to do and is long gone (sometimes its 3 or 4 minutes). Ring help asks lots of questions about my wi-fi, however I have 180 Mbps and the ring camera I have the most trouble with is no more than 20 feet from my router, and my TV that streams 4K movies without interruption is 10 feet from my ring camera. My wi-fi is not the problem, their device is. There is also the issue of ""your battery is below 50% this may take a moment longer"" when you are trying to see what has triggered your camera, and only one of your batteries is below 50% the other one (in the same camera) is at full charge.Finally,  if and when you do get an image many times if there is motion in the image, the image pixilates so badly (the motion confuses it?) that you only see a blur and have no idea who it is or what they are doing. I will not mention the freezing of the video as well at times. Also I put ""HD"" in quotes because its nothing like high def. If a person is 25 feet away from the camera you can hardly tell their gender let alone who they are or what they look like.This is a novelty item only, don't rely on it for security. Its nice to be at work and see if a delivery is being dropped off at  your house from time to time. but if it only works  40% of the time, and many times takes forever to load an image... I don't call that security. It needs to be more like 99% reliable for me to think of this as a ""home security system"". I'm very sorry I spent the money I did on this product and would want to warn off anyone else looking into this system: it’s very expensive and very unreliable. With so many other systems on the market I would now look into other products that are more robust with better cameras and microphones ( another area that Ring disappoints is audio, obviously Avery cheap microphone in this very expensive product).Update: Ive has this system for almost a year and have no faith in it. It almost never works. I’m actually surprised when it does. It’s not my wi-fi which is excellent. It’s their cameras. I literally only rely on it for package delivery notice which works about 50% of the time. I had added a video of the typical response you get from an alarm ... which apparently was removed, the upshot of the video is: the little circle spins for 1:05 and then quits... you never get an image.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2018"

2673,James Ennis,Buyers beware. PLEASE READ before purchasing.,"  I REALLY wanted to like this video camera. But after 2 days of toiling with connectivity and unresponsiveness, I've decided to throw in the towel.I have a coworker who has owned the Ring doorbell camera for over a year now. He loves it. I've see the sensitivity of the motion sensor coupled with the picture quality. After a year of deliberating whether or not to make the purchase, I went for it.My front door is situated very precariously. The front of the house faces north. This includes the front door. However, the wall my existing doorbell is on faces west, directly to the left of the front door. The exterior wall for the garage space extends slightly farther than the front door does. I didn't build the house. I would have placed the doorbell to the right of the front door facing the same direction as everything else. But it is what it is.However, for the aforementioned reasons, I didn't buy the doorbell camera. I would have been very limited as far as motion detection and the cameras field of view were concerned. So after researching related products, I gravitated towards the Spotlight Camera with the Battery. It was wireless, and it was advertised the battery would last 6-12 months. First of all, let me say this is BULL CRAP! You will NEVER get 6 months out of that battery on a single charge. NEVER! After playing with the camera for 1 day trying to dial it in, I was down to 80% battery. That was in 1 day from a 100% charge. Granted I was using the camera more than the average person would use it in a single day, but nonetheless, their claim that this will last for 6-12 months on a single charge is FLAT OUT false advertisement.The camera has a slot for a 2nd battery. I ordered one BEFORE I discovered how much I loathed this device. I called Ring today to cancel my order. The gentleman on the phone told me that the order had been processed, but hadn't been shipped yet. He told me he can't stop the process now, but he would note my account so when I returned the item they would credit me back the money. Now I'll admit that $30 doesn't break the bank, but it just seems really odd to me that he couldn't stop the transaction and refund me my money..... But..... back to why I hate this device.So knowing my visual limitations with the position of the doorbell, I chose a nice location to the right of my door under the eve. It was located about 10' up. I have Cox broadband at my house and my average internet speed is 60 Mbps. But since my wireless router is on the opposing side of the house and on the 2nd floor, I installed a wireless range extender in the outlet closest to the wall/corner that I was hanging the camera. I knew for a long time before the purchase that I was going to be placing the camera where I had, so the range extended was installed months ago. I've had multiple devices linked up to it over those months to maintain/verify it's reliability. Through the extender I've averaged 25 Mbps down, and 6 Mbps up. It's never dropped out, and it's never fallen below those speeds. I guess what I'm trying to say is it's solid as a rock!So the set up for the ring is easy. The booklet coupled with the App walk you through the entire process. Even the technically challenged person can set this up. These are things that are very important to note that weren't explained to me during the set up, or in the instructions. You can invite several ""guests"" to ""share"" the network, but they don't have the same privilege level as the owner. This wasn't a deal breaker for me, but it wasn't something I knew until after purchasing the product. So the person ""sharing"" the network cannot erase events or tweak some features on the camera. Not too big of a deal.The sensitivity and features of this camera seem to have a mind of their own. Regarding the functionality, it works 15-20% of the time. I'm not kidding, and I'm not embellishing- 15-20% of the time. I will get notifications saying there is motion at the front of my house, and I will play back the 30 minute recording to discover a black screen with the pretty little ring logo in the left corner. No picture whatsoever. I've also gotten recordings where the frame is frozen on a still image, but the audio comes through. And don't even get me started on the ""Live View"" function of this camera. That might perhaps be one of the most technically frustrating features I've ever dealt with. It will work for you 1 out of ever 5 or 6 attempts. It will say ""Live View"", and make it seem like it's starting (as the camera backdrop never changes) with a fuzzy image of what your would expect to see. You can just make out that it's the backdrop you're used to seeing from the fixed view of the camera. Then you get that stupid buffering wheel that just hangs, and hangs, and hangs there until you finally get so frustrated you back out of the feature. Then you'll try it again. And the result will be different. Maybe you'll get to the live view, but you more than likely will get less further along than the first attempt.The picture is grainy! It's supposed to be 1080. Well, if the person was within 3 feet of the camera, the picture would be beautiful. But from 15' away it's just ok. You could make out details (clothes, colors, gender, race, animals, etc....), but not with absolute precision and accuracy like what I would expect from a true 1080 picture. And trust me..... I know picture quality. I work in Broadcast Video for a huge telecom company and I work with TRUE uncompressed, high definition broadcast video equipment. That being said, I'm also no slouch when it comes to my intellect. Admittedly I'm not the smartest guy in the world, but I can say with a measure of confidence I'm above the average. I KNOW I'm doing everything right on my end.Last night I experimented with the camera before and after sunset. Sometimes I could set the camera off with my motion, and sometimes I could not. I tried every possible combination of wait times to see if the camera needed a ""rest period"" between recordings. It didn't matter. At one point I even climbed up onto a planter box that allows me to perch myself within 2' of the camera. It STILL failed to trigger a response. Like I said, it has a mind of it's own.But the most troubling thing of all happened to me this morning. We have a huge coyote population in my neighborhood. They love to walk across my yard and leave me""'presents"" on my driveway and lawn- both of which are in the motion zone I set up for this camera. They are there EVERY NIGHT. So I expected to see motion activity on the camera when I got up this morning. But that isn't what I saw. I launched the app, then got a reply saying that there was an issue communicating with the camera. So I walked over to the range extender (remember- that is only 10' away from the camera on the inside of the wall) and discovered the link light for the device (the camera) was no longer green, but was amber, indicating no sync with any device. Apparently the ring camera decided to just drop off the network during the middle of the night, and not reconnect.So the reason I have this camera is because it's completely unreliable. It works when it wants to, but unfortunately that is less than 1/2 of the time. If you bought this camera, it was purchased as a means to safeguard your home and your family. You want it to work 100% of the time. And it SHOULD!So why do I think this is happening? Remember, I'm a tech guy. I deal with IP Ethernet, High Def Video, and packets of 1's and 0's all day long. I think the Ring company has bitten off more than they can chew. I believe their facilities that house their servers are inadequate to handle the traffic from the millions of Ring owners out there. The data hits a digital ""bottleneck"" and you get buffering. Servers can't be pressurized. You can't squeeze in more than what they're set up to handle. I also think that their data lines to communicate with the world are inadequate. Same concept as the servers. Too much traffic, too narrow a road. So it's my opinion that Ring really needs to step up their game and upgrade their layer 1 network.This morning I came and and shared my story with my coworkers- one of which was the gentleman that sold me on the Ring. He told me that he experiences the same issues I was talking about, specifically with the Live View. Then 2 other coworkers chimed in who are Ring owners. They also said they had issues. So there are 4 people in the room that own the Ring, and with 100% consistency we all experienced issues. This is a MAJOR PROBLEM!I'm returning the Ring and buying a competitive (slightly more expensive) camera system for my home. In my opinion, Ring is garbage! There are better options that are much more reliable. Remember why you're buying the system. You can't put a price on your family.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 23, 2018"
2674,Noe ulloa,Don't buy!,  This camera does not work as promised. The range for motion alerts is supposed to be 5-30 feet.  The camera sends a motion alert every time a car drives past the house and the street is about 60 feet from the camera.  I have the sensitivity set to the lowest setting.

2675,Jeremy Mabe,NOT FOR USE OUTDOORS - DO NOT BUY - NOT WATERPROOF OR RESISTANT,"  Ring has made a camera that is not meant for outdoor use. Yes, an outdoor security camera that does not work outside. Why? Well, it is not - in any way  AS PER RING - waterproof.It is *PERHAPS* water resistant, in theory. However, the first time it rained, after only having been up for a few days, the device sent an error message to us that water was inside and to check immediately. We went out in flood conditions to remove the camera, immediately after the warning.The camera already had LOTS of water in it. I've spent 13 days back and forth with Ring trying to work with them on fixing this. This was the SECOND unit I had purchased; the first had an obvious defect - the battery case would not close properly. Ring says NOT to purchase these items from Amazon, for the record.These are NOT meant for the outdoors. They are NOT water resistant, and are NOT supposed to be water proof. DO NOT USE A RING CAMERA if you might have ANY rain or moisture, at ALL.

If you aren't somewhat screwed in before popping the ball on the camera into the socket you cannot tighten the collar. Even if you are just barely screwed in, once you pop the ball in the screw will often pop out to be lost forever. Whoever engineered this did a bad job.

2681,Daniel p Hoffman,Working with Ring on solutions,"  **Update to review**Ring contacted me right away after leaving this review. Alicia worked with me to figure out why my cameras were acting the way they were. She took the time to review the camera angles, locations, settings, etc. We tweaked some things because the cameras still didn’t seem to catch when people would pull into our driveway. The majority of our issues were activities being missed at the front of the house and the driveway. They sent us a Chime Pro for free to try and help booster up the wifi signal to the front of the house. It’s hard to tell right now if it helped. They also sent a discount code to get a new camera on the other side of the garage to try and get better coverage on the driveway where we need it. We haven’t been able to install that yet because it’s been so cold outside. I will update this review once that’s up and running.If I could give Alicia 10 stars I would. She was simply amazing. Constantly followed up with me, made sure things were working, patient with troubleshooting, handed my case over to someone else while she was on vacation, super friendly and professional. Ring is lucky to have her and I got lucky to have her as my support Rep.We had 5 of these cameras installed outside when we had our unground pool put in. We spent a lot of money and to be honest, they’re terrible. For still videos they’re fine. For actually capturing things on video that matter, they suck.My mom fell THREE times at my front door -and all 3 times the camera skipped the entire fall. No exaggeration - it just so happened all 3 times the cameras (2 of them)  didn’t catch the falls. I swear I was convinced Ring monitors your videos and deletes it. Unreal. Then it happened AGAIN- Doordash driver hit my garage door and my 2 cameras conveniently didn’t capture her driving up to my house and INTO my driveway, no shots of her hitting the door BUT captured me walking out of my door when she called me to tell me she hit it. If it wasn’t for her calling me and feeling me, it would have been a HUGE MYSTERY. TWO cameras that should have caught it didn’t plus 3 falls from my mom that missed the entire fall - THREE TIMES.

2682,Justin Offutt,Died after two years / Pristine condition/ Ring didn’t care,"  First off, I have 10 Ring products (11 if you count the bridge).  All my outdoor Ring products are mounted under soffits and protected from the elements.  The Spotlight Cam looks as new as the day I unpacked it.  If I had a clue that a $200 security camera was going to crap out after two years of excellent care I would have never bought it.  I called Ring and after what seemed a long and tortuous runaround they said they would knock off a few bucks on the purchase of a new one!!  I politely declined.  Horrible service ...and they all but admitted their products have quality and longevity issues.  Also, the glaring weakness of the entire Ring ecosystem is the interminable lag time from when you hit the live button to when you can actually see the live camera feed.  By the time you see who is on your front porch that individual could have kicked in the door, stole all your valuables, made himself a sandwich, watched a couple episodes of Yellowstone, and nonchalantly sashayed out of the entranceway where your front door used to be attached to the hinges.  One more warning....the image quality at night ranges from adequate to abysmal.  I liked the idea of the Ring concept but I thought they would have eliminated the lag time by now and improved the night vision deficiencies.  And I never thought they would put out a piece of garbage like the Ring Spotlight Cam Battery.  Run from this product as if your life depends upon it.

2683,kris mclaughlin,Consider camera response time befor you buy this or any other system.,"  This is not so much a review of this camera but more a review of the Ring system in general. I purchased four cameras for outdoor use and generally they work very well but there are some things you need to be aware of.A. Response time. The cameras are advertised for the doorbell feature that is supposed to pick up the face of somebody at your front door or somebody stealing your Amazon packages. Response time is so slow that it usually only gets the back of the head of a person unless they stand there very still for a few moments.B. Reliability – the cameras do not pick up every event that happens. If the camera has been triggered it may not go off again the next time somebody walks in front of it. Nighttime reliability is much worse. We have had people walk up to the front door, knock on the door, moved to the kitchen window and yelled to see if were home, and then walk away. None of that event was captured by the front door camera.C. Arizona heat – the camera mounted in our carport is underneath the carport but we are told by Ring that the Arizona heat is so bad that it causes the camera to trigger during the day. It does this every 60 seconds. Ring did an update on the software and it has gotten much better nowD. Action notice response – on more than one occasion somebody has come up to the house and triggered an action notice on my cell phone. Occasionally I get the notice and before I can actually open it in time to talk to these people and do something about the event the people triggering the system have gone.  I do need to point out however that if you actually are able to see the people in the “live” mode the system works extremely well in allowing you to speak to them and hear them and it has a profound effect on people standing in front of your door.E. Overall based on the cost, the availability of solar power for the cameras, and ease-of-use I decided not to send this back. I just know that sometimes the system is not going to record events I really probably would like to know. Prior to this I had installed Arlo systems in the same locations I now have Ring devices. Arlo has the same response and reliability problems that Ring does and it does not come with the solar power option.So in the end if you need a highly reliable, wireless system you need to spend a lot more money on much higher quality components.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2018"
2684,Sandy Myrick,UPDATE: ***WASTE OF MONEY***STAY AWAY*** Not clear enough for faces and license plates,"  So, just got these up. I know it’s more of a “deterrent” than anything  but if the criminals or whatnot aren’t clearly captured on video to easily see the face or license plate, how will it stand up in court. The wifi is less than 20ft from both so that’s not the issue. Just like the newest Ring doorbell I have, not clear past 20ft for facial recognition. so how is an unclear picture or video gonna help convict trespassers and such? If there is no hard evidence, finger prints(rarely found or useable) or clear pics, they’ll just be let go to keep doing what they’re doing. Seen it plenty of times. I’ll see how they play out for a couple of weeks and return if I’m not 100% happy.UPDATE:Junk, waste of money. keep getting the ""battery door open"" message and it's not. there is no debris, wifi signal is strong. it would work ok for the first hour and then I can walk right by without them going off regardless of the settings. I will be returning these for a full refund and find something else. I am not going to keep going up and down a ladder dealing with this mess and neither should anyone else.

2685,Michael Harris ,WORTHLESS without a SUBSCRIPTION,"  I purchased 2 of these directly from the Ring website.  What isn't clear from their website or even the product description on Amazon is that you have to SUBSCRIBE after a 30 day trial in order to see your recorded motion events.As far as performance goes, I would say it's a bit glitchy especially for the price. There seems to be a delay sometimes where the motion isn't captured properly.  One of my cameras is positioned to have excellent signal strength from my wifi network whereas the 2nd one has a pretty weak signal, and yet both cameras are glitchy.I also have the Ring doorbell (I purchased all 3 devices at the same time) and that one has great signal strength and yet 9 times out of 10 if someone pushes the doorbell it doesn't notify me on the app until 3-5 minutes later.  Pretty worthless for a doorbell, in my opinion.I buy a lot of electronics and I don't mind spending a premium IF the product works.  But Ring is being deceptive in the way they market their product and the bait and switch is painful when you have to subscribe for a service just to use the product.I wish I had done more homework !",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2018"

Bought two stick up cams and they work great.  Got two spotlight cam battery units and while they work, they have issues, the most of which are the fault of the tech support people.  One camera died and I got an immediate replacement.  Wisely (?) invested in the Ring Protect Plus Plan and to date that has not been too smart because I can't even get the tech support to work with me on the extended warranty that comes with protect plus.  Was on the phone, ON A LADDER, working to factory reset my camera for 40 minutes, only to have the tech person tell me my WIFI was the reason the lights stopped working or went dim.  Uhmmm, what does the WIFI have to do with the brightness of my spotlights?  Camera picks up up great motion and quickly.

The battery doesn't hold a charge either. I purchased an extra battery and a Ring Solar Panel, but I still have to recharge at least one battery every week or so.

2689,Allyson White,Camera is great....mounting is HORRIBLE,"  This camera is great when paired with the large solar panel. I originally had this hooked up to the gutter mount and finally used the original mount kit to anchor and screew it to the fascia (sp?) of my house. After I screwed the mount in, I was wondering how the heck I was going to keep the camera attached to the mount with out it falling out. Low and behold that the little gray clasp with the screw was supposed to hold the camera onto the mount. Look at the picture I posted.....the mount BEARILY fits! When I was unscrewing the clasp, the tiny screw fell and I lost it in the grass. I looked in the package for extras but nothing was there so I used a screw of my own. This took me about 20 minutes (it felt like it) to try and jam a larger screw through the metal clasp holes where the smaller screw was. I finally got it through and it took forever to tighten it because the screw was too big, but that's all I had. When I finally was satisfied with the camera staying put, I tuned into my ring app to level the camera where I wanted it to record. The sucker popped right off the mount! How easy is it for someone to come steal this?! I had to improvise and wrap the bulb of the camera to the mount and clasp to prevent it from falling and being stolen.I love the ring cameras and this product would have received all 5 stars but the mount is horrible.

You'll get an error that says battery door open, then within a day, it's shot and will cease functioning completely.I called ring today, and told them it's an inferior design issue. I was told by a wonderful csr person that they are not waterproof, they're only water resistant. That they need to be set up under like an awning or some coverage. I said it kinda defeats the purpose of using it when you can only put it where there is an awning or something. She agreed, but she said that's why they are only marketed as water resistant and care needs to be exercised when placing the unit. I then said, that once again totally defeats the purpose of the camera if it can only be placed in an area that doesn't get wet. She agreed again. She said the only thing she can do is replace the unit free of charge,which I agreed to.Moral of the story, if you can't place this unit under cover, it'll become useless as soon as it gets a good rain.

Another point is the suggestion to initially install it ”near” the router! Excuse me? The camera HAS to be installed where it is NEEDED! A further suggestion to move the camera or relocate ones router if there are issues is simply beyond ridiculous. The router is initially placed by the installation technician and while not ”writ in stone” it's placement is guided by the locations of other devices on my homes entire network. It's not as I live on an extensive estate. My home is a double wide mobile home.

A pathetic meow that a baby kitten puts to shame. Two way communication is almost as bad. Testing with my wife as the intruder was a joke. Neither of us could hear the other! Motion detection is triggered by butterflies! Motion zone setting is with one device exception (iPhone) impossible to tailor to your specific setup.

2698,gary powers,Major software flaws in camera software logic,"                    The media could not be loaded.
                




   i have found two  major  logic flaws in the ring camera software. The camera stops recording after 30sec regardless if motion is still occurring. This has repeatedly caused the camera to miss critical security events. I have video to prove it. The customer should be to set the max record time regardless of the sensitivity setting.Also, if it stops recording because of the hard set limit it fails to start recording again if motion is still occurring. This is major design flaw in the software and puts customers at risk.See attached video.This has happened multiple times. I have complained multiple times yet ring refuses to fix either of the flaws.Their claims about battery life are based on this 30 sec cutoff. Until ring fixes this design flaw and allows customers to set reasonable recording time limits in minutes I would not recommend buying these cameras.They will put you and your property at risk because of the false sense of security that they are recording what happens.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2020"
2699,james ellison,RING CUSTOMER SERVICE was poor at first then improved greatly with review.,  I ordered and got a ring spotlight cam and it is defective.  Called customer service for technical support confirmed it was defective and not working properly so they are supposed to send a replacement.  Over a month later still no replacement and then they sent the wrong product replacement a stick up cam.  After over 2 hours on the phone verifying I actually owned a spot light camera and they were wrong in sending a stick up camera they are supposedly sending a replacement spot light camera.  I am so dissatisfied I asked for  refund and just return all of them but they would not process a refund.  Beware. I have spent at least 4 hours with their customer service thus far and still no functioning camera.After a poor review Ring customer service personally contacted me and corrected the problem.  The replacement camera is working properly and as expected.

After speaking with them they have since updated their website to better reflect the limits of the motion control on the battery powered SpotLight Cam.  They did stand-by the product (which as stated below, minus the motion zones, I was satisfied with) and wanted to correct the situation. Updated to more star as the camera is good now that it more accurately depicts how it functions and Customer Service making the effort to reach out and resolve the issue.******************************************************************Overall been satisfied with the spotlight battery camera. Battery life is adequate (def recommend buying second battery) and alerts are timely. My huge issue is the severe lack of ability to accurately set motion zones and frankly misleading/false images by RING. i live on busy road so cutting off road traffic was important. On rings website and advertisements it makes it look like you can adjust “zones” while seeing the image through the camera but this is not true. You must blindly guess where the large slices of the zones are and do LOTS of trial and error to correct. I spent 45 min on help line with RING to make sure I was not doing anything wrong before they confirmed their website was wrong. It has been over a month and website still shows the same misleading details which was disappointing to see.

2702,GShu,"Works well enough, battery door won’t latch shut","  I didn’t want to run electric or network cable to security cameras and we already had a ring doorbell.  Bought this model and it’s worked OK. I’ve gotten used to the fact that it doesn’t record all the time which is what I would want, but I understand that’s to extend battery life between charges and likely because Ring/Amazon does not want to pay for storage for ‘always on’ video.Battery life is good, we charge the battery every 6+ weeks.Takes too long for Live View to establish with the Ring app and takes too long to process video that in saved to the cloud but for the price and ease-of-install it’s workable.THAT SAID .. I just replaced the battery after charging for the fourth time. Battery door won’t stay shut. Falls open. It wasn’t easy to get the battery door to latch the first three times but now it just won’t catch at all.  I’m having to tape it shut. I googled and there seems to be a design issue.  Many people reporting the same issue. Kind of a problem as it’s an outdoor camera with elements to deal with. A $200 camera a few months old that has been handled with care shouldn’t need to have the battery door shut taped shut.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2020"
2703,AM,STAY AWAY!!!,"  I’ve spent about $800 on a few of the ring products, and I’ll never purchase an item from them again. Customer service is horrible. When faced with a fault product, you’ve got to spend an hour on the phone and fight to get a replacement. You’re best off to buy cameras that are wired.Any WiFi security cam is never going to produce the result of clarity as ones that you’ve got to run a cable. Also, wired cams are WAYYYYY CHEAPER, and you don’t have to pay for a service to review recorded footage. Majority of the wired cams also allow all the mobile software features such as alerts and notification. Now, my review on the quality.Product quality is absolute trash on this camera, and I’d never recommend this spotlight cam for many reasons. For one, the light is absolutely worthless on this camera. When the light kicks on from any motion, you cannot see anything!! There’s also no feature to disable the light. Secondly, this product —like majority of the ring cameras—is garbage. You cannot see anything clearly past 10ft and the night vision is horrible.Lastly, connection... all of the 4 ring products I have are plagued with connection issues, and this is not due to my internet speed. Trust me, I’ve got several products on WiFi that never encounter near the peak of problems that this camera’s have. You get kicked offline when viewing with random software app crashes, and half the time, you cannot connect to view live footage at all....Btw, if you play on mounting this product anywhere by the roof, be prepared to drill a 2” hole in your house (thank god I didn’t). Otherwise, the only option to plug this cam in is by exterior or extension cord—leaving the cable prone to be damaged by any future thieves.Since then, I’ve removed all of these spotlight cams. I’m not going to leave a bias product referral to another product, but I can tell you for the price you pay for two of these cams, you can get double your money’s worth with better quality products—better night vision, image, and distance zooming features—without paying monthly fees.  Running cables might seem like a headache, but it’s much more of headache using these cameras. Stick with cable. If you cannot do it, pay someone.Only feasible products from ring are the doorbell, and somewhat the spotlight. Even then, I’m about to replace those two.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2019"
2704,TX gal in the South,Does not record the actual event.  Too much latency,"  I purchased this with the solar charging option directly fron Ring.  The solar portion works great.  The camera portion is just about worthless.  The only recording that I get is several seconds after the motion event occurs.  Basically, what that means is that all I get is an AFTER EVENT recording.  Nothing of value.  I believe that is because it must connect with the network for each event.  I have a very fast secure network but it does take a few seconds to connect.  I think that there is a ""stay connected"" option but that, according to the vendor, drastically shortens the battery life.  So your choices are, no battery life, or no actual event recording.  It also won't connect for a ""Live View"" consistently.  Cell phone app just won't connect. PC app connects to a black screen.  Cancel and retry and I might get a connection on hte third or fourth attempt.  Yes, I did contact the vendor about htese issues and did not get a reply.  It has been over 3 months since submitting the problem report.  Overall, just not worth the money.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2018"
2705,Luke,"2 ways talk, and viewing things real time is absolutely worthless.","  Another update - The real-time use of the phone app and the Ring camera's is still spotty. Last night the mic didn't connect for 20 seconds, but the day before it connected right away.  I think some notifications showing the status of the connection process on the phone would be helpful. Otherwise you just sit and wait. But the app I noticed no longer times out, which is a HUGE improvement. We had to uninstall the phone app and install it again and this seemed to help. But the technology still needs work. I am improving the rating by one star. C'mon Ring, I know you can do it. You can get this app and the cameras to work 99% flawlessly.----------------------------------------------------------------I am updating this review because I just got off the phone with Ring and get excellent customer support. They are eager to resolve the issue. However, when they called, my system was working without ANY issue. Isn't that typical. We are going to keep an eye on things this weekend and when we have issues we will email our designated tech rep. Very cool. I do plan on sticking with our system because I believe they will work this out, and the system will only get better. We will see how things go, and I will adjust my rating accordingly.------------------------------------------------------------------We have spent about $800 on a Ring system from our home 3 cameras and a doorbell. Installation was easy and we were pretty excited to see it in action, and that is where this system absolutely bomb, to put it politely. I can't tell you how many times I have tried to respond to a camera picking up movement and I am unable to access the camera. I have submitted several reports to Ring so hopefully they are working on the system. When I do access the camera, it take soooooo long, including the doorbell, that whomever rang the bell would be gone by the time it comes up on my phone. I use the windows in my house to see who it is because it is faster. They should sell free window installments with the system.When I do connect, seriously after about 20 seconds minimum, none of the buttons on the phone app respond, and if they do it takes another 20 seconds. Any thief could steal the foundation to my home by the time I can yell, ""Get out of my yard"". About 50% of the time the phone app crashes, either before connecting or after connecting to the camera.I am not sure any other system would work better, so not willing to give another company a shot. I really think if they get this connectivity fixed it would be a great system.Here are some other facts: The Ring system is designed to work with the 2.4Ghz wireless connection because of the extended range, but my house is small, so I would like to try the 5Ghz range. But I cant! I have a new Nighthawk router/modem, top of the line. I have a Samsung J7 about 1 year old at most.I do not believe technology is the issue here. I really wish they would figure out the issues and fix the problems fast, because I do not really see how this system helps me in real-time response. I am keeping the system because I know it scares people off, and I can access the history of events, plus they have a cool community site to see what is going on in your community.Once Ring fixes the real-time connectivity to the cameras I will be glad to change this rating.Really frustrated and disappointed.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2019"

I liked the system a lot until I tried to get customer support! The person who set up my ring devices registered with an email address that he went in and changed where he was sole persons to access it or reset the email password then reset the “owner” ring password! And listed me as a user.  He would watch me and not relinquish control of the ring account and not give me the password and access to the email account!  I contacted Ring several times, each time telling the long story then I would start entering in any info they asked for specific information to get the email changed and password changed over so that I maintained control of my security.

(With subscription)7) Decent battery life. Offers room for a second battery. (Bought separately)8) WirelessMost security cameras have these features.The Bad1) purposely stops compatibility with my Google products. (Google usually make their products work with Amazon in my experience)2) Not very good customization. Most importantly, it limits your recording to 30 seconds. If someone is snooping around your house, by the time the person does something illegal the recording has already stopped.3) In my experience once a recording is done, it will wait some time (minutes) before it will work again. So still NOT going to record a intruder after the first 30 seconds by starting again.4) They have shown little care for privacy, as they are not very secure. Also they sell contracts to the police for user listings from what I have seen in the news. This may be good on the surface, buy I can see abuse happening in the future. This information can be found in many online news articles. Who else are they selling you too?5) They are bulky and ugly. This is not a big deal to me, but worth noting.6) to save clips online a subscription is required. Without a subscription I believe it gives notifications and live feed only.7) Can't save to my own storage vs paying a subscription. There is no reason they could not be programmed too. Like most companies they want to charge you for ever if they can.I new almost all these things before buying.8) Need to buy a second battery for the better battery life.So I am generally accepting of them except those I was unaware of, and that should be changed.1) Only 30 second clips. Let me choose! I am paying for the subscription after all.Unwilling to work with competitor products (Google). This makes for a much poorer experience. For example it would be nice to display camera feed to a Google display or Android TV. I'm not going replace all my other equipment. I am likely to dish Amazon Ring in the future instead.3) Lack of privacy. That's why I only have an out door camera. And will only get internal cameras to face the door only.All in all obviously a mixed bag. That being said I have enjoyed it. If I had longer than30 second clips and Google support I would likely have given 5 stars.Hope this helps to inform.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2020"

I keep being told someone will contact me....NO ONE ever gets back to me! I have them try to blame my wifi yet no other devices have issues and the camera that is farthest from my wifi router (my doorbell) has the least issues.

My internet wifi speeds have been tested often and while I pay for gigabit speeds I am usually clocking around 300-400gbps at my cameras....PLENTY fast enough for these things to work. After numerous attempts to make this right, I finally give up! I am done wasting hours of my time trying to get ring to solve my issue or offer to replace these cameras with ones that work.

Beware if the solar panel, a few cloudy days and your batteries are dead. Ring does not have a power extension, and wont sanction or approve 3rd party power extensions. I am changing batteries every 2 months, due a lot of false alerts. the camera needed an attached external antenna, which would help connectivity issues. The basic camera mount is useless and has limited capability, causing the camera to dislarge. You have to buy another mounr to fix this issue. Closing the battery case can be a challenge at times.

Even with speed tests of 50 Mbps up and 48 Mbps down with 0% packet loss at camera location, it still says there is poor wifi and very inconsistent connections (especially live view which regularly results in black screen).A big issue is the statements about battery life. With only 3-4 motion events captured the battery drains about 10% in a day. There's no way I'll get even one month of life from this unless it never goes off. Will be a pain to keep things charged.For reference my neighbor uses a different brand and his batteries lasted 6+ months no problems with pretty regular captures throughout the day.Update:After having it up for a little while now, also noticed it is really prone to false alarms. Since standard setting only picks up stuff very X minutes, means things can get missed. The smallest breeze causes it to fire off, guessing because there's bushes at front of house that sway around. This means I have to reduce motion zone which makes it useless.They need to do a better job differentiating real events versus breezes. At the same time it completely missed the wife and I walking right through our front door and the camera was pointed right at it not that far aware.

2715,fredi Guardado,An all around good camera system.,"  I have been back and forth in getting cameras for our home for a while. We had family get someof the ring system and was impressed by the quality. When we moved to our new house, we had some of our kids toys stolen from the front yard the first day we were here and that made the decision to get a system.I was between Ring and Blink. When comparing several videos and taking into account not just image quality but the larger field of view with ring, that pushed me toward ring. When I saw that ring had a stolen camera replacement policy (I mean, it’s not that hard to pop the spotlight cam out of the mount if you really want it) that cinched the deal.Installation was easier than I expected, but both of my ring spotlight cameras went into wood. Each has a mount with a ball in socket connection that is tightened with an included torx type bit while the mounting screws (4 for each camera) are Phillips (also included bit).The spotlight camera has capacity for two batteries, and comes with one battery. My family with a ring system recommended to fill both bays so I bought an extra battery for each camera so when the battery dies, the camera can run off the spare while the primary charges (approximately 10-12 hour charge time on a 1 A charge).They do push the ring subscription but is not required. I went ahead and bit since it was $100 for the whole year and it extends your warranty as long as you have the subscription.Setup in the Ring app was simple. Start it up and follow the prompts. It wasn’t an issue for us, but when planning hour camera placement, make sure your WiFi strength is stout wherever you want to place them.They do tend to have a little bit of a “boy who cried wolf” feel with how many alerts I get but I know I’m still in the trial and error part of setting the sensitivity and don’t hold this against the system. I do with the battery version let you trace out the tracking area like the hard wired versions.Overall, it’s a good system that is relatively simple to set up with good video quality, field of view, and relatively affordable premium subscription level.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2019"

I don't mind charging it every few weeks.  However, it seems overpriced at $200.  This is a great camera that can be mounted anywhere within a wifi access point, but $200 for a single camera is steep.  Amazon runs sales where you can get the camera around $150 which seems like a reasonable price for what you get.  You may be able to get a decent used or refurbished one for even less.  I would wait for those opportunities and not pay full price.One tip for those not receiving motion notifications.

2719,Carla,Great camera. Get the solar panel and raise your router,"  I received the Ring Spotlight Camera for Christmas this year, to complement the Ring doorbell Pro I put in last year  and like very much. I wasn't even sure I wanted the video doorbell at first but it's so handy and satisfying to be able to keep track of what's going on around the house that it seems like a no-brainer now.  This Ring cam is every bit as good --  a well-constructed device that's easy to install, comes with good, clear instructions , a solid mount, and a powerful app backing it up.My installationI put the camera under the eaves, near the center of the garage door to capture the driveway, mailbox, and a good chunk of the front yard. Ring recommends keeping it out of direct rain and frankly that just seems like the smart way to go whenever you can.  The lens angle is a super-wide, ""fisheye"" type and captures a broad area. I installed the Ring solar panel because I didn't want to worry about battery life. The mount is easy to deal with (just a couple of screws, included) and is very secure once you tighten down a collar holding the ball coming off the camera into the socket on the mount. The solar panel is mounted on the outside trim of the roof because unlike the camera, it needs full exposure. It's oriented east (South is best for solar panels in this hemisphere) but keeps the battery at 100%.ProsConstructionBuild quality is strong. This is a heavy piece for its size. The lens is of a good size and the case is solid. I dropped it once during installation from several feet above a concrete driveway, and it came away with just a small scuff. All the packing materials, cords, etc. have a heavy-duty, premium feel to them.Image qualityThe view from the camera is clear and sharp with bright, saturated colors in good light. It doesn't have tremendous resolution at distance (I don't think you could identify a face at the mailbox 40 feet away, for example) but it looks good. Nightvision is black and white unless the light comes on, but is also of good clarity for a modern security camera. I have a separate motion detector light mounted nearby that helps it ""see"" in color as well (not a security nut; just had the other light there first).Motion DetectionWorks well, but motion detection is tricky to tune if you have a street-facing camera and don't want 10 million notifications. Ring has some tweaks for turning it ""down"" and modifying the areas it monitors, but having lost two mailboxes to careless drivers, I want to see the street. I just let it record every car that goes by , but we live on a quiet cul-de-sac. You may want to ""de-tune"" motion detection more if your camera faces a busy street.RecordingSpeaking of which, Ring does make you pay if you want to keep recordings of  motion-detected ""events."" $30/yr per device, or $100 for unlimited devices. I'm paying the $60 for two devices and I'm okay with that. If you ever actually need a security camera for ... security ... you'll want a record. You can scan through the recorded events to see what's going on generally, or just ignore them. I do like to check as to anyone passing by the house between say, midnight and 5 a.m., and the timestamps allow checking just those (nothing of note so far besides the landscaping guy down the street starting his day in the middle of the night and the neighbor's kid cutting through the yard for whatever high schoolers are doing at 4 a.m. these days).The Ring appI'm sure people have legitimate gripes about the app (because, apps) but overall it's powerful and user friendly.  Linking my doorbell cam, the garage/front yard cam, and a few Ring pathlights makes for a convenient way to check everything going on around the house. Ring gives live updates when there's any kind of known issue. The ""device health"" and wifi testing features have been helpful in getting my setup dialed in correctly. The ""Neighbors"" feature, which has received some criticism for potential abuse by law enforcement  (they still need permission to view your footage) is  actually good to have in my opinion.  People post footage from any local shenanigans, which you can track by location, and the occasional lost/found dog. It has also been educational seeing what some people find alarming, such as a teenager with a clipboard coming to the door in the middle of the day.The light is good for the immediate areaIt's plenty bright, but doesn't have a lot of ""throw"" over distance (despite the name, this is not the model with the big spotlights on it). It's enough to light up the area directly in front of it in the driveway. Good enough to let someone know there's a camera present and to see your way around a few yards.Ring Solar Panel compatibilityThis is not a review of the solar panel, but being able to keep the battery charged indefinitely is a huge plus. Simple to install; looks and works greatConsYour wifi mileage may vary, and sometimes going to the ""live"" feed  takes a long time, so much so that Ring has a whole separate app that's supposed to allow you faster access. That tells me it may be something in Ring's system that slows delivery. However, the app leads you through tips to speed things up, and what finally worked for me was raising my wifi router up about 2 inches by setting it on a book. I wish the mount allowed the camera to angle a bit more, particularly up and down. I wish recordings were free and the devices were less expensive, and a new update puts a ""siren"" button a little prominently on the the home page (not something you want to hit inadvertently) but overall this camera does what I wanted: I can see what's going on around the outside of the house at all times, from anywhere. Obviously nice for security, but it's even handy to meet someone coming to the door before the dogs go bananas.Tips:1. Get the solar panel, and make sure the single battery (it's all you need with the panel)  is installed in the left slot (the app will tell you which slot holds the battery to clarify) As near as I can tell, that's the only one that receives solar charging. Half a day in the ""right"" slot got zero charge, whereas it charged up to 100% from 60 or so in just a couple of hours with the battery on the left.2. If you're having connectivity issues, first try just raising the physical height of your wifi router before worrying about fancy fixes like a wifi extender. It may sound silly, but nothing, including moving the Ring hub all over the place, helped like raising my router two inches by putting it on a book. High tech camera, meet the power of the printing press.3. Multiple devices combined with the app really make this system shine. Open the app and see what's going on with the front porch from the doorbell cam, and whatever exterior views you have covered otherwise.  Check to see where your dogs are by way of the motion-sensing pathlights. The Ring system makes it  simple to combine your views and link the products together.Five stars.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2020"
2720,JAFFAR AHMED,Frustrating and inconsistent,"  After nearly two years of owning this camera, we're ready to throw in the towel. The whole point of a security camera is that it's supposed to work on those rare instances when you need it to. It's very hard to get the motion sensitivity to the right level and it goes off constantly at the slightest movement, even after tweaking the zones to practically two feet away from the camera, which is of course useless from a security point of view.The worst is accessing Live View: it's maddeningly inconsistent and frustratingly out-of-order precisely when you need it most (i.e. when motion has been detected and you're trying to see what's up: who's at your door or on your property). The error message ""Having trouble accessing Live View"" is all too common, and if you try to click ""More Info"" you're directed to a useless support page that shows nothing about how to address or troubleshoot the problem. It's definitely not our wifi or battery life (we have the solar battery panel too) or connectivity issues on our end, as sometimes it works fine but more often than not it doesn't. Calling customer service is a joke and wastes endless time, with no resolution—probably because the simple plain fact is that this product just doesn't work well. This camera is not worth the money or trouble, nor does it reliably perform the functions a security camera should. Look elsewhere.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2021"
2721,daniel serrano,So much better!,"  July 2020 updated review:A few months ago, I noticed ring updated their software so there wouldn’t be so much of a lapse in time between videos when there is still motion in the zone. One video ends, and the next video picks up almost right away. I’m now very happy with my camera!June 2019 review:I bought two of these spotlight cameras in November from Home Depot, so that’s why this isn’t a verified purchase review....wanted to preface with that.These are “okay” cameras. I don’t have anything to compare it to, but I was hoping, for the price, that I would get more than 30 seconds of recording time. I have a lot of squirrels and birds hanging around my yard, so it would be nice if there was a way to tell the camera to only record things bigger than those. We have a home security system that senses large objects when our alarm is set to “away”, so I know the capabilities are out there, but maybe these cameras don’t have that same capability.At any rate, 30 seconds of recording time is next to nothing, and sometimes the camera doesn’t even pick up movement until the delivery person has already dropped my package and is on their way back to their vehicle. I also find the time for the recording to pick back up a really long time. Like others have said, anything could happen in that amount of time.The battery life also leaves a lot to be desired. I have my motion frequency set to “light”, and the battery dies anywhere between 3 and 7 weeks, depending on the amount of squirrel activity in my yard.As far as the night vision, I wouldn’t really call it night vision. It’s a light on the bottom of the camera that turns on (pretty bright light, I will say) when motion is detected. That’s about it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2019"
2722,Richard A. Hammond,6 cameras now. All dead. Redemption?,"  Update: 06/02/2020: I've had it with these cameras. The thing only connects about 10% of the tries. Our WiFi is strong, but the battery camera just refuses to connect. The other two cameras, the wired spotlight cam and the doorbell camera, take a good 45-90 seconds before they'll show an image. What good is a doorbell camera that takes so long to load that most people have walked away, or it's just easier to go answer the damn door? Waste of money. Waste of time. Can't wait for Wyze to release their outdoor and doorbell cameras. I have 6 of the originals, including some outside, and they have literally never failed, and they're under 50 bucks. Ring is a joke!I have this camera and the doorbell 2. I have gone through 3 doorbells and now am into the 3rd camera. Not because I like them, but because they keep breaking.Ring cannot explain it and have no idea what's causing it, so the solution is just to keep sending me replacements. Batteries are fine, but for some reason the cameras just go unresponsive no matter what. Trying to factory reset them does nothing as they are completely bricked.So very disappointing considering that if you Google the best security cameras Ring is consistently in the top, and affordable compared to some competitors.Edit: 4/30/19 installed the third replacement camera. Lasted 4 HOURS before dying. Batteries are still full. What a joke. My $25 Wyze camera has been working flawlessly outdoors in a protective case for awhile, yet this $200 lemon won't? WTH?Update: 05/28/19A couple weeks ago, after my review, Alexis from Ring reached out and said they were willing to send me either a replacement spotlight cam solar or stick up cam solar. I elected the former. To make a long story short, they figured out that my wifi was on a new standard, 802.11r, or Fast Roaming. They'd somehow determined that the chipset in the camera was damaged or malfunctioning when fast roaming was enabled and asked that I disable it and give the camera another chance. I did so and it has been working without issue.I upped my review from 1 star to 3 stars because their customer service is excellent and personal. I left it at 3 stars because for a piece of hardware to be damaged or bricked because of a wifi standard seems pretty crazy. Knowing the problem though I imagine they are already working on an update or a change in the hardware.All in all, I'm very satisfied with how Ring handled it and their products are not working fine.Update 9/7/19: these cameras are good but the overall system is lacking. If you want cameras just to record videos for later, this is perfect, but I get motion alerts and it takes so damn long to load live view whatever caused the motion is long gone. If I want to see the event I have to wait until it's done rendering and go back to the recording. Same with the doorbell. Someone will ring the bell and it takes so long to open live stream they've either left or it's just easier to go to the door and look through the peephole. For the money, they don't work that well.And it's not the wifi. We have an Orbi mesh system and get over 600 mbps",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2019"
2723,Ivan Rodriguez,Not reliable and frustrating software for everyday functions,"  I purchased a ring door bell and two stick up cams, (plug in) Everything installed fine and the software is easy enough to get everything set up on your smarter devices. But then when it comes to actual function, I became very dissatisfied. The ring door bell works good. It was the most reliable item. I’m happy with that. When I set it up with our Alexa, I was happy how it worked with the door bell and motion alerts. It made me go ahead and purchase the two stick up cams. They were the start of nightmares. They false a lot. When there is motion, the motion is usually gone before the video had started recording, and I only get to see that 50% of the time, as the other times the little icon just spins until it comes up telling me to retry to connect. It kept showing me weak signal. I have a large house, but a pretty new router. We have no issues with our smart devices. I did have an older extender, so I replaced it with a very nice Netgear extender. Our WiFi was now great with our smart devices on streaming, but saw no change in the cameras. I then purchased the chime pro so the door bell could be heard easily and see if that would help with the signal. Nope, the device manager in the software shows weak signals on one camera from one day to another. The reaction time doesn’t seem to improve or worsen when it says it has a weak signal or good signal. I wanted to be able to hear the doorbell out on our patio, so I purchased another pro chime and was hoping it would help the backyard camera. No luck on the reaction time, but I do always show a good signal now. But that created another issue, I now get two alerts every time there is motion. They are back to back alerts, and I get them 12-15 times a day when it is windy. That brings me to another sore subject. The alerts. I cannot believe Ring made such poor software to manage the devices. When it is windy and I want to turn the motion alerts off for that camera, I then found out that the alerts only turn off on the device you turn it off on. Not the camera itself. So I can turn my phone off, but my wife still gets them and both of our alexa’s. On windy days, it is quit annoying. I have to actual turn the voice off on the alexa’s to stop those. I’m sorry, but I think that is pretty simple functions to add to software. I have checked my devices on the app and there is nothing showing me it should be sending double alerts. It started when I added the chime pro on the back patio, but I have that device set to do nothing on any alerts on motion. Don’t know what else I can do. Another annoying problem I have just started experiencing. I have had the system installed for over a month now and the free 30 day trial has run out. So if the motion alerts do not load immediately and I get the reconnect message, it then tells me I have no saved video when it does connect because I haven’t purchased that plan. It’s funny how that this problem has increased since the 30 day trial ran out. I had planned on purchasing at least the $3.00 a month plan, but I feel I have invested enough into Ring to keep going.The Ring company has proven they are not putting in the effort to make this the greatest product of this type. I read the community blog, and its one thing after another like I have dealt with. I had thought about increasing my home security to the Ring security system, but no chance now. There is just way too much lack of reliability. I feel I have give this product a fair shot and time. It’s not a great amount of money, but I have invested money and time on several ring products. It has been over a month now since I installed it.I have put a lot of time into trying to work the bugs out and make sure it wasn’t operator error. A lot of reading in the Community blog. That just frustrates me more. I do not recommend the cameras from Ring. My next plan is to see what security cameras and software work with Alexa. I like that feature, I just want to be able to control the alerts from the cameras themselves so all the devices are getting the same adjustments.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2020"

2725,Jessie,"Loading, Can't Connect, Dead Battery, Incomplete clips","  I don't love this product. It ""gets the job done"", so to speak, but it is really lacking in a lot of areas -1. I use the battery-powered version and I live on a city street where people are walking past a decent amount. So it's probably triggered on about 20-30 times a day. The battery lasts about a week. I had to buy a backup battery and now it still only lasts about 2-3 weeks and the batteries take about a day to charge. They also aren't super cheap.2. The clips are so short. They only run for like 15-20 seconds and I checked all of the settings. So if someone is messing around outside of your house, you won't get continuous footage. I get why this kinda makes sense, but it's frustrating nonetheless. Maybe an alert to say ""we've been recording for 2 minutes, want us to stop?"" would make sense.3. Connecting to my camera live is a nightmare. If someone is knocking at the door and my dog is barking, I'll try to get a live view to see who it is. The app takes at least 20-30 seconds to connect to the live view and even then sometimes it says connection failed. So I'll have to exit the app and open it up again and restart the load. By then, my estranged family members have already broken into my house.4. As a front door view, this angle isn't the best. I know that's my fault and I could have bought a standard doorbell, but just a heads up that this doesn't work best for above the front door because you can't see faces.5. The motion detection sucks. I know there's intentional pauses between motion to preserve battery life. Even with taking them off, it always misses the one thing I'm looking for or cuts off too soon.6. The storage system. So it's cool that you can get unlimited storage...but it costs $3 a month. Which isn't so bad, but it increases to $10 a month if you have multiple cameras. That's a lot. I don't need my clips stored indefinitely. How about an option for just a month retention rate that is cheaper?Pros - the quality of the image is stellar.

The camera is mounted at recommended height (8', with a slight tilt down). on a good day I am getting about 10' of detection. In my case this means someone can enter the gate, pass two vulnerable windows, before this camera will detect motion.

To create the motion zones -- I have to go to one menu and activate it.  then I have to go to another menu and define it.  Are you kidding me?  Why not make it a fluid process with everything on one page, or a workflow where one leads to the other?  I can't define motion sensitivity per zone.  Are you kidding me?  I have cameras that are almost 8 years old that have this capability to assign the same level of rights, to define different sensitivity to different motion zones.

2734,Lisa stephenson,Overall good but let down by a couple of quirks.,"  Only having a 5 star system here, I can only really give it 3 stars, though I'd up it to 3 1/2 if that were possible - it's solid, but does have a couple of quirks.  The first being that the motion sensitivity adjustment is VERY off based on the screen it shows you when you are adjusting it.  I have a long (30 ft) driveway.  When I first adjusted the motion sensitivity, I excluded the street area as I did not want an alert every time a car went up the street, but, regardless of the setting, I still got one.  Every... single... car.  So, I pulled it back a bit.  Same result.  More - same.  According to the adjustment screen, I have pulled sensitivity back HALFWAY down my driveway now, and I still will get an alert when a car drives past my house (often).  This will of course, greatly shorten battery life.The other quirt is WiFi antennae strength.  It's not as strong as some other similar devices I've tried.  It's stronger than their doorbell cams, but not as much as other branded battery cameras I've tried.The video quality is ok - not quite ""clear 1080p"" ok, but still better than average.  The lights are not super bright but give off enough given what the device is.  The app is easy enough to maneuver around.  But due to the very ineffective motion sensing controls, I'd have to say this would be good more for back yard/door observations, side yards, etc. rather than a front driveway if you have a decent amount of traffic that's going to pass by all day.  They need to work on that - if the mapping diagram shows it will only pick up motion to point ""A"" but it extends to point ""B"" no matter what you do, it becomes so irritating you're tempted the turn it off - and then what's the point of having it?",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2019"

2736,IJ,Problems within first few hours,"  I was initially going to go with a cheaper camera that had good reviews, but after comparing specs in a brick and mortar store, I decided to pony up the extra cash for the Ring Spotlight Battery, mostly for the two-way audio and solar charging option. Set up was easy enough. I got the app installed and connected the Ring to my WiFi, tested everything and then picked a spot and did the quick physical installation. The camera worked fine from about 1:30 p.m. to 6:15 p.m. I got notifications from some people walking up the street in front of my house and a few cars going by, which is fine for me.There were a few small flaws that bugged me initially. First, the battery compartment latch feels cheep and you really have to make sure you have it closed. Then around 4:30 I got a video where a guy on a dirt bike appeared to just freeze in the middle of the street for a few seconds before vanishing. Unless my neighbor has magical powers, the recording clearly had a gap in it even though the timer kept running.I left my house at 5:45, and the camera kept working for about half an hour. I got three more notifications during that time, but then I didn't get anything else. When I got home at 7, I didn't get a notification when I drove in front of my house. I tried walking in front of the camera. Nothing happened. I tried turning the light on and activating live view through the app. Neither worked, and it said there was a failure to connect to the camera.I went through the troubleshooting suggestions, but my app continued telling me my camera was online even when my router was resetting and it couldn't have been online. I tried pushing the button on the top of the camera as suggested and then pushed it again after 10 seconds. That didn't work either. I finally had to take the camera down and remove the battery. Remarkably, even with the battery out of the camera, the app still said the camera was online.After putting the battery back in, it looked like it still wasn't going to work, but about a minute later the lights suddenly came on and the app finally connected again. I put it back up, and it's been working since then. The app is showing it receives a strong WiFi signal, and the battery is still almost fully charged, so I don't think either of those were factors. I didn't have any sleep mode or motion detection rules set either.While the video quality is good and I like the interface of the app, I'm going to have a hard time justifying the price I paid for a security camera that is already having reliability issues in the first few hours of use.

The work great in every way, my biggest complaint as a installer and tester is, the mobility, or lack of.  They do not move left and right, up and down very well. If you mount the under a soffit, it needs to be clear of downspouts, trees, and bushes.  The solar panel does a great job, keeping the batteries charge.  But you must make sure that the batteries are fully charged before installing them.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2020"
2738,Michael Williams,Unreliable,"  I have other Ring products that work fine however I do not recommend the spotlight cam, particularly the battery version. First, the light will trigger for events that happen outside the configured motion zone. However when checking the app there is no motion event. This means that if your camera is anywhere near a street passing cars will cause the light to trigger on and off continuously. No amount of tweaking the motion zones change the light problem. The constant on and off uses up about 50% of the battery per night. Also motion detection is extremely weak. Even on the most sensitive settings, which also drain the battery faster, only about 50% of the motion is detected.  I finally decided, for the cost, this camera isn’t worth the hassle and returned it.  I have no problems with wired products so maybe these problems are specific to battery.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 24, 2021"
2739,Karen Anderson,Wouldn't buy again,"  I bought these off of Newegg.  Honestly, don't think I'd recommend them.  A few concerns:Pros:- Easy to set up, requiring no electrical set up and very simple to install especially if you have a power drill.Cons:- Battery life:  They say 6 month battery.  After only 3 days, I'm already at 66% battery life (fully charged before installing)- Motion detection:  It only detects motion in the bottom half of the screen, and doesn't consistently do so.  All morning, I've been notified every time birds have flown past the camera. BUT there has been a worker doing some window installation in the back that hasn't set off the motion alert one time.- Live view:  Quite glitchy.  It often takes a long time to load, and sometimes doesn't load at all.  If someone were to be stealing a package off of my porch, I think they'd be long gone before I even have a chance to open the app, load the live view, and set off the siren.I spent hours with two separate associates from Ring over the phone who at the end basically shrugged their shoulders and said these are just limitations with the device.EDIT: Ring contacted me to help fix the problem.  Ultimately, this does not change my review - they were not able to improve the performance of the products, and noted that these battery power devices are fundamentally different than the plug-in models of the same name, and have fewer sensitivity and motion-detecting options.  I did end up buying solar panels to power the devices (at my own cost), but ultimately,  I still would not re-purchase these cameras if I were starting again from scratch.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2020"

Alexis was wonderful in working diligently to solve the battery life problem. Now a 5 star review but going to leave initial review in place so if anyone has same issues they can see that a fix is possible.The Good: Ability to place anywhere on house or property without a power source being nearby is great. 2 way comms and the siren feature are invaluable. Installation and setup is fairly easy. The Ring app is better than most of its ilk.The Bad:  Motion sensors are TOO good. Takes great patience to set the zones up. blowing leaves, loud vehicles, etc. cause false alarms at an alarming rate! UPDATE...PLAY WITH SENSOR APP TO FINE TUNE.The Ugly: Battery life sucks. Even with 2 batteries installed, motion zones minimal, very few live look ins, lights off and alerts set to minimum I have been getting less than 30 days of service.

2741,Sarah DeLaughter,"Good device, poor customer service.","  Ring is not the company it used to be. When they first came out with the doorbell I was one of the early adopters - long before many folks even knew what they were. I now have several devices, including the stick up camera, which I really like.I recently had packages stolen and my ring doorbell didn't catch enough information for the police. So I installed the stick up camera, which has a nice bright motion sensing light. The other night, wanna-be thieves were deterred when the light came up (clear video of them creeping up to the porch and then backing off).I figured I'd post my video on the neighborhood app to alert my community. Only Ring customer support keeps deleting it. When I asked them why, I received a generic email about not following guidelines. I've since tried 8 times to post the video, with different accounts of the incident and I get the same non-specific answer from customer support as to why they deleted it.Earlier I purchased a ring chime pro, which sat in pending status on their order page. Only after receiving more generic emails about shipping policies and finally getting someone on the phone after waiting on hold for 40 minutes, was I able to escalate the delivery.In short, buy for the hardware, not the customer support or community features.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2020"
2742,jpizano,NOT that easy to install . . .,"  I was going on vacation and after the easy installation of the Ring Door View Cam and a a chime, I thought I'd also install a Spotlight Camera on my back door.  Easier said than done.I bought a 2 pack from Best Buy, because I couldn't wait for an Amazon Prime delivery.  Got it when the store opened and went straight home to install it.  I already had a charged extra battery for the Door View Cam, so I was ready to go but despite my best efforts, the Spotlight Cam failed to set up properly after trying both cams..  I finally broke down and called Ring Customer service.  Was told to turn off my wireless printer and reset the router but the cam would still not set up.  Was told to try the other cam (which I had already tried before) and then all of a sudden the cam did in fact go thru the setup procedure and I have a live cam view from it and signed off w/Ring CS.But not so fast . . . LOL!I got a ""low signal"" notice because the cam was only operating on the 2.4Ghz band from my router and not the extender.  So, I stupidly tried to change the wi-fi network used and totally lost connection w/the Spotlight Cam.  Aghhh!!!Had to do some errands, so then I went out, did them and tried to reinstall the Spotlight cam on my return, which required me to ""remove"" the spotlight cam and attempt to reinstall it.  Took forever but it finally took but I'm NOT touching it again!!!A couple of things they don't tell you in the install process:1) When the Spotlight cam is trying to link w/your wireless network it will ""create"" a wireless called ""Ring .  .  . Net access while the light in your Spotlight cam is ""blinking.""  Don't worry about the ""no Net access.""  The blinking means that the Spotlight cam is pairing w/your network and it needs to be left alone to complete the process.  I made the mistake of interrupting this process a couple of times, which is what made (to some degree) the installation problematic.  When it's done it will ask you which wi-fi connection the device should use and then take you thru a basic set up procedure, which you can change later.2)  If you have a stucco exterior on your house, like I do, the drill bit that comes w/the kit is worthless for drilling thru it.  I had to pull out my IMPACT DRILL and use a 4/64"" (1/4"") carbide impact drill bit (it comes w/a 5/16"" non-carbide bit) in order to drill a hole thur the stucco so that I could mount the bracket for the Spotlight Cam on the exterior wall.Who else has an impact drill handy?  Not many people, I suspect.  So, if you'd got a stucco exterior, be warned!!3)  Lastly, the Spotlight Cam is supposed to include a siren (which is does) but none of the materials that came w/the cam indicated how that can be accessed/used.  I  called Ring CS again and they told me to bring up a live cam pic, which I did.  There is a + sign in the lower right hand corner of the live cam live.  Touch that icon and 3 additional icons come up: a) an exclamation point (that's the alarm), b) a light (that's the light) and c) a small pic w/3 heads, which is the link to ""share"" the video w/your neighbors.  In order to activate the alarm, just press the ! icon.I thought that it would only take an hour to install the  Spotlight Cam but w/the problems w/the software installation and with the physical installation of the bracket for the cam, it took closer to 4.  Again, be forewared.The Spotlight Cam is NOT that easy to install.In any event, everything ""seems"" to work but I'm not so sure about the motion detection. The live cam works, the lights and alarm works (when activated),  The mic to speak and listen both also seem to work.  But, when I jumped up and down in front of the cam, I never got a motion alert and the lights didn't go on as (as they should have based on how I set it up.  However, I did get a couple of random motion alerts after I finished installing the cam on the wall.  So, I'm not sure what is going on.Later learned, after speaking w/Ring CS again, that the lights only go on when it's dark (duh!!).  So, I still have to check to see if the motion detector and lights work when it's dark.  The only reason I can think of (and Ring CS didn't know any better) why the motion detector didn't go on when I jumped up and down in front of it, was because the motion detector is infra red and it was extremely hot out which may have impaired the ability of the infra red detector to ""see me.""Will have to check this again when it's darker and cooler out but I may not be able to do that b4 returning from vacation.

2743,Sandra K. Gieck,"Good for outdoor use, needs subscription to save video","  I originally had my spotlight camera indoors, and I was not a fan. The quality of the camera was good, but the spotlight was very annoying (depending on the amount of light in your house, it can be more than a tad overzealous). After speaking with Ring, I am now using a stick-up camera, and it is working much better indoors. I would recommend going that route instead if considering this for indoor use.A couple of other things to note are battery life and subscription. To put it bluntly, the battery life on the spotlight camera is not good. Ring has a solar panel option that offsets this, so I would recommend getting that instead of the standard battery model. With one battery, I couldn't get more than a few weeks out of a full charge (possibly related to the aforementioned issues with an overzealous spotlight). Additionally, you do need a subscription to save any video with these cameras. They only save video to the cloud, so to get the full use of your camera you need to pay $3/month for one device, or $10/month for multiple devices.I will also say that Ring's customer service is very good.

2748,Tom A,The Installation for Battery Spotlight Cam Is Easy,"  I purchased 2 spotlight battery cameras directly from Ring. I have had them  up a week. One battery  depleted in 2 days. The other is 50% after 5 days. Another camera on less active side has a better battery life. One battery is 50% after week and the other is still 100%.The company that installs contracted through Amazon does not install in my area and it took a long while to learn that and it delayed getting my cameras up far too long.  Since mine are not wired I finally found a neighbor to attach them to each side of my mobile.  I connected them to the internet with ease (I'm 82.) There are different settings but most of my notifications must be birds or the wind blowing bushes and trees. I do get s good range but in order to get my back porch, door and shed entrance I cant see my car in the carport. I can see anyone park on the street and i get almost al kml vehicles,  bicycles, golf carts and pedestrians going by as well as my neighbor across the street.I just changed internet speed from 50/50 to 75/75 today and there is noticeable improvement in download/upload speed to see live view. 100/100 would be even better.UPDATE Jul 23, 2019:  I live in a mobile and I am having difficulty getting a good signal and I have black screens at times or it takes a long time to bring up the screen.  My phone has plenty of memory etc and I optimize my phone several times a day.  I have been on the phone several times, and several times a day at times trying to solve the problem of my RSSI of 65, 70 etc.  Sunday, Jul 21st, I installed Ring Chime which is supposed to extend my WI Fi for the camera to work.  I connected both cameras to the Ring chime and it has not improved the RSSI except by a few numbers.  I have been told several times by customer service that the RSSI number has to be below 50.  The Chime itself is 34 and numbers around that.  With the assistance of customer service I moved the Chime to the few electric outlets I have and it really isn't improving my Ring RSSI numbers.  I disconnected one of the cameras from the Chime but the number of the other Ring Camera has not improved.  This is an old mobile home, built in 1971.  A single wide.  I have read possible the material of the construction, in my case, metal covering, could be cause for poor signal.  I do not have anyone at hand at my beck and call to help me get on a ladder and press the top button but as soon as I figure out how to do it (I climbed on chairs and stools and held on to the water heater cabinet on one side so I was able to press the button on one of them.  I'm 82 with bad back and knees and should not be doing this.  The ladder is too heavy for me and I fell off it once so I can't use it now.)  As soon as I can get someone to press that button on the one camera so I can change to my regular WI FI I will return the Chime.  I know this is a review of the camera but my point is the suggestion of adding the Chime did not help in my case.  The customer service also said I should move the camera and I would not be able to see my porch and shed access if I move it over.  It would be right in the open where if we have rains would rain on it.  Ring is a good product but all I am saying is for me it has been disappointing.  After I increased my internet speed the RSSI number was perfect for 12 hours and the picture immediately came on the mobile.  I am not sure I will keep Ring.  I have found that a skunk walks near my patio almost nightly. I get a lot of pics where nothing is shown to be causing it to record.  I am not sure it is worth it to record someone who stole plants and yard decorations 4 times recently but the person trying to get in my door at 1:30 a.m. could have been a one time thing.  The so called salesmen coming to my house at 7:30 pm and the same ones to my neighbors at 9:30 p.m. are what inspired me to get security cameras.  Oh, and the 3 different men who are ""lost"" and cannot find who they came in to see and knock on my door … they have no name, unit number (one finally said he had a unit number 365 but the numbers only go to 300) and no phone number for who they are to contact.  This happens so infrequently and looking thru so many videos (I live on a corner unit just yards from the street) I'm not sure this is worth it. There have been a few times the picture is black. Maybe a bird is blocking the lens but I don't know.

I recently sold my house and moved into an apartment. To make things simple, I purchased Ring's Alarm system bundle, with a battery powered doorbell and three battery spotlight cams. The doorbell and spotlight cams were easy to install and pair with the Ring Alarm System. All four cameras have a decently clear picture. However, two way audio is not clear either way.But the big disappointment is discovering that there is no way to adjust the recording length of the video clips. You had better hope that you capture useful video within the first 30 seconds of the motion activation. Otherwise you will have to wait at least another 60 seconds more before the cameras reset their motion activation. I wish I had discovered or read about this shortcoming before I purchase the battery version of these cameras. I would have chosen the wired versions of the spotlight cams instead.I assume Ring limited the video clips to 30 seconds to save on battery power. However, Ring should have let the user adjust the recording (and/or motion sensor activation) length or at least allow the video to continue for as long as there is motion detected. I would have rather have shorter battery power, with spare batteries to swap out, and capture useful video than have cameras that miss useful recordings.

The audio cuts in and out to the point where conversing with the person at your door is simply not possible. The video gets pixelated and is difficult to view. The camera itself is sub-standard. Anything within 10 feet is clear but beyond that it's just a blur. You would think with today's camera lens technology Ring could provide a more distant clear field of view. But it does not. Anyone or anything that causes the alarm to kick in - and is more than 10 feet away from the Doorbell may as well be wearing a disguise because you will surely not be able to discern who or what it is that set off the alarm. Then there's the latency between the time the Camera triggers an alarm and the time when you actually get to view the video. So long that any perpetrator would have stolen your packages and be in the next town! And then there's the unexplainable drops in connection. Complete loss of video and audio. Ring techs can't even figure out how to solve this problem. And NO, it's not because my wifi speed is too slow or my wifi router is too far away. I run at 300mbps and I'm only 50 feet from my camera. And now I just discovered that my video recording will cease after a few days and RING wants me to pay a monthly fee for a feature that was clearly offer to me as part of my purchase. It's a SCAM!

Even after it was ""calibrated"" with the app to ignore far off motion.The paid service also will NOT let you know if a camera goes off line. You would think that would be important information to share. I have to send continuous PINGs to it to ensure it is up but this causes the battery to only be good for about 3 days. Unfortunately that only proves my network is up. It can't tell if the camera is bothering to communicate to the Ring servers.I change the batteries regularly (There are two slots so I just put the charged one in and remove the 25% one.) You would think I would see footage of myself when changing the batteries. However, it only gets me about 40% of the time.

One general issue is that at night, when the spotlights turn on, the camera of course switches from night vision to normal and the footage looks pretty grainy as a result. But can't have perfection.If you are like me and looking for more advanced motion zone control than other battery cameras offer, and saw the image in this listing of a range setting in the app, be warned that the App is now different and that entire feature is misleading. You can no longer set Range on this unit.Now when you go to motion Zones in the app, you will get a still shot direct from your camera that has three zone segments laid over it similar to image in this listing above. You can turn each segment on and off, but there is no Range slider as pictured on this listing. On the following screen, you get a slider for Sensitivity, and this is what Ring support told me was the new ""Range"" slider. But I had already tried that and while it did reduce motion triggers from traffic on a road in front of the house, it also reduced sensitivity right in front of the camera itself. So it's clear this is a very crude solution. Since this was the major draw for my purchase, this is the reason for two stars instead of four. I don't appreciate making a decision to buy something from utterly misleading marketing material.Support are pretty good but couldn't help with this issue. They were easy to get hold of and listened to the problem. But it was clear that even my agent was unaware that this had changed as she was directing me to an interface that didn't exist.

This problem is widespread and very annoying at best. I usually spend 30 mins to an hour, repeating opening the door , rep lugging in the batteries, closing the door again. You then must wait for some time to see if it worked, because there is a 5 to 10 min delay after you close it up before it seems to show the batteries are changes and the door is not open.

So be aware, if there is an ongoing event in front of your camera, it will stop recording at the preset interval and then it has to recognize a ""new"" activity to start recording again.I am never able to get a moderate quality or most of the time , ANY connection to cameras if I am away form my home.  Streaming over phone data is a joke and usually doesn't work.  Completely voids the whole reason for having the system.  I could have gone to BJ's and bought a $300 8-camera DVR system and had better results.They have promised for 2 years they would be releasing 24/7 recording but that hasn't happened.Recognition software is horrible!!  I get 50+ alerts a day for a shadow across my drive or a tree sway across the street, but when a person comes to my house they are almost past the camera before it recognizes and activates.  I would return if I could, but I can't.  Too late",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2020"

2758,Robert Edwards,Nothing “Advanced” about motion detection,"  I purchased the Ring security system about a year and a half ago and have since added multiple Ring cameras, including a video doorbell. For the most part I’ve been happy, however, after purchasing the Ring Stick up Cam Battery, risking my life to install it high on my house, using the live view to confirm it was pointed in the direction to cover the desired area, and then activating the “Advanced Motion Detection” “Feature”, I recently noticed it wasn’t picking up motion that WAS slightly being picked up in the corner of my video doorbell. Upon further investigation I discovered the screen where you define the so-called “Advanced” Motion Detection “Feature” doesn’t cover the entire Live View, therefore the area I MOST wanted to detect was not even included in the motion zone. There also seems to be no way to define motion zones other than the so-called “Advanced Motion Detection Feature”. I may not be the sharpest tool in the bag but it seems to me this is a significant shortcoming, particularly given this product is a security camera, and purchasers of this security camera should be made aware of this shortcoming up front before making the purchase. I have sold products my entire life and I would never sell this product to anyone without making them aware of this shortcoming. If a limitation in the detection zone of a security camera isn’t a significant factor in the purchase decision then I don’t know what is.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2020"
2759,Donna Boardman,High failure rate,"  The good thing is that I left a review here about 2 of my 3 spotlight cams having problems, and I was contacted by a support person that offered to walk me through troubleshooting.  One cam lost the audio capability, the other lost the lights.  3rd one works ok.  The tech determined that indeed the two were faulty, and they would replace them and get them to me in about a week.  If I don't return the old ones in 30 days, they charge my card for 2 new ones.  All that's OK... but the problem is that these are spotlight cams... they go under the roof eave.  One of mine is 20' high, so now I have to get up on a ladder 20' to replace the cam... hang it and reconnect the wiring.  The other is only about 10' up, but still... this is a major pain in the rear, not to mention dangerous.  I guess I could pay somebody, but buy then these spotlights are getting way too expensive.  Bottom line... 2 failures out of 3 units is way too much, and the burden is on me to reinstall them.  While they work well when they work, I sure can't recommend them.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2020"

Amazon Installer (offered free by Amazon) departed before pairing the camera with the device - she offered to answer questions within the hour via text or telephone.  No response when I called before the 60 minutes were up.  I almost returned this 80th birthday gift that I gave to my Dad because we were left with obtuse and insincere offer of help after she departed so quickly.  She did not provide a quick walk through of the key functions of the camera, e.g., two-way talk or siren alarm.  I finally cobbled enough data from the internet to pair the elusive ""Echo Show"" to the Ring Camera - because there are no written directions, nor guidance from the installer.

2761,Kevin,Excellent non-hardwired solution,"  I did not want to hardwire and drill through exterior walls but did want an established brand that I thought would continue to develop their product, bring new features and flexibility. I have several of the cameras and easy to install and configure. The battery runs down as exactly as you would expect based on usage, I have one camera that is on several times a night as we sit outside and that needed charging within a month.So I bought the solar panels, a little skeptical due to varying reviews however they are absolutely brilliant and fully charge the camera every day except when consecutive dull days of zero sun. Then it creeps up over a couple of days.The cameras have a good coverage range and bright light as it states, it’s not a floodlight but bright enough to light up the immediate area as desired.I like the Ring integration with Alexa knowing that if any movement occurs that I have set up to detect, I will know about it.I have a some cameras connected to my wireless network, as they are close to an access point. For the others farthest away I have used a Ring Chime Pro close to those cameras and overall very effective.Couple of things I would like to see; Ability to define the field of vision (like on the Ring doorbell) would be an excellent addition. As would the ability to synchronize the light coming on with the schedule only, every time we walk out to sit outside it comes on once dark and I don’t need that feature until the alert monitoring schedule kicks in (the period of time I wish alerts to be sent to me - i.e. not during the day)Overall, completely satisfied. Always wanted external cameras but always put off due to hard wiring. Excellent performance and features and with the solar panels they are a complete success.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2019"
2762,Eric,JUNK,"  Difficult to set up.  Long hold times for ""customer support"" then the reps turn out to be no help what so ever after spending hours on the phone. Dozens of false alarms throughout the day and night.  So many false motion alerts that we have silenced RING on our phones because it is so disruptive during the day and night. Discovered that we were overcharged when we added additional cameras.  The charge should have been prorated when we added the additional cameras but instead we were charged the entire amount again.  This is probably happening to all RING customers.  Actually did have a problem on our property and at first felt  relieved that we had RING but when we went to view the video for the time of the problem, we found there was about 20 minutes where 6 motion alerts were registered but we are unable to open and view ANY video for that 20 minute time frame.  Called RING customer support and spent over an hour on the phone and all the rep could say was, ""I don't know.""  But at least we have thousands of false alarms saved.  That's helpful.  My spouse listed me as an authorized user and sometimes I can call with technical issues and the rep will help me but other times they say they can't help me because I'm not the account owner.  A married couple should both be allowed to have access to customer support.  Had to send  videos to law enforcement videos but law enforcement notified me there is no date & time stamp on the videos.  What!?  This system is a cheap piece of junk.

2764,CHRISTINA M Swanson,Better than expected,"  Ok i have purchased 2 of Ring Spotlight CAMS and can tell you they are great and work amazing. Battery life is also great!.However, to show you my honest review it is important to know how i started and where i ended up. There are some gotchas BUT there are solutions that work and worth looking in to. It all boils down to Frequency, Activity and Location.Lets startAs most users i started with Ring Pro Doorbell.Then i purchased a 2 pack of the Spotlight Cams (Cheaper than buying 1 wired and 1 battery cam - due to holiday savings)I set my Battery spotlight cam up for Frequent motion monitoring, Liveview enabled, and Light on for activity. This drains the battery the most. SO i used both batteries from the kit in the single camera and purchased 2 more batteries for the second camera. Lesson Learned. My Garage has more activity than a krispy kreme store (Well seems that way to me). So the battery would drain nearly 10% in a single day.  That means with 2 batteries i will get around 20-30 days of usage before i need to charge the batteries again. Didn't like that option so i purchased a wired cam, the wired cam was the clear winner in the garage.Now i have 2 battery spotlight cams with 2 batteries each and where do i put those?These were put outside so i could see the entry points to our house. Perfect! Activity is not as bad Literally a fraction if that. 2 batteries is an overkill for this situation but now i have a camera that drops 2-3% a day with the same settings. that means i can get about a month out of each battery (but there are two, so 2-3 months before charging)Reality,... WHO wants to have to pull out the batteries and charge them every 2-3 months?  Its not a big deal, but i am lazy.  So i was going to purchase 2 more batteries so i had 2 batteries ready for swap out while i charged the old ones. still seemed kinda lame as an option (again i am lazy) SO i purchased the Ring solar Panel (x2). THIS IS A MUST FOR BATTERY SPOTLIGHT CAMS IN MY OPINION.  Now they are recharged to 100% each day and never need my attention unless the battery goes bad.  IN about 2 hours of sunlight the camera replenishes roughly 12-16% of battery charge; based on my location in sunny Arizona. This  was a worthwhile investmentThis long review is just to tell you where i started and where i ended up at.NOW - The Spot light camera is perfect for all intents and purpose and works well, you won't be disappointed.But based on your activity, settings and location it hamper battery life. If you leave it on the default settings (Which honestly work fine) you can expect at least a 1-2 month life for each battery, maybe 3 months. If you are using dual batteries you may get twice that. BUT if you are going to be putting this camera outside i would go with 1 battery and solar panel, it is the best option.Camera siren will get attention, the light is bright, and the connectivity is not bad at all. most of mine are in the RSSI range of 32-49 which is perfectly fine. really 58 and down you are actually safe..lessons learned:Spot light battery cam Default settings one battery moderate activity (charge last 1-2 months)Wired cam has no issue with charge (because it is plugged into AC) But does have a few other options for Light brightness as well as motion activity zones.Solar Panels - Unbelievably the best combo for the Battery Cams.My Advice, pic up two, better to have the two pack and save some cash and set them up as needed. Great quality, reliable and work well. Just understand your need, application, and frequency to make sure you get what meets your needs. Which i didn't do, but in the end it all worked out and we couldn't be happier with our product.My setup right now consist ofRing ChimeRing Chime ProRing Doorbell Pro2 Spotlight Cams1 Wire Spotlight Cam2 Solar PanelsAll RSSI are in the range of 32-49 and work flawlessly. Ring app is also great to have and works as expected (Yes, you can download the app and use it without having to buy cams if you want to monitor what people are posting - which i would recommend)OVER ALL BUY IT, YOU WILL LIKE IT, WE DO.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2019"
2765,gio,"Lackluster product, poor motion detection, poor night vision quality","  I wrote my full review on the wired version. The same applies to the battery version with some exceptions the battery version was even worse than the wired version. The battery would last 3 weeks tops in an area of my backyard with little to no movement a day. The camera would record late and motion detection was worse than the wired version.  I purchased 6 of these cameras, yes... SIX... during Black Friday from Home Depot for a great deal. 2 months later and I have SOLD THEM ALL. For all of 2 months these cameras were a joke and inferior to real security cameras sold in today’s market. Now, 2 stars because daytime quality was actually pretty good. The motion detection worked most of the time and I was pleased. As soon as night time fell, these cameras were utterly worthless. It would catch no motion unless you walked within 2 feet of the camera. I was on the phone and chatted with Ring customer support for hours and I thought, why am I wasting so much of my personal time dealing with this nonsense ? These products are not cheap and I expect them to work without constantly communicating with Ring tech support, who frankly, were condescending and a waste of time. I have attached an image to show everyone how terrible the nighttime quality was. The quality will do you no good. You will not be able to identify a person, a face, a car, and most importantly you will not identify a license plate. The biggest concern is you won’t even be able to capture the crime happening because the motion detection is so poor at night time. I don’t know why there aren’t more reviews on YouTube showing people how unreliable this junk is. I told ring customer support how I would let the world know about my poor experience so here you go! Do not buy, I do not recommend, and I would definitely look elsewhere for your personal security and surveillance needs.

2766,Dbreezy209,3 Stars...and I really wanted to like it,"  I bought the camera directly from Ring cam.  I have a Ring alarm system and really wanted to like this camera.First, the presales experience was very poor.  I wanted to know the differences between the camera products.  I wanted to know if the issues brought up by YouTuber LifeHacker had been addressed. But I find the sales team to be completely lacking in knowledge of their products.  I had to stop the salesman on my third call back mid-sentence because he was so condesending.  I asked him to cut the B.S. and that I'm not an idiot.  Minus one star for the sales team.Second, the camera looks and feel very plastic.  Feels likea $50 camera, not a $240 camera.  Set up was easy.  It does work well with an excetion below.  It detected all intrusions and the image quality is good, but not stellar.  The solar panel does an excellent job of keeping the battery at 100% charge despite no direct sunlight.Third, the Live View doesn't work reliably.  Maybe I'll restate this....the camera is very picky with wifi signals and interference.  I live on 35 acres with no other wifi signals aside from own. Prior to purchasing this camera, I tested my wifi with my iPhone and a Wyze cam.  I was able to play YouTube video with HD quality without issues using my iPhone from my installation site.  My Wzye cam was at least another 50 years further away, and still sends a reasonable life stream.  This Ring camera have an RSSI-57, indicating moderate wifi interference.  What can I say...my iPhone doesn't have an issue. The Wyze cam, 50 yard further down the road doesn't have an issue.  Live View works, but I'd have to try to load it 4-6 times before it connects.  Minus one star.Lastly, I really wanted to take away another star due to construction quality of the camera.  But I guess appearance or not, it's whether it lasts that matters.  I'll hold off taking a star away.It's no more than a 3-star product.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2019"
2767,john S.,This outside camera is perfect for keeping track of my lawn service,"  While I wasn't planning on the following happening right away, I was able to dispute what my lawn service company was telling me. I had just gotten back on a Wednesday from a two week vacation. My lawn service was suppose to mow the lawn on Tuesdays.  While i was on vacation I received an online bill for the previous month. I quickly paid the bill as would most responsible customers. When I got back home on Wednesday afternoon, I walked into the back yard to clean out our ice chest. In doing so I noticed that my lawn was hadn't been mowed the day before. I texted the owner of the company about the lawn not being mowed. He stated that his men and ""for sure"" mowed the lawn on Tuesday. Not being use to having the Ring camera, I took a picture of the 8"" long grass and some weeds that were about 12"" long. The owner still wouldn't budge. Then it hit me right in the middle in the forehead, duh, you have a ring camera. Not only did I proved to him that his men didn't show up on the day before, they didn't show up the week prior. Finally he ate his words and many apoligy's were given. After that happening. I purchase another ring camera for both sides of the house to be covered. Thanks to Ring and the Ring camera, I held a business accountable, but probably also saved me some fraudulent charges in the long run.

2768,Chelle,Hate it! Nothing like the Ring spot cam (wired),"  Love my ring spot cam (wired) so I bought another one. But when I opened it a month later I noticed that it was a spot cam (battery) instead. My mistake and assuming it was the wired cam since the seller did not mention in the listing title and I did not read the fine print. So I am stuck with it since it is to late to return. After setting it up I noticed that you can not adjust your motion area only the sensitivity of an area, which makes it impossible to set the motion area higher so my dogs don't alert. And second even with motion deactivated for the day time and only had 7 notifications in 24 hrs it drained the battery and switched over to the 2nd battery all in just 24 hrs. I have talked to people with the ring spot cam (solar) and they have the same griefs with that also. And with a wired device you get 1 min recording, with the solar or battery you only get 30 sec. Another feature that is a flaw with battery or solar cams. So ring deff needs to address this real fast. So in my opinion if you want a ring device make sure you get wired, either plug in or hard wired. I also have a ring flood (hard wired) that I can not say enough good things about it.  Solar or battery ring products are no way as good as wired, period.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2019"

It does not film with clarity anything close to the camera.  If you are 40 feet away it will catch a person but with no recognizable features rendering the footage useless.

The hardwired Camers runs different software/FW and therefore they have better motion controls. The battery versions still have decent motion controls and are good. If you understand the battery version can’t run the same as hardwired due to power limitations this should make sense . My gripe is with what seems to be their hardware used for WiFi . All of the ring cameras struggle to grab a good WiFi signal . You’ll scramble and spend days messing with your WiFi routers etc. Eventually probably succoming to purchasing a new router or extenders to accommodate the cameras. This added expense should not even be necessary.I have to stress overall the cameras are good and they seem to be always improving the Firmware so they’re on it.

I paid for two batteries for each of those cams, and I’m lucky to get 3-4 weeks out of them before I have to get up on the ladder, recharge, replace, etc. Hugely disappointed. Yes you can turn down the sensitivity which means you won’t capture all the motion that you want to monitor.The night vision on both outdoor cams is not very good. It’s too grainy and too grayed out to give to police to identify a prowler. You also can’t capture license plates of cars at night. You’ll just see a bright white reflective rectangle.

Easy to change batteries. I subscribe to Ring+. Getting live feeds works very well.The negative of this system is that it does not consistently detect motion and record video. It detects and records what seems like every passing car, which leads to a lot of useless video. But then it does not detect and record the delivery guy dropping a package right in front of the door. Or the car that was parked in front of my house, but then disappears when I view the video of the nth passing car, and yet there was no video in between showing the person getting into the car and driving away.All the cameras are within 5 feet of wifi beacons.It is a pretty good system, but it is not a reliable security system. The tech is not quite there. It is good for getting live video feeds. And is good for an 80% chance of capturing video of something you want detected.

2777,MICHAEL J SHEEHY,RING battery cam  good alternative if don’t want or can’t have wired,"  Would give a 5 rating except  the 5 would be reserved for the “wired” video cam since it does not have the batteries that have to be charged and the battery model does have abt 30-45 second delay in accessing  movement.  I’ve used the battery cams for almost two years and overall am very pleased. Excellent , clear picture with ability to talk and , with the protection program, save  videos. The battery charges last a couple months and would advise to purchase two batteries ( unit fits two batteries) to lengthen time.There is a solar unit now that would probably ease the battery charging  issue. ( I am going to try the solar charger). Ring , along withits “neighbors” app  for  keeping track of neighborhood issues is an excellent product at a very reasonable price. Importantly, their customer support is excellent and rates an A+.Later: I have since installed the solar units for both my cams and am VERY pleased with the results. Super easy installation and immediately keeps batteries charged ( it says with abt 3 hrs a day sun).And again, kudos for the customer support people !!! In this day and age when customer support is often minimal, RING has trained their  staff well !!! Absolutely super !So now I would give it a 4 1/2.. only - 1/2 point would still be the slight delay in the battery models.

It finally came on after 5 or 6 minutes, and then once it turns off, it doesn't come back on for another 5-10 minutes. Whats the point of a security light/camera if it doesn't illuminate when there is motion?

They sent me a new Doorbell Pro without even me asking (just because they noticed my motion settings were cranked down on my classic version), they sent me a wired version of the spotlight camera as I mentioned, and they even went as far as sending me a mount version of the spotlight camera when I couldn't get the wired connected due to my outside plugs being dead. My Ring support Rep Alexis was patient and understanding during my multi-week attempts to get everything sorted, and eventually I was able to get the wired one installed outside and it is working fantastic so far. I went ahead and updated my review to 3 stars- even though this specific product (spotlight camera battery) did not work for me, the absolutely above and beyond customer service warrants 3 stars just by itself. I am going to use the Spotlight Cam Wired for a week then post a new review on it, and I am sure it will be 4+ stars just based on the build quality and responsiveness I have noticed already. Its insane how much more sturdy and well made the Wired version feels, and since its not trying to conserve power all the time it lights up perfectly and detects motion like a champ! If you are thinking about buying a Ring Spotlight Cam battery, go ahead and get yourself the Wired or Mount version instead so you can get a better idea of the great functionality the power-connected versions offer. It makes sense that the battery ones are less responsive because they are trying to conserve power, but for something that you use for home security you will definitely want the power connected versions!!!I am a full blown Ring Supporter due to all the great customer service I have received and I can't wait to add more of the power connected versions of their cameras to my already fabulous Ring ecosystem! My Ring Alarm system has been flawless since day one, the Doorbell classic and Doorbell Pro are great devices, and the Spotlight Cam Wired and Mount are great too. Its really nice having all my systems hooked into one app too. Hoping someday they will get HomeKit integration, but I don't mind since it's all in one place in an app. Thanks Alexis from Ring! I have already been recommending Ring systems to all my friends and family and even bought the Ring alarm pack for my brother in law for Christmas!",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2018"
2779,chris Yaktine,It won't do what you want to buy it for.,"  Paired with the solar panel (extra), this works pretty nicely as an untethered video monitor for my property  The 2-way audio is also good for scaring your friends or yelling at those pesky kids to get off your lawn.  However, it's got a number of glaring problems:1) The camera is really designed for near-field video.  There's not enough resolution for you to recognize a person's face if they're more than about 10-12 ft away, and there's NOT A CHANCE of catching a car license plate.  In fact, license plates are just a small blob of color on this thing.2) The several-second delay doesn't help with monitoring either.  It will register that somebody is driving down my driveway, but by the time it actually starts recording, the car has almost gone out of the frame.3) The worst bit?  After the initial free period (30 days?), you get no recording (not even a screenshot) unless you pay Amazon in perpetuity.  Which raises the cost of this thing SIGNIFICANTLY.  For that money, there are other, better options on the market.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2018"

   I purchased 4 of these battery cameras to go along with my Ring Doorbell Pro for complete coverage of the outside of my home.  I'm very impressed with the video quality in all types of weather and times of day.  The infrared works flawlessly as long as there is a tiny bit of ambient light.  I even installed one inside my garage in case it opens without me knowing about it.  You have to play around with the Motion Zones a bit for high traffic areas but all in all I would recommend.  I also ordered 4 solar chargers so I won;t have to worry about recharging the batteries every month.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2019"
2783,Mark Ernst,Great product but verify your storage costs and options.,"  I've had a Ring doorbell for a couple years and recently added this camera to cover parts of the driveway the doorbell does not capture. I wouldn't be without either product after having them and seeing how well they work. The camera works great and the solar panel we ordered in addition keeps the batteries well charged. The picture is extremely clear on the camera. The doorbell picture is very good, but I have to say I think the camera picture is even better. I love the Live View option on the camera - I can check my driveway any time of the day or night.I have noticed a few times when trying to use Live View, it starts to connect and show a partial picture on my phone, and then the screen goes completely black. I don't know if it's the camera or that I've lost my wi-fi for a minute, but since it doesn't happen frequently, I can't find a pattern to it.The only thing I'm not really happy about is the video storage plan. I paid to put my doorbell on the plan, and the online documentation states all devices on an account are covered with the video storage plan. When I added the camera, I found out I had to pay again to store the videos from that device. It all goes through the same wi-fi at my house and it's all on the same account, so it doesn't seem right to tell me one thing and then charge me more. I declined the additional charge just because of principle, but it's less valuable to have the camera if I can't go back to view what's happened since I last checked my phone. Perhaps when I am working again, I can afford to pay for something I really think I should already have.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 5, 2018"
2784,Amazon Customer,Good investment,"  So far so great! I have had it installed on the front of my house for a couple of weeks now and I have experienced no problems. My WiFi router is in my basement and I have experienced no connection issues. I have set the motion to about 15' in front of my front door and it picks up things on my walkway just before reaching the steps and platform in front of my door. I have had several detections that didn't make sense and I was able to identify it was birds flying by to a nest in a tree about 15' away from my camera. I even picked up a neighborhood cat last night. Every visitor that I have had, it has gone off before they reach my door so I have video kicking on before they step on my porch area. As far as battery, I didn't invest in $30 for a second battery or $50 for a big solar panal looking horrible on the front of my house, so I bought a third party wired plug in that plugs into my front outlet and keeps the installed battery that comes with it, fully charged at all times. The plug in is only $15 and if someone unplugs it, the battery takes over, so you still have power.The light is effective and works when the motion goes off. The siren could be a tad bit louder, but effective. The two way comms works well. I can hear EVERYTHING outside. Clear conversations. It's not as loud coming from my end. I think the speaker needs to be a little bigger or louder. So nothing really negative, and like I said, so far very effective and good video quality. I would HIGHLY recommend this camera!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2019"

I do have one question, why does it work so well picking out a dangling ivy blowing in the wind, chipmunks scurrying across the path, and moths flying around, but not capture a large UPS man setting down a package directly in front of it. He never shows up. One video has no package and then the next video has a package sitting there. Never a video of the delivery. Is there a scrambling device being used, and if so when will the criminals get the same technology? I am disappointed in this one problem. I also had a stranger leave a note on my car directly in front of the camera, and again no video. What am I doing wrong?",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2020"
2786,Joyce S.,This camera is awesome. I was looking for a solar option and ...,"  This camera is awesome.  I was looking for a solar option and this is it.  With the optional solar panel,  I have never seen the battery get below 80% in the night. I highly recommend this.  My only complaint is when the motion triggers as the light changes, i.e. you see the footage kind of flash with the change of sunlight during the day.  I won't dock this a star, as other manufacturers have the same problems.  I have ip cameras that I am phasing out for ring, they all do this.  This was simple and easy to install.  I have their floodlight and doorbell pro cameras as well.I've seen a lot of complaints about connectivity.  People, please make sure you have a decent router.  The cheap 40-50 dollar routers of old do not cut it anymore.  You need a router that can handle up to 20 devices simultaneously, at a minimum.  You may need additional access points as well.  Take your phone where you are installing your cameras and compare connectivity.  If you have your router stuck in a cabinet, take it out.  That will affect your coverage as well.  Just my 2 cents.  I hope this helps.Update:  6/15/2018I have two of these cameras paired with the solar panel.  I never have to worry about the batteries.  I am very impressed with these spotlight cameras.  If you are on the fence, don't be.  They are well worth the money.

2787,SJM,Not a good outdoors camera due to sensitivity.,"  Video quality, night vision, usability are all great. Where this product suffers is the reduced functionality. Poor motion sensing has the camera constantly picking up every change. The locked motion setting doesn't help the oversensitive camera either.  The motion zone setup in the app is confusing as well, as the its displayed looking at you, so to adjust the left zone, its actually the right on how its displayed in the app. I've messed around for countless hours on the setting for my camera on the front porch, but constantly receive false alerts for wind, rain and small insects at all hours of the day and night. This causes me to ignore most alerts or silence it altogether, taking what I enjoyed of a proactive security approach, to a more reactive setting.When put inside, these are awesome, but from how they are designed (batteries and solar panels) to be outside, they are of poor design due to how the sensitivity is relatively locked.I'd suggest the wired versions as the can be programmed better and fine tuned with motion setting and sensitivity for places of higher traffic and element exposure. Leave the battery ones for more enclosed areas, like a mudroom or garage/workshop.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2019"
2788,Pen Name,Easy to install and operate,"  Already having a robust camera system monitoring my house, I decided to get the ring to fill the voids where my previous cameras are not.  It took me less than 5 minutes to mount and another 5 minutes to download and navigate through the Ring app (iOS).Currently I have an ASUS AC3100 router with extremely heavy online usage with my tech family. Someone is either online gaming or streaming via multiple devices.  Internet service is only 100mbps so it’s not blazing.The ring distance from my router is roughly 25 feet with my router being upstairs and ring downstairs along with being separated by a concrete wall.With that said, it takes approximately 5-7 seconds to open the app and see what my motion alert is about when I am on the same network as the ring camera.The connection speed varies with my cellular provider which is highly dependent on my current location and signal strength. The longest I waited for connection was 15 seconds.Video quality is great and the app is very easy to navagate and also you can set motion area parameters and time events.If you plan on purchasing this awesome device I highly recommend you check current internet usage, router, and cellular provider (if using a mobile device to check your security system) to guarantee success like I have.Good luck.4 stars - would have been 5 stars but the unit price could be slightly cheaper.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2019"
2789,Julia,"convenient, easy install for great enhanced security","  We've been using the Ring Spotlight Battery to monitor our front yard in combination with the Ring Doorbell and Ring Spotlight Wired for our backyard. The Ring Spotlight Battery was the easiest to setup, since no wires are needed. It's much lighter than the Ring Spotlight Wired so we have ours actually strapped to a tree in the front yard rather than screwed into the house. Video quality is excellent. Only issues have been that the battery powered Ring Spotlight Cam only allow setting motion sensitivity and zones, so it's a bit of trial and error. We do get many more false positives, but the only alerts I send to my phone are for the doorbell and backyard. The front (where this is) I'll review if there's anything suspicious, so this works ok. It does records about 5-10 videos per day, and I'd say first battery lasted about 4 months before requiring recharge including high usage sessions (x3-4) when I was trying various parts around our yard for setup. Ring Spotlight Wired has many less false positives since you can draw out exactly what you want to monitor, rather than have general zones like the Ring Doorbell (1st gen) and Ring Spotlight Wireless. It did require a lot of trial and error both adjusting location and adjusting motion sensitivity settings, so before screwing it in especially if you have several trees with long branches like we do, I'd recommend avoiding screwing it in until you're absolutely sure after a few weeks you have a good location.We considered Nest cam, Blink XT, and Arlo.  With Nest, we didn't actually want to record everything 24/7, especially if we had 3-4 cameras we were concerned about killing our bandwidth. With Arlo, we didn't want to have a separate base station when we have great mesh wifi to work off of, and I didn't like the lithium batteries either if I had reasonable outlets nearby or good rechargables. Blink seemed to have less features and again required a separate base station.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 26, 2018"

I am very pleased with the results. Thanks Alexis and Ring.A big waste of money if you buy this product. Park a vehicle directly underneath the camera and does NOT detect motion. Walk the dogs everyday and have to walk right under the camera. Sometimes it records outlying it does not. When it actually does work, there is about a 15 second delay in being able to view what the alert is for. About the only thing it would be good for would be to get a video of someone stealing the product. But as stated before....would have to wait 15 seconds to see the theft.

When I do on occasion get it to goto live view, it’ll kick me out after 10 seconds and give me another error.  For the ring camera that won’t save clips unless motion is detected, live view is an important feature. I can’t even use live view it’s a joke. I know it’s not the internet, it’s less than 20 feet away from my WiFi box and have never had an issue with any other devices. Worked great for the first 2 months, and been buggy ever since.

Keep a flashlight by the door, you'll need it when you get an alert and cannot see a thing on the live view. There is never a time when something isn't wrong with at least one of the Spotlight cams or Doorbells.

I’m not sure why a company offers two slots for batteries but does not include two batteries with the camera other than they know one won’t last long and want to make another $30 on a second battery.Recently both batteries needed to be charged so we fully charged them overnight and when we put them back in the camera did not turn on. The reset button did nothing and the troubleshooting from ring did nothing.AFTER TWO YEARS OUR RING CAMERA IS COMPLETELY DEAD, NO LONGER WORKS AND NO LONGER UNDER THE ONE YEAR WARRANTY.

Almost didn't order the doorbell due to reviews. Glad I did order one. People are the problem. Ring isn't. Firmware updates for free. Cloud services are $10/mo or $100/yr. That is a steal. It is also an insurance policy if someone steals the device. Without cloud services you're only going to be using it for live feeds. Which defeats the purpose.UPDATE RETURNING DEVICES: I'm unhappy that I didn't know about the standard plug version and enhanced motion for the wired versions.

By the time the replacement arrived another of the spotlight cams had malfunctioned at which point I decided to send everything back but not before yet another back and forth with a different customer service rep. In both interactions with customer support, the reps showed a remarkable inability to track information previously discussed. As one example, in my first eMail I said I had moved the malfunctioning cam to different locations and swapped it back and forth with other cams with no change in function. Days later the rep said the issue could be related to the location of the camera. In addition: I shared the same complaint others had voiced in the videos being jerky and freezing; (2) even setting the sensitivity all the way left to “people only” the thing would still alert to my neighbor's cat (3) as near as I can tell the cams only record a max of 1 minute in response to a motion alert.On positive notes the cams are easy to install, the app is easy to set up and learn and the floodlight cam worked well.

I did have to let the batteries charge for about eight hours before installing the cameras, which was a bit of a bummer because I wanted to set them up as soon as I opened the box. These cameras have great picture quality and I've had no issues receiving alerts on my iPhone.  The two-way talk feature also works nicely, I'm able to quickly log on via the app and talk with whoever is at my door. The app also makes it very easy to turn on the spotlight and siren if you detect someone wondering around your property.  My only issue with these cameras is the battery. I don't see how the battery will last six months or more before needing to be charged. My cameras have been installed for 4 days, with light motion frequency selected, and the batteries are already at 80%.

After about a six weeks of use in a heavily trafficked backyard area and NO solar panel (we're talking dozens of alerts a day/night and I have sensitivity/range set to max and for the light to turn on at night) as well as lots of Live Views I burned through one battery and the second is at 60%. I think that's pretty good and I hope that with the solar panel I'll never have to charge the batteries.I do miss the more sophisticated motion detection that the wired Ring Cameras offer because I get alerts that I would prefer to ignore (squirrels, bushes and trees moving, etc) but I think it's a good tradeoff for not having to worry about wires.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2018"
2804,Herodotus,"With *very* reliable internet (which I bet you don't have), it's not worth it.","  I really want to like this unit. I bought two of them, and a ring doorbell even!  But I will say that it took me a while to get both the front and back working at all.  Once I was able to get video on my android device for front and back, I notice that it records blank video probably 1 our of every 10 times or more.  Okay, it doesn't record locally, it has to record to the internet (at $30 a year per camera).  And even though my upload and download speed is normally 60Mbs down/10Mbs up, it appears that upload is not reliable.  This makes it's all but worthless as an actual security camera.Also, the idea that some one walks up to your door, you get notified on you phone, you answer and talk to them at the door via you phone is a cute idea.  but it takes 5-10 seconds or longer for the initial notification them several more seconds to get video.  After 10-15 seconds, people at the door are not there any more.  It records them sitting there - actually the first few seconds are often very choppy, maybe a few frames, after that it gets better.So I'll place the blame squarely on the ""internet"".  You are not guarenteed latency (quick turnaround).  Even with ping times of 10ms and up/down of 50/5 very reliably, all it takes is some hiccup.I've worked with several routers.  Wifi connection is excellent (it's sitting right next to my router as I type).Without a local means of capturing video reliable and then uploading it, this is not a very useful device.  For $200 per camera + $30 / camera (or $10 a month of unlimited camera), it sounds great.  But keep your receipts and be prepared to ask for more bw from your internet provider.  If that even helps (it doesn't for me).Now, after two weeks, one camera will not stream no matter what we do with it.  Motion detection works fine, I can remotely turn on the flood light (thought that takes a min of 5 seconds - apparently the signal has to go to from my phone to ring then back to the unit).  I suspect I have a bad unit.In any case, I really have to say you are at the mercy of the internet with this device.  I get that Ring wants a month payment (that's the modern world) and I'd rather save video locally (and slowly back up to google drive or whatever) which would make it less likely I'd pay them monthly for storage.I've waded through all the help I can find.All in all this current product is unreliable.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2018"
2805,Polo Bill,Not as good as other Ring cams,"  I love my Ring doorbell and floodlight cams, but the Battery Spotlight cam isn't as good.  I added it along with my doorbell to cover some area blocked by the large pillar.  I thought it would have the same functionality as far as motion zones and sensitivity settings (all motion vs people only), but it does not.  It just has a generic 3 zones and you can set a theoretical distance/sensitivity.  I can't exclude the street in front of my house for instance like with the other cams.  It is set off all the time and had to set the app to not notify me most of the time.I tried screwing it into the wood siding on my house with the included screws and broke 2 of the screws heads off so be sure you drill some pilot holes first.  I was concerned about drilling into my house before being able to test the battery life based on other concerns I've read.  I will give credit to Ring's superb customer service though.  I called them about the screws, mentioned my concern about the battery life and they are sending me an extra battery.  Jury is still out on whether I'll keep it or not.  It will probably ultimately depend on battery life.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2018"
2806,Joshua J.,In an hour I was good to go,"  Easy to setup and install. The Ring company includes all the necessary tools (minus the power drill) to mount the device and get you up and running within an hour. You just have to decide beforehand where to mount the device. The instructions do recommend you charge the battery for a longer period but if you need immediate surveillance the battery is low but it is good to go. I found it easier to sync the device with your WiFi before you actually climb up a ladder and mount the device on the wall. This will save you a trip climbing back up the ladder and push the sync button on the top of the device if needed.If you have multiple Ring devices like myself, then think of name of the location before mounting the devices. The Ring app comes with the default locations for where you are going to mount the device i.e. front and backyard but you can customize the name of the locations for example pool area, basketball court, North Shore, DMZ etc.Once the device is connected on your WiFi and mounted then you are good to go. There is a warranty that if your device is stolen by the suspect Ring will replace it. Ring does offer a $3/ month service fee to have your footage available on their cloud subscription. That’s your call, everybody has their own priorities, that’s all I will say about that. It was a yes for me.You do not need to be tech savvy or be Mr. Home improvement. You just need about an hour of time, where you are going mount the device and name the device. My take away point, I like the fact that I don’t have to wire a power cable to the device, it has a rechargeable. I recommend shortening the perimeter of your motion zone, this will extend your battery life in-between charges. Would I recommend the devices, 100%!

I purchased these because my wife has been paranoid in our new home about ""noises"" at night. These have allowed her and I to sleep at night. I like that I can check on my house when I'm away and can see what contractors are doing.  The spotlight comes on at night when motion is detected and works great. You can turn it on whenever you want though from the app. I actually use the spotlight in my backyard as a bbq light when grilling.The app works great. Sends me alerts when motion is detected. Motion is very sensitive though so even a tree branch moving in the wind sets it off. You will need to adjust to suit your preferences. For me, this is just a way to keep an eye on my home when I'm away and also so I can look around without getting up in the middle of the night.The solar panels keep the batteries at 100% all the time. I highly recommend them because the batteries themselves don't last long.The picture itself is pretty good for both day and night. Be careful with placement because if it is near another light it definitely negatively affects the visibility.I highly recommend these cameras.

2816,Sarah,Additions needed to optimize camera $$$,"  When I purchased this Ring Spotlight Battery Camera,  I did not think things were so great with this camera. I really wish there was a hard-wired option for this camera. I tried to see what the battery life would get me out the box and it resulted in very poor lighting on the LED and a dead battery in under 24 hours. So needless to say, the battery that comes with this camera will need to be charged prior to use. The other thing I did not like is that the camera has the capacity to hold two batteries, but only comes with one battery. To fully optimize the camera's capabilities it would drain the one battery that it comes with. comes with one battery. So I purchased the Ring solar panel by Wasserstein for $34.99. I opted not to buy the Ring version for $49.00 just to save on some money. So this helped a little. I went and then purchased another Ring battery pack for $29.00. I really wish the motion setting up on the spotlight camera was like the Ring doorbell and the Ring floodlight camera, they truly let you customize what you wish to your want your camera to pick up.  So, all in all, I have invested $263 for those three items and two Ring Chime Pro Wi-Extender for $49.99 apiece. That was a great investment!

It is simply a detection on changes on teh camera sensor as it feels. No infrared.I get motion alerts from cats, even fabric waving in the wind or even snow flakes on front of the sensor. There is no way to change the sensitivity of the motion sensor. You can only adjust range (I suspect that this is also just a setting on which pixels should react on motion.Customer support is a mixed bag. Support rep Lisa tried to tell me all kind of nonsense that distance is a software bug and it actually is the sensitivity.

2819,FA1SGL,The motion detection really disappointed me,"  First of all I have no issues with WiFi connectivity. Fortunately where my camera is located, my wireless gateway is right on the other side of the wall. The issue is the motion detection.. it’s so poor. I really need a camera that is going to pick up movement in my driveway, and especially at night. I have played with all the settings and I keep testing this out but you have to come all the way up the driveway and basically stand right under the camera before the light flicks on and sends an alert. It’s just not acceptable. My doorbell misses a lot of stuff in the same way too, but I’ll leave that for the doorbell review. Anyway, when the camera finally picks up motion it records for only 1 minute despite continued movement, and even then, there’s a delay.. if someone wants to go up to my car and check if the doors locked they’d be able to do so very comfortably and never be noticed until they’re on their way back down the driveway, and that’s just not okay. I need a security camera that is going to be able to detect movement immediately, and record for the entire time someone’s on my property. So far, Ring devices aren’t capable of it. And trust me I’ve tried everything other than a different service. It’s literally either I put sensitivity on maximum and get an alert every time the wind blows, or I drop the slider a little and don’t get a notification until someone’s on their way out of my house after attacking me in my sleep and ransacking everything.

I initially purchased two battery/solar cameras, one for the front and one for the backyard.  However, given the layout of my yard, street, park, shadows and activities I learned a few lessons I thought worthy of sharing.My initial setup included the battery/solar powered cameras; however, due to the field of view of the cameras, I was getting a very high volume of false positives.  A false positive meaning an image with nothing in it.  A special thanks to Danielle, without question the best tech support person I’ve ever had help me.  If everyone who works for Ring is as good as Danielle, Ring will be around for a long, long time.  After some trouble shooting, we determined the wired cameras would be a better fit for my requirements.Just as Danielle had suggested, the wired cameras were a better fit for the area I was trying to monitor.Within months of installing the Ring cameras, we captured a contractor not providing the services outlined in the contract.  Had we not had the cameras, I would have never known I wasn’t provided the service, I would have been unable to have a meaningful conversation with the contractor, and subsequently been out of luck.In my application, the key difference between the wired and battery cameras was the wired cameras allowed for stronger WiFi connections as well as the ability to customize the security zone resulted in zero false positives.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2018"
2824,34west,"Initially pleased, then annoyed by poorly thought out design and flaws","  I purchased a total of 3 spotlight cameras and 1 doorbell camera to cover the outside of my entire house. The system was relatively inexpensive (under $700) and installed easily. With no wires to run I was able to mount all 4 cameras in under 2 hours. I mounted the spotlight cameras to my house siding with construction screws and the doorbell to the door frame. The Ring app for Android was easy to use and I quickly was able to connect to and monitor the cameras from my phone. Video clarity is pretty impressive in daylight and acceptable at night. The ability to share videos with your neighbors and directly with the police are also positives. Initially I was very happy and would have given the product a 5 star rating, but as time went on I became increasingly annoyed with the product. When mounted at the recommended height, the spotlight cameras cannot be aimed down enough due to the bulky body and poorly thought out bracket. Combined with the fisheye-style lens, this causes the motion sensors to pick up every car, person, animal passing by and even flag blowing in the wind across the street. Reducing the motion sensitivity to reduce these false alarms enough allows a person to almost be able to touch my house before the cameras catch them. I am constantly getting motion alerts on my phone and it is at the point where I all but completely ignore them. Battery life is also poor. The cameras need to be recharged every couple weeks and charging a single battery takes a good 6-8 hours when it is depleted. I haver also yet been able to figure out how to have the ring doorbell ring my actual digital doorbell. If my phone is on silent, I miss when someone is at the door. I plan to modify the provided camera mounting brackets to attempt to solve some of these issues but if I were to do it again, I would have purchased a high end surveilance system.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2019"

2831,A Gentleman,Not as good as Ring’s Doorbell or Floodlight Cameras,"  I have the Ring doorbell and the Ring Floodlight Camera as well.  Unfortunately. This Spotlight Camera is my least favorite of the three.  My main complaint is that the Doorbell and Floodlight versions both give you the ability to “draw” motion zones so that you can exclude high-traffic areas from generating alerts.  For whatever reason, the Ring engineers decided to only give Ring Spotlight users sort-of a “pie slice” graphic and a slider to move the zones from Min to Max.  Yet, you can’t see how the zones relate to your yard.  You’re stuck fiddling with it for days trying to get it right.  The Ring folks obviously have the technology to allow us to draw the motion zones.  So why didn’t the include it in the Ring Spotlight?  Also, I really miss the “All Motion” vs “People Only” slider, which is not included on the Spotlight Cam.  On the other cameras, it significantly reduces false alarms when set to “People Only.”  In fact, I had to turn the Motion Alerts off on this Spotlight Cam because it was sending alerts every time a tree would move in a gentle breeze.

My expensive Netgear Orbi WiFi network bandwidth is 10+ times what Ring's support site says is needed, measured with Ring's recommended tool, but after an hour on the phone with support, they tell me it's not enough. Want to sell me WiFi boosters - one for each camera (with no guaranty it will work). In fact I know it won't. During my support call, one camera failed ""Live View"" with the camera inside the house, sitting within 12 inches of my WiFi router.Rotten engineering, and a bad idea to put less-than-complete products on the market.Two hours of ladder time yesterday to install them. More trips up the ladder today to pull them down to send them back. ...and Ring is making me pay the return shipping...I bought these because of videos of badguys being thwarted by Spotlight cameras that I saw on Ring's Neighborhood system. Looking at those again, I note that local users have asked for more information about location, but none is ever given. Does Ring post false videos in the neighborhood to spur sales?I loved this company and some of their products. I was an early adopter of their video doorbell. I still like it, but I am likely done with Ring. Sad...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2018"

Had vehicle vandalized and the pixelation is so terrible with these cameras that you can’t not see any details just pixelated figures. Literally impossible to catch a license plate even 1 letter with this camera, digital zoom and nighttime over exposure is terrible. Day time image quality wise is a little better but still extremely low definition. Hdr function makes no noticeable change. Not an issue with my network as I have extremely high download and upload speeds with a router that triples the square footage of my actual home. I’ve also opened ports in attempt to provide the most direct connection possible for a wireless camera still terrible resolution on both spot light cameras.

2842,My Reviews,Will not buy a Ring again,  We purchased 2 Ring systems - one for the back and one for the front.  We used the battery one for the front.  After less than 3 months it stopped  working.  The batteries would charge - show a FULL charge - yet would be dead once the batteries returned to the Ring.  I called Ring and went through all the trouble shooting with them.  In the end they said I could buy another one and send the defective back and then get refunded.  I am sorry but how can a company expect someone to purchase another before having it inspected?  I deal with returns all day long at work - some for items that are over $10k... and would NEVER request my customer purchase another before it was serviced or even replaced.  Unethical to me.

Lately that's been 50/50.The app also will not remain connected for continuous monitoring.

2855,Amazon Customer,Wifi reception of devices is less than optimal.,  Ring is obviously one of the major new security cam companies that is trying to hit a home run.  Software is certainly key and they do a fairly good job here.  You do have to customize both motion range (cars driving fast down my street can still set it off even though I've brought in the motion circles on front cameras).  You also have to customize the times.  If it is a family home time then you'll be constantly getting alerts.  Almost better to have a two-hour pause.  With ring I went in and turned the alerts off during the normal times where were running around the house.  But also could be a vulnerability obviously.  Also you have to bring down the resolution from the highest or it will eat up your batteries sooner.  Although I do like these two battery devices.  Very easy also to determine which battery is getting low.  My biggest complaint is on the wifi reception.  They simply do not do a good job of reception.  I can bring my phone out and test the reception where camera is located.  I also put airport express to boost signal that are very close to camera's and I'm constantly getting poor wifi messages.

I understand that saving videos requires cloud storage but I am disappointed that Ring could not provide some very basic storage option considering the price of its products.  At least Arlo saves videos for up to five cameras for a week without the need of a subscription.  Without the subscription you still get alerts but by the time you get to the live camera, you will likely miss what caused the movement in the first place.

Initially I was skeptical but after our initial conversation she had shipped out 2 of the new Ring Spotlight Cameras and 2 Solar Panels so the batteries would not be an issue.I reinstalled the cameras and solar panels and they are absolutely fantastic.  This is how I thought the cameras should and would function when I initially purchased them.  The response is significantly faster.  It detects motions within 2-3 seconds of event in front of it.  I have not had any issues.  I love the the Spotlight cameras actually activate a spotlight when there is a motion to deter any would be intruders or etc.  The siren on the cameras work extremely well and very LOUD which the point of them.  With solar panel attached I have not seen my battery dip below 98% and it has been about 3 weeks since I have installed them.  I can really say I do not have any issues with them and they work as expected.I would like to give a huge thank you to Alexis for putting in the effort and time to work with me on a solution.  I certainly be purchasing future Ring products and this is main due to the quality of the products and the customer service that Alexis has provided.I purchased 2 of these cameras one for my front yard and one for my back yard.  I have these since End of November of 2017.  and This has been the single WORST product experience I have ever had.Cons:1. Massive delay when there is a motion to when it records and alerts you usually about 45 seconds to 1 minute.  I can literally open my garage pull my car out of the garage and close the garage door and it would not record. USELESS2.  HORRIBLE battery life.  They advertise as last as long as 6 months but honestly THIS WONT LAST MORE THAN 10 days. And then you gotta take it down recharge it which my unit takes an entire day to do so. Its just a hassle.3. Drop WiFi only almost a daily basis. Drops WiFi more than Tom Brady drops balls in the Superbowl.4.

My parents have Arlo cameras which are the same price and they is only about a 2-3 second delay between a motion and it recording and they do not seem to drop WiFi.  I have another friend who uses the NestCams and even though they are hardwired they respond in about the same time as the Arlos.I do not know how RING is a legitimate business but I would refrain from ever using these.

2868,Ben,Very good camera with great app interactivity,"  Almost a 5 star review!  Motion detection is a little challenging to get right.  The spotlight cam battery lacks a setting that the wired cam has, which allows you to control the type of motion from people only to everything.  Make sure you mount your cam away from trees or other stationary objects affected by the wind.The camera is easy to install and comes with everything you need.  Set up is also very easy in the app.  Wifi signal could be better.  I have 3 ORBI mesh routers and neither camera is more than 25 feet from a router, but the signal isn't that great.All in all I am happy with my decision to go with the Ring cameras, especially since we already have the Ring doorbell.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2019"

We like the ring concept, the fish eye camera is hard to view from. I will go back to amazon and purchase the needed charger for another $16 and run a power cord to it.  Also the battery cover is very hard to snap closed on this. It opens easy and the battery removes and inserts easy, but you must get the ladder and remove the battery, charge overnight then reinstall no problem.

She offered up a couple of different ideas to correct the problem and suggested a couple of different actions I could take if it doesn't work. I'm happy, and relieved, that one of her ideas worked.

Thank you Alexis and thank you Ring!Our mailbox was stolen right off the front wall near the sidewalk it was mounted to. So we got the Ring Spotlight Cam to monitor our new mailbox. So far, after 3 months of ownership, I have never seen the mailman put mail in our mailbox. The sensor picks up EVERY single car driving on our street, but it will not pick up someone walking right in front of our house, or UPS/FedEx putting packages in our yard, or anyone walking on our property, or me and my wife pulling out of or onto our driveway in our cars. The sensor sucks and completely defeats the purpose as to why we got it. It just blows my mind that it can pick up a car driving on the other side of the street, but someone walking up to our front door passing right underneath it will go undetected. The Ring products might be good for watching your dogs play in the yard when you are not home, but for security? NOOOOO. I highly recommend shopping around for other brands. Also, they claim the battery life can last up to 6 months, so far the realistic lifespan of the battery is about 2 weeks. And to answer anyone's question: Yes I have moved the camera around, switched locations and adjusted the sensor area on the ap.

Here's the cons: I don't like the fact that I have to pay $3 month (or $10/month) to view recorded videos. Granted, $3/month * 12 months = $36 is not a lot of money. I just don't like being locked in with a subscription model. I like the concept of Ring spotlight + battery, but I've paired it with the Wyze Cam, which has an SD card for video, and also includes Cloud recording without extra charges (but needs 5v power). That makes it a better long term solution compared to the Ring.

We had a door to door salesman walking through my neighborhood, and the camera picked him up leaving my neighbors house, but stopped recording by the time he got to my driveway.  If this had been someone coming to steal a package or something, it would have been useless.The other issue is the battery life.  Because they detect every car that drives down the street, the alerts are constant, and this affects the battery greatly.

2893,Gman,Ring is the BEST investment we made in 2018!  And here's why....,"  There tends to be a lot of research when looking for the right ""security/monitoring"" solution for our homes.  My brother was always a DIY kind of guy, and I let him run with it.  He set up a system at his place and mine as well.  My Ring introduction started from a Prime Day deal.  I admit it took a few months to get it installed, but ever since I've purchased 4 additional products and even got my brother to give up his DIY and he is all-in with Ring now.Back to the 'why':  From the time you receive your box, whether it's for the doorbell, spotlight camera, or other product - the entire process is designed with the user in mind.  I can't stress this enough.  Everything you need is in the box:  clear instructions, pictures, access to high-quality videos, drill bits, screw driver, etc.  So the hardware part is done perfectly.  Even more important is the 'software' part - namely the Ring app.  The way it walks you through the addition of devices, and the way it let's you set-up your motion zones and all other settings just shows this was tested so well.  I remain completely impressed with the product, enjoy the security/peace-of-mind it gives me, and how it also connects me to my Ring neighborhood.  The cost (monthly/yearly) IF you want to maintain access to your videos a bit longer is very affordable.  Well done Ring!

2895,D. P.,Pure frustration!,"  I bought this simply to keep an eye on my porch deliveries and see who's at the door before I bother opening it. The battery-powered spotlight seemed like a good idea since I didn't want the hassle of running new electrical wire, drilling through my brick, or having exposed cords. I wish I had done more research on security cameras before buying, this one has been nothing but aggravation and doesn't even effectively do what I needed.My biggest problem is placement: when I install the device for optimal motion detection, the camera isn't positioned to capture the video I want. With the camera positioned for the view I need, it's only triggered when the motion happens right under its nose (and not even consistently then). We tried about a dozen mounting areas—high, low, middle, and every kind of angle—and in no case did we get functional motion detection and a decent video view. And because the motion doesn't get detected properly, the video doesn't record anything useful: sometimes I get a notification and see just a glimpse of someone walking away, or an empty porch where I later find a “missed delivery” paper. I have adjusted all the settings every which way and nothing makes this thing work right.I bought an extra battery and they're lasting pretty long since I have so few motion events that cause recording. The bottom part that flips open to change the batteries seems super flimsy, and even brand new it's been finicky to snap completely shut (you will get an error on the app when it's not snapped tight). The battery compartment releases with a press of a button, so I guess a criminal could (easily in my case) sneak up, pop them out, and continue with their mayhem undetected. I didn’t sign up for the Ring cloud service, because I rarely have motion-triggered video that shows me anything of consequence.Other notes: I didn't have issues connecting. When we were testing locations, a few of the farthest away from the router showed “poor connection” on the app Device Health tab, but the camera was still working fine even then. I did have intermittent problems launching the Live View from my iPad, although at those same times the same app on my iPhone connected to Live View fine. The spotlight is extremely bright and the siren loud enough, but the poor motion detection makes those functions pretty useless.Like they show on the commercial, the Ring spotlight and floodlight are probably designed for corner-of-the-house-mount-looking-out-over-the-long-driveway-or-yard kind of situation. My porch problem can't be solved by either of those products or the doorbell, so maybe my house configuration is a really unique situation.

I suspect that this issue might be specific to the battery powered devices, but I don't have evidence of this. I called customer service, relayed this story and they refunded me promptly. This is a positive; however, my overall experience with customer support was just strange- for example, when completing their customer survey, I was asked if would I hire somebody based on one (presumably canned) email I had received. Simply insincere and ridiculous. I've since purchased Nest cams and have to say the overall solution is much more elegant, to the point that I'm considering switching out the doorbell for the Nest product. In short, would I recommend Ring products? No. Do your research. At this time, I'm liking Google Nest.

The first camera was installed in about 20 minutes, after the battery was charged and work great for the first 12 hours.  Living in Alaska, the weather was cool and rainy and after 14 hours the software stated that the battery door was open, and that it should be checked out as soon as possible.  When checking the equipment, I saw that the battery door seal was compromised on one side and it may be allowing humidity and moisture in the camera.  The camera stopped working that evening.  Before going to bed that night, I sent a request to RIng online about the issue so I could address it the next day.  I talked to Ring Support the following day who were extremely responsive and helpful.  They asked if I could send pictures of what I was seeing and as soon as they saw how the seal was coming apart confirmed my need to replace the camera.  I had purchased the camera at a store in our town and had to explain why I was returning for exchange and that it was not customer error.  As Ring Support had given me a detailed email recommending a plan of action, the store was very helpful in exchanging the camera, and they were not going to have an issue getting their equipment exchanged as they had a detailed email from Ring to facilitate their return.

One (1) was the mailman parking in my driveway (Ring Spotlight) and then the delivery to the door (Ring Doorbell).  Neat...now what if the mailman had been a burglar? I could have called the police from 200 miles away to have them check on suspicious activity at my home...cool.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2018"
2900,Matthew R Healey,"Had to have a factory reset after three days, stopped working completely after five.","  Bought this camera to go above my garage as I already have a Ring Doorbell Pro and a stick camera in my living room. Set up on this camera was not as easy as the Ring WiFi was so very hard to try and get to connect. After three days, the battery was saying that it was dead. When I changed the battery, the system would not reboot, it would not recognize that there was a new fully charged battery, and it did not work. I deleted it from my devices list in the app and tried to restart the set up. At this point, I had to spend 40 minutes on the phone with a tech services person (she was amazing by the way and very patient and helpful). After speaking with her and trying over and over again to get the camera to set up and once it finally did, I took it out and mounted the camera above the garage again. This morning (day 5) the camera is no longer working at all. It last picked something up at 7:43AM. The camera did take static video all night long and just stopped working after it recorded a motion incident at 7:43AM - though it did not pick up the movement at the garage when my husband and I were leaving this morning at 7:10AM. When I got home this afternoon, I took the camera back down and followed the same steps as I did with the tech over the phone two days ago. The camera will not turn on at all. No flashing lights, no anything. The inside battery light will still glow red indicating that the battery is in and is charged, but otherwise there are no signs of life.I like having the security of knowing that I can see what is happening on my property at any given time, and because I already have a Ring Doorbell Pro and stick cam as stated above, I have chosen to order a new camera and send the other back. I hope that I do not have these same issues when the new one gets here, but if I do, I will be sure to update.I would like to mention that I have done my internet connection testing and my internet connectivity was reading at RSSI -58 which is within the range that the camera should be working well in. I have a WiFi extender that is close to the garage and the doorbell. I have tried as many different things as possible to connect and keep a good signal, so I know that connectivity is not the issue.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 9, 2020"
2901,Sam Samson,DO NOT  BUY if you want immediate 2 way communication and do not want monthly fees.,"  the good: The video quality is fairly decent and the motion seems is sensitive enough that it has picked up the occasional wasp that flew in front of the camera. The ability to record the events is also a plus...but we'll go in to that later.The bad:  The bandwidith/signal on the unit I have is terrible. Even with their recommended wifi extender, the video displays take minutes to activate. By that time, your guest/intruder could be out site which negates the ability to greet or warn them.video recording: You have to pay a monthly fee (or yearly) in order to retain your video storage. there is no option to store the recorded events in your own locations as they occur (you can download them after the fact). Once your initial 30 day period is up, if you havent subscribed, you lose the files from the previous 30 days and all you have is live view, but as noted above, with the video delays, live view is pretty much useless.We have the solar panel installed, so I can't comment on battery life.If they can improve the bandwidth delays, and allow user selected video storage location, this would be a very nice camera system.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2019"

Good to know that you've got juice to spare if needed, which would be great, if they ever worked.Most of the time, it records blank video, and when it triggers its 8,000 false alarm movement notifications, you'll get to see live video maybe once. I've got plenty of free wifi spectrum and bandwidth (100Mb up, 3 Ubiquiti access points with broadcast channels and strength optimized), but it doesn't seem to matter.Absolutely trash product for what you pay for.

2910,Thor,Spotlight Cam Battery Review,"  My wife & I share this acct so here is the review for the Ring spotlight Camera Battery. First the size is pretty good once it’s up there you tend to forget it’s there until the spotlight comes on when it’s dark, LED lifts really light up the driveway and into the street. It is very simple to put up and it’s sturdy when it’s up there our street is very much a wind tunnel, even in some good strong gusts there is no to minimal movement. The speaker works great very clear voices coming through. We like to mess with our dog when she sets off the motion it’s just funny watching her try to find us. The motion schedule is easy to use, the motion range sometimes can be tricky to configure but once you got it then your set. Video quality is fairly good but does lag quite a bit even after we increased our internet speed. The battery charging can be a bit tricky but that could be from it possibly not taking a full charge or leaving it on the charger too long after reaching full but within a month I’ve already had to recharge one of the batteries but that could also be from the constant motion sensors going off like I said until you get the configuration correct. I would recommend this spotlight camera to anyone we’ve already told our neighbors to invest in them. We also have the Ring doorbell Pro and we are pleased with that as well but again but there is a lag issue as well with the video after replying to a motion detection. Hopefully an update will come out to fix these minor issues. So if your looking for a security measure for your home invest in the Ring products like the doorbell and Spotlight Cam (battery or wired and solar if I’m not mistaken). I forgot to tell you the night vision is awesome it really picks up on things at night and the quality is very good for a camera, nothing like our NVG’s when I was in the Army, but still pretty freaking good.

In reality, in my case, I see images at least two minutes after the device is triggered. Let me say that the live view image is very clear and impressive.

In response to the latter, we bought a Ring thinking it would help us catch these petty criminals in the act. How wrong we were. Since purchasing two cameras, one for our garage and one for our front porch, the front porch camera has failed to capture AT LEAST TWO car break-ins that have occurred less than 20 feet from the camera. I have made sure all the settings are such that the zones are placed to cover the street and it still has missed the actions. On top of that, in order for the camera to capture all of things going on, the batteries drain so quickly that it feels like I am charging one of the two at least one per week. So yes, I bought two batteries (upsell) in order to avoid having to constantly charge the batteries, but that, too, has not been the case.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2021"

Video quality looks alright, until a human being comes into the picture and you can immediately tell that the video quality is blurry. Faces are blurry, writing/script is blurry, so if you’re hoping to identify someone by this camera you’re not going to be able to tell who it is unless you can identify their clothing style, hair, etc. Slight learning curve with the range/sensitivity. Battery definitely does not last MONTHS. Maybe a few weeks. Installation was super easy. No DVR feature so you can’t look back at specific times, not constantly recording unless an event is triggered or you were already viewing it live at that exact moment. It is what it is.

This camera, by default, will detect and record EVERY SINGLE event during every single day and night.  You can only “turn off”whether it alerts your phone to each event.  So if you have a busy home or business, you can program the camera to not be alerted, but will still come home to 100 recorded and meaningless daytime events, like you yourself going in and out of your house a million times.

We were concerned about the low ratings but after nearly 2 months we really like them.Easy to install.  Wish the motion zone settings were the same as the Doorbell and that there was more schedule flexibility for the lights.  You will not get the advertised 6 months of battery life so definitely get an extra battery (Camera has 2 slots for batteries but only comes with one Battery... They run about $30) .  Of our 4 cameras, With the extra battery we get around a month to 5 weeks out of our busiest camera and nearly two months out of the others.  The app is easy to use and gives you a tile setting so you can view all of the cameras at the same time.  It will take trial and error to get the notifications dialed in the way you prefer but it is easily doable.  This is a very good option if you need a system and can't run cabling.  WiFi range isn't great but is adequate for our needs. Make sure you have a strong router and adequate WiFi speed or this will not work.  We have the Eero Mesh WiFi System and pay for 300 speed (TWC sucks so our speeds vary).  Typically we can have any where from 25 to 35 devices connected (Yes...

2941,John,Not up to par,"  I have several Ring cameras including the security light and doorbell.  I bought this camera as an outside security camera powered by the solar panel to overlook my front yard.  Setup and install was easy enough but overall this is my least favorite Ring device.  The motion zones are not customizable like they are with the spotlight cam.  You basically have the option of turning off or on three predefined zones.  Also, I have had several people move through the zone and the camera does not initiate a recording making it inefficient and unreliable as a security device.  Perhaps as in indoor camera this device would be more suited but as an outside camera, it is very disappointing.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2020"
2942,delasol,ring batteries exhaust one at a time...not together.,"  Ring makes a great product....recommend them.HOWEVER, if you're planning on buying an additional battery for spotlight cams that have 2 slots, in order to extend the time between recharges, know before you buy, that the electronic designers decided to make it so the unit exhausts ONE battery completely, then switchs to the other battery.What this causes is a CONSTANT battery low warning on your phone app when the first one used is at 15% which is intolerable.Instead, they should have connected the batteries in parallel so they both get used at the same time which would double the time between recharges, which is why I bought the extra battery in the first place.Save your money or buy a solar charger so you NEVER have to recharge a difficult to access camera.

I ended up picking up the Spotlight Cam Battery version because one became available thru a private sale.  Please note that the camera had not been used or even opened as the security seals on the box were still in place.  The seller bought several cameras and realized that this one wasn't needed as they had enough coverage.Upon opening the box,  everything was in place and had not been tampered.Installation was easy and the freedom of installing this camera anywhere was a nice bonus.  Coming with only one battery I opted to purchase a second one for the extended operation time.Operationally,  the sensors are great at catching movement and the image is not bad.  The short record time (approx 30 seconds) is like the basic RING  doorbell and that is fine for what I want it to do.  What I didn't like was short amount of time the lights were on.  However, the fact is, it is the BATTERY version so an extended lighted period would definitely kill the battery quicker. There is no limit when you perform the live view and turn on the lights.All in all it is a nice camera that allows the freedom of setting it up virtually anywhere with the limitation of it needing to reach your wifi and you have to access the camera to swap out the batteries!",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2019"

When the power interruption was over, my secondary wifi-based security system was immediately able to recover connectivity, but the Ring spotlight cams remained offline.  According to Ring tech support there is no way to get these cameras back online remotely.  The homeowner must come home to stand next to each camera and press a reset button! Forget Ring if you expect it to protect your property while you're on vacation. Fortunately I chose Simplisafe as my secondary backup security system, and when they come out with an outdoor cam I will buy it to replace these Ring spotlight cams.

And I was wondering why I am seeing tons of these on Ebay, Craigslist and Garage sale postings.You are stuck with spending over $700 initially, then you become their indentured servant and pay $100 a year, plus keep climbing ladders and taking your doorbell apart and recharging their batteries and reinstalling them!Good God Ring!....let us save our video ourselves if we want to!!!Anybody want to buy my setup ...all brand new for cheap?

2981,Ed,Buy the wired;  beware the battery!!,"  Most Ring products may be fantastic;  however DO NOT INVEST in this product.  ONLY PURCHASE Ring wired cameras with advance motion detection.  Forget worrying about the battery;  you can recharge it every 4-6 months (or if you have pets every 3 days).  But this camera has zero advance motion options.  This camera will “ring” your phone every 3 minutes if you have animals: or cars driving by: or people walking their dogs or ANYTHING.Point is;  purchase the wired cameras so you can select “motion areas” on the cam.  This is the first item I am returning to amazon on my 1,000+ orders!!!! Plus, I bought it on “Black Friday special” and Amazon will not “exchange” the battery cam for wired BUT i did call Ring before amazon and they were happy to exchange the two.  I screwed myself over by not buying direct.  Another lesson.Buy the wired!",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2018"
2982,Michelle,Provides great sense of security,"  Love 💕 my RING doorbell and camera!  I can answer the front door or the garage door from inside my home without opening the door to a complete stranger.  Also records all motion occurring and stores it indefinitely for a yearly fee of $30.  Also works well without paying yearly fee, just doesn’t store the video.  The motion detector may be triggered by bugs crawling on camera lens, a bit distracting but entertaining.  Range of motion is 180 degrees and clarity of picture is excellent.  Picture is a bit distorted due to fisheye lens.  I have no hesitation in recommending either of these products.

2983,C,Buyer beware: no value without a subscription,"  Without a monthly subscription, the product is nearly useless. Here's why: the camera detects motion, turns on, and begins recording it. It then sends an alert to your phone. That takes a minute or two.With a subscription plan, you can then watch the video that triggered the motion detector. But, without the plan, all you can do is attach to the camera live stream, starting 1-2 mins after motion was first detected. If the perpetrator was kind enough to wait around a few minutes, that's great, but otherwise, you miss the thing you bought the camera for (i.e., recording the neighbor picking his nose and sticking it on your windshield).So, set aside some serious money for subscription fees or just buy something else.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2019"

I had to play with the settings to get them dialed in to not using to much power but still capturing what I need it to......

2989,Teri Faulkner,Not worth the price,"  I have had two of these battery cameras for 10 months.  Bought them because of the battery option, and I really like the wired Ring flood light.  Their performance, however, is quite different from the flood light.PROS:1. Waterproof: one camera is out under the Florida sun and pouring rain, and it's still working2. Decent battery life: depending on how motion detection is set, the built-in lights and recording can drink up the juice quickly.  I get lots of notifications, night and day, and two batteries in each camera last more than 4 months.3. Good wide video angle and built-in lights.CONS:4. As so many others have complained about the lag in the recording, this alone makes the camera quite useless.5. Enable/disable live view option is there to save battery, but it is a pain to enable because it doesn't take effect immediately.  Have to wait for a next motion event to occur and that could be a long wait.  When I want to view it live, I want to see it immediately, not six hours later.6. Motion zone and notification settings just don't work the way you want them to work.  They seem to be useless.7. Video quality is not as sharp as the wired flood light.8. Mounting plate does not allow the camera to tilt downward to view the foot of the wall where the camera is mounted.  For example, you can't quite see who's at the door if the camera is mounted above the door.9. One camera is connected to a wifi extender, and it records a black image more than 50% of the time.  Signal is strong enough so I don't know what the problem is.  It seems the black image occurs when other ring cameras are also recording.CONCLUSION: The camera does not give a worthwhile performance, not for $200.  I also got the Ring door bell at the same time I got these cameras, but I am going to throw it in the trash shortly after struggling with it; it's too late to return it, but it's another story.UPDATE 5/2019: One of my two Spotlight Battery cameras is dead after about 18 months in operations. Its interior seemed to be dry without any visible leaks. It was out of warranty obviously, but I called Ring support anyway to find out what options they had for me. The technician walked me through several steps to troubleshoot, but I gave up when he told me to re-install the app on the phone because it didn't make any sense to me. He ended up giving me $100 coupon to get another one. I'm still debating on whether to get another one.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2018"

2993,Yixiao Sheng,then to make it better the wire comes off the side of the unit ...,"  Don't buy the RING wired security camera!! I have had the Ring wired camera for 5 months now and it has so many issues. It was poorly designed first off.The first Ring would not even turn on and I had to exchange it through ring customer service the day I bought it!The camera needs to be mounted to a wall outside and the power cord routed along the outside of your house as Ring suggests, where a thief can cut power to it?? It even suggests plugging it in to an outside outlet at ground level outside?? I decided to cut a hole in my garage wall and wire it into the house. The plug head was so big I had to cut a large hole, then to make it even better, the wire comes off the side of the mounting unit so I could not install the camera over the hole but instead next to the big hole and made it look cheap.Next the camera functions on and off at will if the temp goes above 90 degrees, even though it is rated for 140 degrees. So you cannot rely on the camera in the summer. You do not know when it is off unless you check through app, no alert it is off line.The camera also has a very hard time getting a good signal from our high end wireless router, even though no other wireless household products we have do. We even moved the router closer and bought the Ring chime pro for $50 to strengthen the signal with no results. Customer service just keeps blaming our internet provider but there are hundreds of people complaining of the same issue on many review sites. Ring even took reviews off their site now it was getting so bad.Now the newest version of the app is super buggy and having issues as of February 2018.Such a promising product but when you want to feel secure while away this product fails in so many ways....",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2018"

2996,Kev,Ring camera and WIFI signal.,  The camera must be very close to your inside WIFI source otherwise the signal strength will be weak. We have to use an extender which helps.

The connectivity between camera and iPhone is very slow.However it is nice to be able to “live view” your homes exterior when your away!I would certainly recommend the camera just make sure you deal with the WIFI issue the further away you get away from your WIFI source.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2019"

2998,Ray,Frustrating UPDATED 12/11/2018,"  UPDATED 12/11/2018First off I'd like to point out that I still continue to have problems with this particular product.After posting my two star review regarding this product, Ring reached out to me. They offered to have a phone call to review some things such as my motion history to see what exactly was setting off the device. After taking the initial look at the history they noticed some things were setting it off such as squirrels or steam from our dryer. They were quick to point out that yes, this is detecting motion, but it should still be smart enough to differentiate that and people. They explained why and mentioned that updates are coming to make it better! I also received an official email outlining those future updates!The headliner here is that Ring's customer service set me up for success and offered a better solution at no extra charge! They realized that the product i purchased was not doing its core job and offered a better solution! Absolutely no hassle. The new solution is working perfectly!Amazing customer service. 5 out of 5.Pro's: Setup was easy and all the tools/hardware was provided. Clear, wide-angle image when the camera has a good signal.Con's: Poor Motion Detection Settings leads to a frustrating amount of notifications.Summary: Overall, I do not recommend this product for anyone. At the bare minimum, buy the WIRED version which allows better options for Motion Zones. On a sunny day, the camera will send DOZENS of notifications to my phone stating that motion has been detected. Sometimes, its every 4 minutes. I go to check the camera feed, and nothing is there. I don't have any trees or any other objects in my yard to trip up the camera so I'm not sure what motion it's seeing. Reading into the reviews, it appears that many others are having the same issue.Occasionally, I will also open up the feed (whether its from a notification or just want to view a live feed), and the camera will not load. It will just spin and spin. The camera is located in a spot where it receives a good signal from my AP but yet it fails to load the feed.RING - Please fix this issue.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2018"

The commercials depict this product as the greatest thing since sliced bread and I would have been HAPPY to give a good review if they worked, but they do not.  I bought the NEST camera system, and they work flawlessly.  And to all the skeptics, yes, I made sure the batteries were charged all the time.  I placed the next cameras in the exact same locations as the Ring products and have ZERO issues.  I changed nothing in settings, modem, etc.  The Ring company has the absolute worst customer service...even worse then Comcast and that's BAD!

It doesn’t record the whole time someone’s in the motion sensors it just records for the 20 seconds. And you can’t keep the spotlight on. Say if I just wanted the light on cause I was doing something and needed it on, it’ll only stay on for 30 seconds unless I go live.

3073,Marty Martinez,Camera is good but......,"  For the most part this camera does what it is supposed to do which is alert me if someone is on my property. My only gripe is that if someone pulls up to my house, say like the ups man, and he has to go into the truck to sort packages the camera stops recording before he actually walks up to the house. I did look in the settings to see if I could change the length of the recording time but didn’t see anything.

The new ring spotlight camera that I just installed where my old ring spotlight camera was located has a poorer nightvision than the old ring spotlight camera.

At no point in the setup process was it indicated that I needed to pay for a service to actually store any captured videos. Last night someone stole something off our front porch, checked the app, only to be informed that everything had been deleted, and I needed to upgrade to a Ring Pro plan. On top of that, there's no way to upgrade your plan in the app!

But hey, if I'm at work and want to show my buddies live feed of my house, that works flawlessly everytime.

3089,Paul Hughes,A Solid Product!,"  So far I've been quite happy with this purchase overall.  The cam works as advertised & the picture is incredibly sharp when you have a great cellular or WiFi connection on your phone. The set up was easy, and the product feels well built when you remove it from the package. The spotlights are bright at night and I was really surprised how much coverage the camera covers. My only two gripes are the bottom where the battery well opens and closes is made from plastic and doesn't feel very durable or well crafted, in fact you really need to make sure it ""snaps closed"".  My second issue isn't really anything to do with the cam per se, but if you have don't have a ""decent 4G LTE"" cell connection or WiFi when you're out and about the product is pretty much useless, you can't view the video, use speaker, turn on siren, etc.  It will obviously still record and you'll have to view it when you get a good connection.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2017"

I just wanted something that would illuminate my backyard and not blind the neighbors, and this does just that. Set up is fairly easy as well. It loses one star not for the camera itself but for the ring app and some connection issues. I find that the app is very slow despite having strong signal and it has trouble switching from one device’s live view to another, often producing an error.

I also have the stickup cam which in this world if someone breaks into my house I'll have it recorded same as with the spotlight cam and ring doorbell.

3232,Not Half Baked,Battery version stops recording too soon,"  This review is for the Battery version of the Spotlight Cam, connected to a Ring solar panel.  I also have the wired Doorbell Pro and battery Doorbell.This product has good picture and generally does a good job.  But it has a critical flaw: it almost always stops recording 30 seconds after it detects motion, even if the motion is continuing, and it will not restart recording motion for a period of time.  This is likely to preserve battery, but since I use the solar panel (which keeps the battery nearly full all of the time) this is not a concern for me.This flaw has consequences.  For example, recently a suspicious car pulled into my off-the-beaten-path driveway, where the camera is.  The Ring video shows the car pulling in, but as the person is about to exit the car, the video cuts off.  There is no more video.  There is no video of the car leaving.Assuming this is a software issue, Ring should reconsider how it prioritizes battery life vs complete video, especially for users who have a solar panel.  Or at least give users the option to prioritize longer recording over longer battery life.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2017"

3309,Dan,THIS PRODUCT WILL NEVER BE WORTH THE COST IT IS A BETA VERSION - SERIOUSLY DON'T BUY THIS YOUR TIME AND MONEY ARE TOO VALUABLE,"  This really feels like a Beta testing product it is very expensive and has so many bugs and problems.  Expect to devote hours and hours trying to optimize every aspect of its use. You will have to buy and extra battery and a Solar panel unless you want to climb a ladder 2 twice a week. You will definitely need to buy a wifi extender - they will try to sell you their chime wifi extender product (dont buy it- it's junk) They're are many better extenders. Expect to be calling, chatting and emailing Ring many many times for many many hours. I spent just under 700 at ring plus another 140 for two wifi extenders plus 100 dollar a year service plan and i'm not sure I can justify any of it.The cameras rarely catch movement in time the video despite having excellent wifi signal, the video is blocking or choppy such that I would ever be able to use it to identify a suspect, beyond an object approached my house then teleported closer then teleported away from my house. Nightvision rarely works if at all. Live view takes so long to open up the person is long gone ( I spent hour trying to activate live view over and over before giving up last night). I would say at least I have a insanely expensive motion activated led light security light but that doesn't even work except 1 out of 50-60 times.  I honestly think if I bought a 30 dollar cheapy SD card camera it would function as good if not better and I would have 650+ dollars to buy a guard dog.I fully expect RING to take this product off the market at some point in 2018 they know it is a lemon but they have warehouses of product they need to empty; my guess is I will get a coupon for the next product and be shelling out another 700 for the non-BETA version of this camera sometime around winter 2018",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2018"

Didn't read about them first because my other items are great, but turns out the battery warning has been an issue for 3 years and they refuse to acknowledge it's a problem or fix it. I also hear the battery lasts only a few weeks, which is really bad. Was going to get solar panels later, but seems it's just going to be better to return them.

3709,Gene Lynwood Lavinder,Not What it Used to Be :/,"  Boy, this product and company has gone downhill! Support is overseas, so good luck there. My rep couldn’t understand that I wanted to reuse my name/number but every thing else was new.The mounting piece is poorly designed in that it doesn’t allow for the heavy device to sit in it securely while one adjusts for optimal position without seeming like it will fall out. Also, some indication of which is top vs. the bottom of the mount would be nice as I installed one upside down:(It did not alert me to anything, especially a low battery, like the app used to do back in the early days.If mounting near a door, it should be low not high up as pics and videos show for two reasons. One, ability to change the battery that lasts a stupidly short time. Second, to capture the height of say, below the waste of the average visitor, since panning down with the device risks it popping out of the base. Capturing those packages being delivered to a porch is not an option with this! Best for mounting to capture at a distance.In the end, two of these purchased were a very expensive mistake! Going back to my crappy Blink devices!",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2022"
3710,HUNG LE,Excellent Purchase!,"  I have two of the spotlight battery cameras and I love them.  I will be purchasing a 3rd in the near future.  The setup was extremely easy and they installed in less than 5 minutes. The video quality is exceptional, I can clearly see the target area.  My only issue is there is a slight delay at times regarding the alert, but that it isn't significant is not always an issue.  The battery lasts a LONG time.  Mind, I changed my settings so they are ""snoozing"" when I am outside with my dogs or doing other things in the yard.  I did notice that the multiple alarms would drain the battery quickly, but using the snooze function works for me.I wasn't sure what the night vision would look like but I am pleasantly surprised.  I see a clear video at night and the spotlight, while not illuminating a big part of my yard, does the job.  I am very happy with these and am thankful they are battery operated so I did not have to worry about wiring.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2021"
3711,Marc,These are amazing! Buying more!,"  I cannot begin to describe to you the utter joy and relief my wife and I feel now that we own this and have it installed. We live in a rural area and it's nice to know that whether I'm home or not, my home is better protected. Clear picture, easy setup. Batteries last decently (I would suggest getting back ups if you watch them a lot or if you live in a busy area). Batteries take about 5-6 hours to charge but once they're charged, they last for about two weeks with us (my wife watches it ALL THE TIME so our batteries drain exponentially fast). Do still get some false alarms from time to time (wind blowing the trees causing a lot of motion/animals in the neighborhood set it off, etc.)While these are awesome and weather resistant, weather can and will still affect it (to some degree). Rain can sometimes be an issue (water droplets on the screen which will need to be wiped/cleaned off) and at night, we had an issue sometimes with our camera fogging over. Simple fix: Go get de-fogger for glasses (like reading glasses). Follow the instructions and you shouldn't have an issue with fog on the camera anymore. We did that and haven't had an issue since.Super fast shipping and a pretty decent price for the peace of mind that we now have adding this to our camera collection. Would definitely recommend and am getting more in the near future!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 8, 2020"
3712,Nancy W,Worse cam comparing to the Bell & Stick Up,"  I own 3 different types of Ring cams (bell, outdoor stick up 2nd gen, & spotlight). This Spotlight cam is the worst.During the daytime, the sensor only picks up motion at ~20 ft (in front of it) instead of the claimed 30 ft. The detection distance is significantly shorter at night.The video was fine in a dry day. But we had a some rain last night, and the camera became extremely foggy. Whereas my stick up cam still gets crystal clear images.I’ll keep it. But this device needs some tune up.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2021"
3713,Scott Garrett,Needs better connectivity,  So the motion detection on this camera works just fine. There is a big issue though... the wifi signal does not reach very far at all. At times the signal can be reached but there are times when its just stuck in an “activating” screen. My apt is not even that far from the parking lot. The other issue is the battery. Tge battery only lasts around a week 1/2 before it dies. I know that the fix can be done by adding another battery or solar panel to it. So ok... out of all the concerns it would be the connection. I wish it had a long antenna like other secuirty cameras. I also wish there was a way that prevents the battery from being removed easily. Thiefs can easily take it... so yeah this camera has issues,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2021"
3714,Mike Minshall,Wi-Fi issues for power and Wi-Fi outages,  If you loose power and Wi-Fi is interrupted you have to be present to push a button on the camera to reactivate the Wi-Fi. This security system is completely worthless if you’re out of town and can’t push the stupid button.  This is also an issue if you installed the cameras 30 or 40 high.  I would have never bought the Ring cameras had I known about this technical flaw in their security system design and development.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 16, 2021"

They provide excellent piece of mind especially when we're out of the house knowing we can just check the cameras to make sure all is well. You can adjust the sensitivity and we've had some issues of cars on the street setting them off but that's about it. It's easy to share and save the videos if you want, and the light is really nice especially in our driveway. We bought the solar panels so we don't even have to charge them. Are there better ones on the market?

It only works for 2 hours then I have to call customer support the next day, it worked for only an hour. I just returned it. And I got the same device at Lowe's, same thing that happened, the battery compartment wouldn't actually close and therefore, the camera would not operate. I gave up and returned it the next day.

3788,Kim H.,RING NEW FEATURE APP UPDATE RENDERS DETECTION USELESS,"  I would highly NOT RECOMMEND RING CAMERAS!After several years of working a Ring home alarm and cameras and dealing with antiquated functions and performance, Ring made a bad system even worst with the latest update.The latest ""smart alert"" settings render human detection notification worthless, nada, non-functioning.while it will detect and alert a solo or a group of people walking by it will not alert you or a person's presence if that individual arrived in a vehicle. If delivery personnel parks in front of your house and proceeds to exit the vehicle and drops off the package at your front door RING camera will read it as a ""Motion"", not a ""Person"". this brings me to my dilemma of which I want to be notified if a person enters my yard.After contacting Ring SEVERAL times with my issue and complaints, I was finally told that there is nothing any customer rep and can do other than resetting the camera and function settings or keep making adjustments. I have to deal with it or hope they make a better system and even told once that they understand if I want to change to another brand even though I pay for the yearly Home security and camera cloud storage.

3789,Marc Ness,Works Great!,"  I purchased this camera for my outside basement entrance.  It's a covered entrance and works great!I was having an issue with the drain at the bottom of the stairs getting clogged with leaves. Water would build up and eventually leak into the basement.  I had the entrance covered, but it's not fully enclosed so I do get some leaves blowing down the stairs.  With this camera I can now view the entrance perfectly to see if leaves are building up by the drain.I also belong to a band and we practice in my basement.  Band members use the basement entrance weekly.  I used to have to leave the door unlocked so they could enter if I was not in the basement.  Now, I can see who's there and even speak to them prior to opening the door.I also like the security issue with having the light and siren available. Someone could go down to my basement entrance and no one at street level would even see the person possibly trying to break into my house.I have had no connection issues.The only negative thing I could say is that sometimes the lens gets foggy due to condensation and it's difficult to see.  This is not a fault of Ring's camera.  This would happen with any camera.Good product!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2020"

Often it wont go live when its just a few feet from my Wi-Fi while my eufy camera in the backyard farther away turns on live whenever I want. What a useless peice of technology, often times the mailman or delivery person drops off a package and the ring only sees them when they are leaving or not at all, and/or the video becomes frozen as soon as they appear. It is absolutely a piece of garbage compared to my eufy cameras that are all on the same network as this ring. Eufy sees everyone as soon as they appear, the video doesn’t get stuck and there is no monthly fee. Yes ring has a monthly fee just to keep your video captures, Without it nothing is saved which makes it simply a visual deterrent but useless as a security device. How could this protect you if there were intruders?

3803,Review ,Fine while it was working UPDATED,"  I purchased this camera to add to my Ring system on July 21, 2020. It worked fine until about two months ago. It had become so intermittent that it was no longer reliable. I spent an hour on the phone with a Ring rep, and after a thousand different tests they told me it was likely a camera problem(duh!). I spent two hundred bucks on it and it lasted less than two years. They wanted to give me a discount to purchase a new one (130 bucks) and I told them no thank you. A two hundred dollar device should last longer than one year and eight months.UPDATE: A Ring representative contacted me to try and resolve the issue I am having with this camera. We are now on our way to getting this to work again. I will try and remember to update again.RESOLVED! Thanks to Link at Ring he was able to solve the issue with the camera. He said to use a Chime Pro unit to boost the Wi-Fi signal to the camera. I already had a Wi-Fi booster and a very solid Wi-Fi, but I tried it. I had to try three different locations with the ChimePro but it worked. Link gave me the confidence back with Ring products.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2022"

3813,Martinez,Ring let us down too many times,"  If you need an easy method to setup a security camera to view your property in real time with low expectations Ring outdoor cameras will work for the most part.  I made a big investment and bought 3 cameras and the Protection Plus plan (over $500) which has let me down on multiple occasions.1.  The Ring camera motion did not capture 2 car break-ins as the Motion Zone shown is actually smaller than what is shown in the camera, so the thieves never triggered the motion recording near our car despite the motion line having both cars in the shot.  Passing cars from the street triggered motion recordings which created gaps between recordings to preserve batteries before resuming the recording (I have the solar panels installed now to reduce time outs).2.  The Ring Camera captured a still image of our 17-year-old American Home Shield Installed Heat Pump igniting something in mid-air after the defrost cycle started next to my daughter's window.  I was glad that I had a Ring camera setup in the backyard with the option to see the footage on the Ring App until Ring Representatives said the company automatically deletes still images after 7 days despite saying you have 30 days of coverage using the pro plan and Ring will not try to recover the images if needed for legal purposes.  Luckily, I was able to look back and screen capture my phone since before the footage was deleted (the Ring website won't show the same footage as it appears on the phone).  I needed to show independent footage from the Ring app because American Home Shield will try claim that that I doctored/photoshopped a downloaded image.  American Home Shield wants a technician to get our 7-year-old unit functioning again so they can check the box that the unit works to get out of paying for a replacement.  Since Ring's tech support will not help in recovering the footage they deleted, I cannot count on Ring to support us moving forward and will need to replace our units.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2022"

So if I wanted to adjust how long the lights stay in when motion is detected I am SOL. You can setup schedule time for the lights to turn on or off but that's it.

As soon as it gets dark, it turns to night vision, the batteries severely drain in the cold and give faulty readings, it has a battery slot for two batteries but it has never registered having two batteries only one, the motion detection isn’t nearly as good or far as the doorbell 4, even when it’s on max sensitivity. With all of these issues I surely thought we just got a bad cam, but after swapping this unit for a new one twice already, we’re on our third spotlight cam and till this day it still doesn’t recognize that I have two batteries installed and only gives me the reading for one. I have since given up.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2022"

3834,George Adamski,Connection Problems,"  This is my third Ring camera. The other two are hardwired and function perfectly. This one...not so much.The camera rarely connects when I want to live view. It takes me 5-10 times of connecting/timeout/try connecting again before it actually works. Of course by the time it decides to work whatever I wanted to see has gone.I have two batteries for it. They are also junk. I charged them a few weeks back and to my surprise they were at 25 and 10 percent this morning. I pulled them and charged them to 100 and 97 percent and reinstalled them. The batteries are currently reading 25 and 10 percent, after being off the charger and in the camera for less than 10 minutes.Tldr: the camera doesn't connect and the batteries don't charge.I'm sticking with hardwired Ring devices from here on.*Update* I paired this cam to a Ring Chime Pro and it now connects the way it's meant to. I also bought a solar panel to keep it charged and now the batteries rarely drop below 85%. Changing my review from 1 to 3 stars. Why 3 stars? Because I had to spend an extra $100 on a solar panel and wifi extender to get it to work right.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2021"
3835,Todd,Older model shipped.,"  Having bought these new (not refurbished), i was really surprised to find myself with a really old model. I only new this because the other two I bought at the same time came in the new model.Now there isn't much of a difference. But it does show that consistency lacks. I bought all three so they would be the same and not different. Not a big deal to some, but the older models had doors that wouldn’t always close appropriately and sometime would crack open while on vacation giving no vid afterwards. The new models snap the door closed with a button that recesses and clicks. The old model had a button that kinda just slowly popped back out making you question if it even latched of if the cushion/water seal pushed the door back out.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2022"

3841,Tom P.,It worked for a while but does glitches often,"  EDIT: Every day this week this camera has lagged out like this 4-5 hrs, and it is right above my office on the other side of the window so I know it gets good signal strength.So I have 8 total ring camera installed on my house, some inside some out but that is besides the point. I’ve had these all running with no issues for 3 months  well until now. I’ve made no additions or change to my network topography, no additional devices, and the connection to my isp has been stable.So what happens is it detects motion or a person and it for some reason glitches, from then on it will send you notifications of motion but not record anything.So I have it detect something in my front yard but it has no footage or recording for the past 5 hours. When attempting to view it presents a stream error.The only way to reset it is to remove the battery or reset recording ( this only works sometimes) but both methods loose any and all footage.This is a big safety issue because the entire point of them is to record the motion, to spend so much money on a system that fails to do what it advertises to do is sad.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2022"
3842,Amazon Customer,Frequent wifi connectivity issues,"  Update after several years:This disconnects all the time from wifi and is a chore to reconnect. I think it happens when the battery runs out and when the wifi connection is weak and disconnects.  Even when I bring the camera inside and put it right next to the wifi source, it still does not always connect.  It has become a paperweight.OriginalI've had this for only a few weeks now, but had to recharge for the first time after less than 10 days. I put it in an easily accessible spot, so recharging won't be too inconvenient.The setup was frustrating as it took 10-15 attempts to get it to sync and connect with the wifi even when standing next to the router and modem.Live view on the app sometimes doesn't work and I need to click on live view over and over and finally it may work.So it's been inconsistent, but I do like the convenience of sticking this in places where wires aren't practical.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2018"

3844,Amazon Customer,"Great sense of security, easy to use","  I've had this camera (with the solar panel) for almost a year now and it's still going strong. I love that I can monitor my home from inside or 1500 miles away. The app is pretty easy to handle though it may take a little time to get acquainted with it for beginners. We had a stalker situation last year and were able to show the police proof of all we'd be telling them, leading to them confronting the stalker and threatening indictment if he didn't stop (which he did).I still haven't been able to effectively set the motion boundary so that it picks up everything I want it to while leaving out what I don't. I've had to just leave it covering a pretty broad area. Even still, sometimes it will miss and only catch motion after the fact. I'm not sure why. But it gets it about 90% of the time, which has been very helpful.I want to install a second but the price is a little steep for me right now. Otherwise, it's a great value for all that you get. I definitely recommend the solar panel, though, especially if you live in an area that gets sun 90% of the year like we do in the desert southwest. Just mount it on top of your roof, face it upwards and you're good to go, even on cloudy, stormy days. Mounting both the camera and panel was pretty simple and quick to do with an electric screwdriver.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2022"

3846,Phillip Burrows,Below average and out dated.,"  I am disappointed with this purchase. This is my third spotlight camera. I’ve had my other two spotlight cams for 3+ years. My issue is, they haven’t changed a single thing in the 4 years the camera has been out. The price is still the $200 they’ve always charged, for a product that is out dated. Camera quality is out dated, my $100 stick ups cams are 100000% better in video, but suck at night time, and that’s where the spotlight comes in hand. I just don’t get how the stick up cam has 3 generations but the spotlight cam only has one. The stick up cam is WAY better with image quality and the camera is way smaller than the spotlight cam. I just don’t get why they can’t make a second gen spotlight cam. It’s a below average camera, and could easily be an above average camera if they just made a second generation. But I personally recommend the stick ups cams, you’re just going to want a lot of light for night time and you’ll be in good hands.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2021"

3855,Kevin Thress,Growing disappointment in this product,"  Have owned three cameras for over a year. Worked well to start, but things are going south. One camera stopped working on the network, no reason why. Changed out wifi range extender and that helped. But it also showed batteries not at full charge, when I had just charged both of them. Ring customer service reports hundreds of these complaints, and there seems to be no fix for it. I have rebooted, reloaded and recharged everything to no avail. Still reports same battery status. Even swapped the cameras... so I think something to do with wifi and their software. Customer service doesn't respond. Quality testing is just not good. On the plus side, pictures are good... did manage to see one ""porch pirate"" but not able to identify the face enough for police to do anything.

3856,Kathy,Unreliable motion detection,"  Installed about 9ft off the ground over my garage.  Motion detection worked sometimes.  Most of the time, though, it didn’t.  I put an indoor cam in a front window and it consistently captured me coming and going in my driveway, yet this camera had maybe a 50% success rate.  I’d walk under it and wave my arms and it still wouldn’t work.  Walk around the car and down and up the driveway and nothing except the notification from the indoor cam.I figured with so many positive reviews that maybe I got a bad one, so I returned it for another.  Same problem.  My driveway slopes downhill so I don’t know if that is part of the problem or what, but a security camera that doesn’t work is worse than no camera at all.It’s also worth noting that the battery drains very fast In the cold.  On one windy day it went down more than 10% using the default settings.  The solar panel can solve that but if you want to just use battery power, move to a warm climate before installing.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2022"

3864,Luke Steepy,Wall mount for Cam & Solar,"  Presently I have four Ring Cams for security outside of the home. I recently purchased a battery cam with a solar panel since I did not want to drill a large hole in the outside wall of my house  to install the Ring mount hardwire cam. So I ordered the Ring Spotlight battery HD Cam. I also ordered the Ring Solar Panel and Ring wall mount that holds the Cam & Solar Panel.The wire from the Solar Panel is 13 ft long. Since I am using the wall mount that hold both the Solar Panel and the Cam there was no way of hiding the excessively long bundle of wire. I spoke to one of the Ring Techs, and he said it was permissible to cut and splice the wire. I knew from the flexible wire that it was not a solid copper wire but would be several thin strands. I inquired if the insulated wire had one  or  two  bundles, the tech said it was just one. Once I cut the wire, I discovered he was wrong. there were two bundles, one red and the other blue. As you can see from my photo how I splice the two ends. The wire bundles are very small and the several strands within very thin, so you must be very careful in striping the insulation from the strands. I cut a wire connector in half, inserted the two ends of the wire and crimped the connected with a crimping tool. I wrapped each ends with electrical tape.I drilled two 1/4 inch holes in the Ring wall mount to hide the wires. (however, 3/16 "" hole would be sufficient) If you decide to do this, be sure to insert the wires through the holes of the Ring mount before you splice the  two ends together.As you can see from my Cam and Solar Panel mounted on the wall how finished it appears without the long bundle of excessive wire hanging behind the Solar Panel.The wire behind the Solar Panel is fixed and not detachable as the one that attaches to the back of the Camera. If anyone of you feel this is what you want to do, then after cutting the wire attached to the Solar Panel, you may want to practice stripping the insulation on the excessive wire left over before you attempt to strip the insulation from the Solar Panel wire and the one that will attach to the Cam.I hope you find this helpful.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2022"
