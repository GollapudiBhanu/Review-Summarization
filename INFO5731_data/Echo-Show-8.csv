0,Jeff,"Great, but for one fatal flaw","  I really do enjoy this device and am impressed at the abilities of Alexa. That said, until they add the option to disable the “Try Alexa” suggestions on the bottom of the home screen I can’t recommend it and will not be buying addition units.Looking online I am far from the only person driven crazy by this so I hope Amazon listens to the feedback and makes this possible in a future update.EDIT: The current top review claims that I (and everyone else complaining about this) am wrong and this can be disabled. While this person is right in the fact you can customize a lot of the display, the “try” suggestions at the bottom are not one of them. For the record I contacted Amazon support before posting my review to confirm this. Anyone who says otherwise is simply wrong.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2019"
1,Jeff,"Alexa, I don't want any ""Things to Try""","  Aaaaaaaggghhh!  The ""Things to Try"" sayings are sooooooooo annoying.  And they are so stupid and do not pertain to me at all.  ""Alexa, how do you say hello in German?"", ""Alexa, rap for me."", ""Alexa, how hot is the sun?"", ""Alexa, what's the temperature on the North Pole?"", blah, blah, blah.  They constantly scroll overtop of the pictures  and photos that you upload to the home screen and wallpaper, making them really hard to ignore.  And the clock is so small in the upper left corner, that you have to be right on top of it to read it.  I couldn't take it any more and had to return my new Echo Show 8.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2019"
2,Dan Curtis Fan,I thought it would be better,"  I had the echo 5 and I can't stand the ""try Alexa"" phrases at the bottom. From all the reviews I read on the 5 I wasn't the only one. I hope Amazon realized that people didn't like this. I will be returning this. At least make it a option.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2019"
3,Eric Moyer,Echo Show 8: Good But Not Quite as Good as the Echo Show 5,"  I have had an Echo Show 5 for over a month in my work office and like it a great deal. I ESPECIALLY like the ability to customize the clock.I received the new Echo Show 8 as a gift this past weekend and like it for most of the same reasons I like the Echo Show 5: great connectivity; good diversity of content and skills; and great as a sound speaker and photo display.But I found that the ES8 does not have the same options for clock faces as the ES5. There is no apparent reason for this, nor is it highlighted in the marketing for the ES8. Amazon, please update the ES8 software to permit at least the same range of clockfaces as the ES5.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2019"
4,Eric Moyer,So easy and so good with Ring cameras,"  I received my new Echo Show 8 - HD 8"" smart display with Alexa a couple hours ago. I had it unpacked and connected to my WIFI within 30 minutes. I have 3 Ring cameras, front door bell, a front & back yard motion light cameras. Once I followed the steps to add Ring in the Alexa app, like 2 minutes, It was so intuitive I don't know what I did right but another 5 minutes I said Alexa show front door and she said okay and there was my front door camera on the screen. Then I said Alexa, show back which is what I named the devise ""back"" and she said okay and showed the back yard camera, same with the front successfully. I have many more smart devices the Alexa app found on my wi-fi so I'm excited to figure out how to add them.Also, now I understand the importance of naming the devices. Alexa only understands exactly what you name them in the devise list for voice commands.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2019"
5,Alexander Scherr,A Great Addition to Your Home Tech,"  This is my first Echo device.  Had already set up several skills on the Alexa app before the Echo Show 8 arrived, so I was ready for it; and had my expectations already set as to the quality of the response to the voice commands.  If you are considering entering the Echo 'echo-system' and are on the fence about getting one of these, try downloading the Alexa app to your phone or tablet and try it out.  On the phone app (iPhone and iPad in my case), a button push activates Alexa; with the Show 8, just say her name and she starts listening.Some of the Alexa skills still need some work, and your satisfaction with them may vary.  But for the Show 8, it's great!  The speakers sound better than  I expected (actually are pretty awesome compared to the Show's size) and will fill the room with sound.  The Show 8 has an external speaker jack on the back, but I don't see ever using it - the internal speakers are THAT good - can feel the bass from the speakers vibrating the kitchen countertop.  With the speakers in the rear, having it backed up close to a wall provides the best sound projection and quality.  A similar concept to some higher end Bose speakers, which have rear-firing elements that are designed to reflect the sound off of a wall and provide more ambience.When music is played, the lyrics scroll on the screen, so you can sing along (if your housemates and dog can stand it).  Even when playing at a higher volume level, I can still get Alexa's attention but it may take more than one attempt.  The microphones are quite sensitive and will pick me up from another room as long as there is not much background noise.  The Show 8 also has Bluetooth, so you can pair it with a phone, laptop or other device and play music through the Show 8's speakers.  I do this frequently since the Show 8's speakers sound much better than the internal phone or laptop speakers.  I did notice a bit of a delay in watching a video on the laptop, and then the audio coming out of the Show 8.  It just may be an artifact of using Bluetooth to send the audio.Rather than the recommended stand (or no stand), I purchased the ""Echo Show 8 Adjustable Aluminum Swivel Stand"" also sold on Amazon (you can see my review of the stand on that page).  A stand is recommended to allow you to position the Show 8 at an optimum viewing angle.I also purchased several of the Meross Wifi smart plugs (also sold on Amazon).  Have them programmed to link with Alexa so I can give one command (such as ""Alexa, turn on Christmas Lights"") and ALL the plugs in the Christmas group turn on at the same time.  Pretty cool!  Once Christmas is over, the plugs will be assigned other duties.The Show 8 can browse the web.  There is a Firefox skill that will allow you to open a web browser.  And if you don't like tapping letters on the screen, you can pair a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse (see photo).  If you have an HP printer, it can be linked to the Show 8 to print grocery lists or stuff you find on the internet.Not a deal-killer for me, but can't seem to be able to disable the ""Try Alexa <blah blah blah>"" on the bottom of the home screen.  You CAN disable the skills cycling with other topics in the center of the screen as another reviewer noted.  I have the Show 8 in my kitchen; so the display is not ""in my face"" and I am not looking at it all the time, so it is not THAT big of a deal.Have to admit I was skeptical and wasn't sure if I would find it useful....but I'm liking this device more every day.  Now an Echo Dot has found its place in our household as well.  Along with some Echo Buttons....Like the Echo Show 8 so much that I ordered another one to give to my daughter and son-in-law!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2019"
6,Dave W. Dinges,"Scaled down version of the show 2, but a bargain","  I have a bunch of Echo devices in my home. Including the Echo show  2 10 inch.I feel like this is the best bargain at current prices.Sure you are getting 20 percent smaller in terms of screen size. But the difference is not too crazy.The screen resolution is almost the same. It looks very good.The sound is very solid in the echo show 8.I think the 8 is a compressed version on the 10 inch version. But that doesn't mean it's not good.Overall, I would definitely consider getting this over the 10 inch model. The price difference justifies it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2019"
7,cacalazani,Backlight Bleeding.,"  I love the way I can control Home Automation with Alexa. Was so excited to get the echo show 8, as my first echo screen unit. But as soon I powered it on, first thing I can see is the backlight bleeding so much. Is this normal to have that much, or did I got a bad unit? Anyway I thought it would be ok as you can see much when there is a brighter picture in it. But when it got inactive, I’ll have only a clock and a black screen full with backlight bleed. Will contact Amazon and see if it’s normal or if I can get a replacement.——Edit: Amazon it’s awesome, and it’s sending me a replacement. Will post back once the new unit arrives.——Edit: added a picture for comparison. Second unit looks really good. Thank you.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2019"
8,cacalazani,Great device except for one fatal flaw,"  This is a terrific device except for one flaw that ruins it:  A message displays at the bottom of the screen ""Try Alexa ....."" giving instructions on different ways to use the device.  For example, this message is displaying on my Show right this moment:  ""Try Alexa, show movies with Emma Watson"".There is NO WAY to turn off the constant display of these messages.  When Googling about this, I see hundreds of customers have already complained to Amazon about this problem. But Amazon refuses to give customers a way to remove this instrusive screen display.  Apparently Amazon thinks its customers are all 10-years old and need a constant on-screen display of instructions.This ""Try Alex ...."" is also a form of advertising, albeit advertising of Amazon's products.Until Amazon removes this display (or gives customers the choice of removing it), I strongly suggest buying a different company's product.  Google sells similar products.  So does Apple.  Neither company treats its customers with such contempt.UPDATE:  After submitting this review, I found a solution.  I wrapped a piece of black electrical tape around the bottom of the screen, positioned to hide the ""Alexa try ..."" messages, but not hide anything else.  The result looks great.  Those annoying messages no longer ruin the photos (or anything else) on my screen.  The only downside to this solution is it makes the screen slightly smaller.  But it's better to have a smaller screen that looks decent than to have a larger screen completely ruined by those messages.  I still recommend buying a different company's product.  It is ridiculous that the only way to block those messages is to cover the screen with electrical tape.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2019"
9,PJ,"""Things to Try"" makes this a product I can't recommend","  I wrongly assumed that this new improved Echo Show would offer a way to turn off the absolutely annoying ""Things to Try.""  I was wrong.  Until they come up with a way of turning it off, I can't give a good review to this product or to any other Echo with a screen (Show, Spot).  I would put an Echo Show 8 in every room if they would allow me to kill the Things to Try.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2019"
10,Su A.,No full screen clock mode,  GIVE US A FULL SCREEN CLOCK.  Why oh why Amazon does not provide the same clock options as a Show 5 or Spot does for the Show 8 baffles my mind.  1 star until that is fixed.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2019"
11,Su A.,"The Pros, Cons and Oks for the Echo Show 8 (HR).","  Pros:__________• Very compact and simple design.  I like these designs because they can fit in all rooms. Bedroom, Kitchen, and the living room this echo can fit in any location.• It has a large rubber foot that keeps it from shaking around.• Big fan of the black mesh fabric that covers the back of the device. It doesn’t become a finger/dust print magnet.• Extremely simple setup as you do the setup right on the screen (you don’t need to download any app). All you need is Wi-Fi and you’re basically done.• You can set multiple alarms and have them repeat on various days of the week. Change the alarm tone, have the sound gradually increase to get you out of your sleep, and be able to play the music that you want. This a customized alarm system that fits anyone’s needs.• To add more customization, you can make this device a picture frame. You can set a single pic or a slideshow of pics as your background.• I love the privacy. To have a “physical” shutter, to block the camera, is an excellent choice. If I didn’t have this, I would, like every laptop, place some tape in order to block the viewing. It’s very quick to just slide on the shutter. In this day in age, you never know whose watching. It’s the little things, like these, that shows that Amazon knows what we want (sometimes).• There is a button (next to the volume controls) on the device that will allow you to mute the mic.• You can say to Alexa ""delete everything I said today"" to erase your recorded search history (The little things go a long way).• Even when I block the camera shutter, I can still take calls or talk to Alexa.• The light sensor goes into a nighttime display when the lights are off. Waking up at 3 to check the time was quick and painless to my eyes. The sensor is able to add the appropriate amount of light, depending on how much light is in the room. It’s similar to the auto-brightness we have on our smartphones.• Has a built-in 3.5 mm audio cable which means you can plug this in your home speaker system. I didn’t find the need to test this out because it’s just plugging into another speaker.• Two web browsing options, Firefox and Amazon Silk, but I recommend you stick with Firefox (Found it better in the use with this device).• Like all voice commands, asking Alexa for the weather, make a call, play music, turn on a light (a smart light), and so forth does its job, most of the time (will go into details in the Con section).• Software-wise, I do appreciate that on the screen, if you hit the smart home button, organizes what devices you use frequently. I found this very useful to see what smart devices I use the most (what a shocker that it was the smart lights in my house.) It is useful if you need to quickly turn a specific smart device off.• If you have a thermostat smart device, one cool feature is changing the temperature with the Show 8. I ask Alexa to change the temperature of my thermostat and a slider pops up on the screen, allowing me too automatically to tweak the temperature further.• There is also a button, on the device menu, to turn off everything connected to the Show.• The voice calls come through the Alexa app or through Skype.• Does have Bluetooth. As Sheldon Cooper wisely once said, “Everything is better with Bluetooth.”• The microphone picks up my voice very quickly. This is having the TV on average person volume level and, probably, 20 feet away.• The screen is actually viewable. Having seen the Echo 5 in the past, The Show 8 screen is a huge improvement in viewing videos or getting a glance for quick info (weather, news highlights, time, etc.).• With smart screen layout, I can see this fit for security cams and baby monitors. I have a Ring camera on my door, and this works like a charm if I need to see who at the door.• Saying “Alexa, start my day.” Is a pretty cool experience if you spend the time customizing what you want to see and hear, from Alexa, when getting out of bed, You can have a very modern morning cycle.• Taking and receiving phone calls is a real breeze. I here no static or break in communication when talking to my colleague. Note that I didn’t try WIFI calling international.• To summarize, you have 4 ways of communication: Message, Call, Drop-In, and Announce.• When playing Foo Fighters, the Show 8 does display the lyric alongside the song it’s playing, “The Pretenders.” One word for this, Karaoke!• Good speakers for music coming in the Show 5. It’s loud, which was a little surprising, given the size. Not enough for a house party, but enough for study or cooking time.Cons and Oks:__________• You can’t watch YouTube videos by using Alexa’s voice command. You have to physically go and type it in the web browser. Google owns YouTube and as of 2019, Amazon and Google are not the best in merging software. A major buzzkill because learning how to do something is what YouTube is made for.• Instead of YouTube, Alexa will bring you to Wiki videos. They’re very basic, not a significant amount in video inventory, and I was only able to access the intro videos. I wanted to know how to bake cookies and I needed to go to the screen and touch the next video for it to play. Wiki videos don’t give you the opportunity to cook “Binging with Babish” videos.• Beware of the advertisement for watching movies and shows. Amazon loves cutting 30% of the screen with advertisements. You need to be prepared for this experience because this is not going away.• Unlike Google’s Nest Hub, when you speak to Alexa, the device will not show you what you said. Alexa has messed up in what I said, yet I don’t know which word that caused the miscommunication.• I want to mention this again, NO SUPPORT FOR ANY GOOGLE SERVICES. To be honest, Google owns the internet (Photos, Drives, Nest Cameras, YouTube, etc.) and with this device, all the basic searches/videos you want require additional steps.• Want mapping directions to go to a place around your city? Stick to google maps on your smartphone because Alexa doesn’t do this.• The camera isn’t anything to brag about. It doesn’t have any advance HDR features, but then again it’s only for video calls.• Web typing on this is miserable. I just stick to my phone if I need to search for something really quick.• The bezel around the screen makes everything look smaller than it is. Its screen size does help reduce the feeling.• No real apps are useful, given the size.• Alexa is no Google Assistant. You have to speak in a specific syntax in order for Alexa to do what you want it to do. With simple demands, Alexa works like a charm. It’s when you start asking random questions that Alexa will say “Sorry, I’m not sure about that,” or something similar. Example: I said ""Alexa, show me dog videos"" and nothing happens but saying “Alexa, open Prime Video,” it opens right away. Very specific on what you need to say.• No USB port to charge your phone. This Show, to me, is more for public viewing, the center of attention. A USB port would’ve been great not only to charge your phone, but to input pictures, videos, and even recipes into the Show.• When you start getting used to the Show 8, turn off Alexa tips. Having that feature on will clutter the screen by default. You have a small screen and yet the Show 8 wants to put as much as it can on it.• When streaming music from my iPhone to the Show 8 (using Bluetooth) the music isn’t clear as it’s plagued with Bluetooth artifacts. I have to assume this is a software issue, so it may be resolved in the near future updates. Still, I think you should know.• There is some lag on the touch screen. Tapping on a back button I have to wait 2-3 seconds before it follows with my request.• Want to move it around, you need to pay for the viewing angle attachment because you can’t adjust viewing angles without it.• The screen maybe a little too bright when it’s dark in the room.• The Show 8 doesn’t have any Dolby features, which makes the volume for music loud, but not clear. Playing acoustic songs are fine but playing anything other complex songs (Foo Fighters, Lady Gaga) distorts the quality of the song.• There are a lot of steps to just do a simple task. I wanted to pick my preferred source images and had to go through Settings, Home & Clock, Clock, and finally to Personal Photos. A lot of steps for such a simple task.Bottom Line:__________Of the Echo Show and Echo Show 5, this is the best one out on the market. The two things that make this the best between the three is the screen and the privacy layout. The screen is large enough that watching videos wasn’t a hazel, and the manual buttons for privacy are a must in this day in age. It’s a very nice design and I see this as something you will have in the kitchen of all places.The Show 8 does a lot of decent work, but it also has numerous other features that it isn’t the best at due to software issues. The resolution isn’t mind-blowing, as it’s something to either play music, or even a movie, in the background while you work. This is no replacement for a screen to watch for 2 hours as it’s more for a quick 5 minutes here and there. This is why I see this for the kitchen as it’s a great place to follow cooking videos. Anywhere else I feel it would not be put into use enough to be worth the cost.Also, I advise everyone to take a look at the Google Nest Hub, Lenovo and the rest of the Echo Show smart system. The truth is, for a universal home smart system, this isn’t it. The Google Nest’s software is top of the line in communication and user interface. The Show 8’s main highlights are privacy, video calls, smart house function, and the price. With the price you’re getting it’s a nice system to screen ratio, but if you’re not fully on board in the Amazon world you’ll be restricted in so many ways that sometimes it’ll be quicker to just take out your smartphone.Overall: The best of the three Echo’s, but most useful in the kitchen or at your desk.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2019"
12,Joyce,Mickey mouse design,"  Who designed this thing? I do not need a billboard by my nightstand, please remove the ""Things to try"" and provide a full screen clock. Give me a break.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2019"
13,RogerReece,Get something else,"  I was lured in by the good price on Black Friday, but I can’t recommend this device. Unlike some of the reviews suggest there is no way to turn off the things to try message which constantly appears at the bottom of the screen. I’m unable to select most of my Facebook albums, and the weather forecast does not stay - rather it rotates on and off.Overall this device accomplished nothing notable, I would not recommendEdit: an amazon employee named Kristina reached out about some of my concerns which I do appreciate and took some of my feedback. She confirmed that there is no way to turn off the things to try prompt but told me that it was a common feedback. While there is no published limit in the number of Facebook albums that it supports I found that after about 50 it stops looking which meant I had a lot of old albums to select from but nothing recent. The weather app can be selected as the only card but it doesn’t stay up, it appears for 30 seconds or so then Disappears for 30s and the cycle continues. Overall the physical quality of this device is quite good but the software lacks any sort of customization to the point that you pretty much get a stock experience out of the box. My original point stands that this device doesn’t really accomplish anything despite being well made",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2019"
14,Plastic Doc,Irritating Messages,"  This would be a great product, except for the annoying and persistent messages for ""things to try"" across the bottom half of the screen.

15,Honest Reviewer,"Echo Show is barely usable today, but does have potential.  Software not ready for ""Prime Time"" yet.","  The Echo Show is barely usable, yet has great potential.I say this because I wanted a nice Clock/iHeartRadio/Calendar/Weather Forecast/Voice Control for home automation device for my desk.  The Echo Show fails to provide these services...seamlessly.  Each of my requirements can be individually met, but not together.  Let me explain: If you are listening to iHeartRadio, then you cannot see the clock/weather/etc...  The BASIC function of what time it is does not work if you are listening to a radio stream.  The iHeartRadio app takes total control of your display, NO ROTATION of other apps.  There goes the clock.  Further, the font for the clock is not configurable.  Epic Fail for those with less than perfect vision.  The ability to customize this product to my desires/needs is why I rate this product as being barely able to be sold as an automation product.  To add insult, Amazon runs hints across the bottom of the screen: Try ""Alexa, open ....""  This is nothing but annoying SPAM!  You cannot disable this ""feature"".  I own most of the Echo product line and threw out the Google products because even with all of Echo's short comings it's still better than Google.  If you think that the Harmony product line integration with Echo is good, you are wrong.  Again, barely crosses the line of usability.  Example, you cannot set up a voice command to execute a single IR button (ie. arrow up, arrow down, etc..).  I have installed high end automation equipment in my house (Crestron) and compare this product with decent home automation.  Echo is not ready for ""prime time"" yet, has great potential...eventually...hopefully.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2019"
16,Gustavo Ferreira,"alexa, quit showing me suggestions!!!!!!!","  Update - There are reviewers out there who claim you can turn off the suggestions.  When I first go the device I went to the ""Home and Clock"" settings, turned EVERYTHING off, and I still get the alexa suggestions all the time.  One person also claims to have a full-screen clock displayed.  When my review was posted, I received a phone call from an amazon support person, and he agreed there is NO way to turn off the alexa suggestions and he also agreed there is NO way to display a full-screen clock.-------------------------------------------------------------I have the show5 and I really like it.  I have turned off the notifications but I still get the annoying alexa suggestions at the bottom of the screen.  On the show5, at least the alexa suggestions are in small print and I can pretend they are not there as I enjoy my large clock.  On the show8, all you get is a small clock in the upper left corner - no way to change it and since the screen is bigger, the mandatory alexa suggestions are in bigger font.  The good news - it was up and running in about 2 minutes and amazon music sounds good on it.  The bad news is, do I really want to keep it?  I really like the large clock face on the show5 and it seems ridiculous I have NO clock options on the show8.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2019"
17,Jeremy Buck,OMG Amazon please turn off the stupid things to try That is now on the wallpaper non stop,"  I got this primarily to use as a digital picture frame in my living room and it does a great job of scrolling thru my pictures and they display beautifully.  However, it puts the annoying things to try at the bottom of every single picture and is ruining it as a digital picture frame.  People have been begging Amazon for years too stop doing this and they keep ignoring it. I have turned off continuous scroll, Discovery,  and every other setting I could find and it is still there. This is infuriating.  I mean really, by now, most people know how to use their alexa devices, so why do they think this is necessary?!?! It makes no sense that they should force this on everyone .  I have an echo spot and even a show 5 that I was able to get it to at least only show it once, but on the 8 they apparently decided it should be a part of the wallpaper itself. You also can't adjust the clock size or position like you can on the show 5.

18,BJ B.,Software issues & needs more options !!,"  Just received my Echo Show 8, set up was basically the same as an Echo Show 5, however, there is differences when it comes to the menu and options, I liked the addition of optional photos to chose from but the option to have the day/date on the screen is gone, who would do that, also there is no options for making the time fonts bigger/smaller.  Would be nice also if you could change the font colors. The speed at which the pictures rotate is much to fast, at least for me, maybe more options would be nice like an hour or 2-3-4 or even as long as a day, have a different picture every morning.  The size is nice but without being able to enlarge the fonts .. well .. would be nice for people that can't see real well. Overall I like it but needs some fine tuning as far as options especially for the price.  Another thing is I really don't need Alexa telling me to try and do things all day long I mean come on, how about an opt out button.Update;  12/12/2019I had two brand new Echo Show 5's that got sent back for fixing after dealing/chatting with Amazon customer service several times over a two week period because picture rotation would freeze along with a couple other glitches that occurred now and then and got sent back two refurbished/renewed Show 5's, my point here is that my brand new Echo Show 8 is doing the exact same thing, so instead of going through the whole customer service fiasco again I'm just returning it while I still can and not getting another one.  Another thing I noticed that I disliked after using it for a few days was when you set a timer the numbers are nice and big with a count down, but after just a couple seconds the timer shrinks down to where you'd have to be inches away to read it.Maybe, just maybe when gen-2 Echo 8 comes out I may revisit it, but they need to make some major changes.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2019"
19,John Govern,Review that is currently “most helpful” for this product is wrong.  “Things to try”,  When I saw the reviews for this device and saw there was an argument about if you could turn off the “things to try” and the “most helpful” review by far was saying that “things to try” COULD be turned off I figured that it could be turned off and i should still buy the product. (I bought 3)  After spending 1 hour I can confirm the “most helpful” review here is completely false and “things to try” cannot be turned off in any way.  The most helpful review here should be removed as it is incorrect.

20,Experienced at life,Worst mistake possible. Terrible firmware,"  How Amazon thinks people will tolerate a device which force them to watch things on the screen all of the time that we do not want to ever see is amazing.Maybe they'll get the message that thousands of people are complaining about the same thing,  I wish I'd seen the complaints and poor reviews before hand.  I want to set this so nothing shows on the screen except the time in big numbers.  None of the THINGS TO TRY constantly changing and annoying us.This will be going back unless someone at Amazon tells me that new firmware is coming that will allow us to configure our devices to our needs.

21,Ms. T,“Try Alexa” that cannot be shut off is too obnoxious,"  I’m contemplating returning it, the “Try Alexa” feature sucks and cannot be turned off.Update.Within an hour of posting this 1 star review I received a call from Amazon support wanting to help me. Sadly there is no way to turn off Try Alexa, but they told me that they were sending recommendations to their product engineering team. Because of the call I decided to keep the device as I figured that with so many bad reviews this would be a priority for Amazon to fix. Almost 2 months later it is still there and annoying.

   I love the Echo Show 8. The only thing I hate the most is the SMALL DIGITAL CLOCK!! Why would you put such a small clock on a bigger screen! When the Echo Show 8 goes into ambient mode the clock is in the corner!! Lol. I hope you update this to a BIGGER CLOCK!! If not I'll send it back and be happy with the Echo show 5. Sound is great! Picks up my voice better than the show 5. I'm using an extra stand from my show 5 and I don't know if I'll need a stand right now. Please stop displaying ask Alexa this or try this on my screen. I don't want to see that stuff! Should be able to just display things I want to see!! It works great with my Wyze Cameras and all my WiFi lights. The sound is really really good!! Way better than the Echo Show 5. I can't stand the clock is so small! I had friends looking in the manual and online for a way to make that clock biggie! I hope I mentioned the ambient clock enough, so it gets stuck in your head's!! PLEASE UPDATE THE AMBIENT CLOCK! I wish I can change the color of the clock. I have until January 31 to return it.

23,Don,Yes this is incredibly annoying,"  So I read the comments before I purchased it stating that the ""Try, Alexa ...."" messages can't be removed from the screen.  Honestly I thought that was wrong.  But nope you really can't remove these messages.  They are on the bottom of every screen.  It is unbelievably annoying.  You think you should get use to it but you don't.There are complaints all over the web about this yet Amazon has done nothing.  Amazon if you read these messages let me give you a tip.  These messages don't make me more likely to use services they make me less likely.  I don't read the messages, I try to ignore them.Since Amazon is disregarding the input from users, the only option is to not buy the device and return the ones bought for a refund until Amazon adds the ability to turn these messages off.  Nobody buys a screen to be forced to watch ads.  Amazon if these messages truly added value then customers will leave them enabled on their screen.  The fact that you don't provide an option to turn them off indicates you realize they don't add value.I'm returning mine I suggest everyone simply think twice before you purchase one.  It truly is frustrating beyond belief that there is no way to disable these messages from the home screen.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2019"

   So I got the Echo Show 5 early Nov 2019 as the Echo Show 8 wasn't going to be released until the end of the month and I needed a new Bedside alarm clock.  While I did like it, I felt it was too small for my needs.  The Echo 8 finally got released and so I sent this one back and ordered the Echo 8.  It was easy enough to do a Return and order this in its place.  So Amazon is great there.So I've included some pictures while I had both the 5 and 8 at the same time.  You can see the 8 on the left and the 5 on the right.  Front view and side view along with it in the dark.  I also included a short Video where you can see them side by side with the light on in the room and then what happens when I turn the light off.I do like the 8"" Echo Show better.  The biggest issue I have is the size of the TIME.  Look at this side by side.  They are the SAME SIZE!!!  Look at all that wasted screen space.  I got the 8 so I'd have a larger clock.  But in a bright room, look at the SMALL time in the top left corner.  Look at the picture in the dark. The clocks are the same size, but the 5"" one is in the middle of the screen, and the 8"" once is up on the top left.  Looks at that black screen and a huge amount of wasted space!!!!  Why is this?  It's almost made getting the 8"" screen pointless.The other thing is the line on the bottom where it shows you things you can ask Alexa.  There seems to be no way to turn it off.  I've turned pretty much everything OFF and yet it's still there.  If you were using this 8"" as a picture frame, which you can do and have it cycle through pictures, great, then maybe a small clock on the screen is a good thing?  But with an all-black screen, what is the point then?I like that you can easily block the camera on both the 5 and 8 as you can see in the picture the camera is blocked and I have ZERo plans to ever use those.  Both can hear me just fine.  I can tell it when to set an alarm and it does it easy enough.  In the morning I can just say ""Alexa Snooze"" and it'll snooze for 10 minutes.  It hears me just fine.  It can play my Apple Music.  I do have a couple of Apple Homepods that sound better.  I could use them as an alarm, etc.  But I wanted a screen I could just peek at.  Apple has no other options.  I'm not using my iPad as an Alarm clock.Amazon needs to update this 8"" version to better work with this larger screen. Or at least have an option to have a larger clock on the screen.  Also at first when its night mode, the screen had this black background glow I didn't like where the 5"" version didn't.  Luckily I was able to adjust the brightness down just a bit which cured that issue.  Now I have a completely black screen except for the time.  The time is also not very bright.  It's not lighting up my room which is a good thing.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2019"
26,Morten,Video functionality doesn't measure up,"  Context: I'm very ""Alexified."" Two full-size Echos, a Dot, a 4K Firestick, and now a Show 8. Various household smart devices including lighting, smart plugs, and a thermostat. So, I'm technically knowledgeable and happy in the Alexa/Amazon universe. A friend has a Show 5, and I wanted a new device in my kitchen, to replace the Dot, which was connected to (i.e., plugged into) a better speaker. Along came the Show 8 (the friend told me he was going to replace his 5 with the 8). Reviews indicated that the sound was good (it is; at least as good as my previous wired speaker). I was concerned about the negative reviews about the clock and the ""Try . . "" notifications, but some reviews said you could change the options in Settings (and in case you want to know up front, those reviews are incorrect; you can't). So here goes with the rest of my review:Pro's:--Easy to set up, especially if you already have other Alexa devices.--Good sound for such a small device.--Functions just as well as my other Echo devices. Except -- this is a *video* device, and that's where it falls short.--Price and Delivery: I got this on the Black Friday sale (actually on Thanksgiving Day itself) for $50 off. Delivery was projected for Monday, but it was delivered in two days. Can't complain about any of that -- but, given the Con's I'm about to list, I wouldn't pay full price for it.Con's:--The clock. You can't alter the font or format. You can't opt for a full-screen clock. I realize for some people this is not an issue, but I'm nearsighted and wear glasses with progressive lenses. At the bottom and middle of my lenses (reading- and mid-distance) the clock numerals are out-of-focus from across the room. I wish you could set up a home screen with a large-numeral clock, but you can't.--Kitchen use, i.e., for me, mainly the timer. The countdown numerals appear when you start the timer, but then disappear as the screen rotates through its content. It would be nice to just look at the screen and see how much time is left, but you have to ask Alexa the question (just as I had to do with my Dot).--The ""Try this and that ..."" text across the bottom of the screen. You can't get rid of it. Yes, I read one review (which, at the moment Amazon is featuring as its ""Most Helpful""). This review says you can go into various sub-menus of Settings, and make it go away. I tried those suggestions. They don't work.So, I'd say, be warned, especially when the Show 8 goes back to full price. The Show 8 needs a software update that allows changes to the clock, the ""Try this..."" messages, and other functions.  It saves space on my kitchen counter, compared to my former Dot-plus-external speaker, but its potential advantages as a video device are either not realized or else compromised.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2019"

Terribly annoying.- Was hoping to make this a big Clock - like you can with the Show 5 - NOPE.  - The clock has fewer options  - The clock digits are actually smaller than the Show 5.End of the day, if you just want this to be a clock, you end up with a smallish clock in the upper left corner of the display and continually rotating ""Try ..."" prompts at the screen bottom.

28,Eric,BACK TO HORRIBLE!! -- UPDATE,"  I eagerly awaited the Echo Show 8 because I was generally pleased with the Echo Show 5. Like everyone else, I didn't like the try whatever crap at the bottom of the screen, but the large clock with date was nice. So, I thought I'd upgrade to the larger screen. HUGE MISTAKE!! The Show 8 is not like the Show 5. It WILL NOT display a large clock with the date AT ALL. What were you thinking Amazon? It's bad enough you're not responding to user complaints with the try whatever garbage in every screen. Now you took away the clock? EPIC FAIL!! I would NOT recommend the Show 8 to anyone. Time to start looking at what the competition offers. Better get on the software updates quick Amazon or you'll find people will go elsewhere for a more user friendly alternative.UPDATE 6/3/20Amazon FINALLY got their act together and updated the firmware to display a clock with the date on the home screen! What took them so long is anyone's guess, but better late than never I suppose. My review has gone from one star to four deducting one star for the time it took them to get this right.UPDATE 6/4/20Don't know what's going on, but the large time display with date is gone and it's back to the tiny time display without date again. Back to a one star review again too! I'm even more angry now that I was teased with a home screen time display more like the Echo Show 5 and it's been taken away.

We bought thisAlexa Show 8 to keep in touch with mom during the COVID-19 quarantine. She has no cell phone and lives in an assisted living facility that we could not enter, so we were concerned about setup. We had it shipped to us and set it up with my phone on our home internet. Amazon has special Alexa-trained tech staff to help with any setup difficulties. The learning curve was pretty steep, and online tutorials weren't always  helpful, so I had to call multiple times. Each time support was friendly, courteous, and really helpful. It took a week of playing around, but when we were done, I had the device set up on a new Amazon account with no credit card, so I could give the password to staff who would set up the device. We were able to block my contacts from showing up on the device (which is somewhat public and handled by staff), and family members all had drop-in permission granted on the device. Staff only had to set it up on their internet and re-enter the Amazon account. We had them set it in a place where private areas of her room (bathroom) are not visible to the device. Now we can drop in on mom and she can see and hear us well. She doesn't need to do a thing to answer. If we are concerned about privacy we call her phone first to make sure she would like a video visit. Mom was depressed and confused about not getting visits, and has not been able to use her phone well or hear it well. The Alexa speaker is loud and clear, and works really well.

34,Kirk B.,It's Just OK. I Wanted To Love It. Read About Deal Breakers Here.,"  So I bought this Echo Show 8 on a whim for my bedroom because I wanted a better sound for music in there than the Spot that I have now. Granted it's much bigger and there are no comparisons in virtually every area measurable. However, I was disappointed with two things.First, the depth of this unit seems excessive and it's definitely not best used on a nightstand. It just takes up a big footprint. I thought I had ample room but with a lamp, a coaster, and two charging pads for my phone and watch, I had virtually no more room to even put the TV remote down on the nightstand.Secondly, and most importantly, it only has two microphones on the top of the unit. Whereas the Echo and Echo Dot has four and seem much more sensitive when detecting my voice. The Echo Show 8 will sometimes barely pick up a command when the Echo Dot in the next room, which clearly has sonic superpowers, will reply back. I have two Echo Dots in my home, one Echo Show 5 and now this Echo Show 8. The Dots far out perform the Shows when it comes to sensitivity and average percent that they are correct in interpreting my request. They are all supposed to have far field technology where, as I understand it, two Echo products may hear a command but the closest one responds. This needs a lot of work. And I believe the answer is quite simply that the Dot has four microphones. Two more than the Shows. Which seems odd to me considering the vast difference in price.Now as far as the sound goes, it is really quite good for the money. After adjusting the equalizer in the settings to up the bass, mid and treble. You can also request these to be increased or decreased by simply commanding something like ""Alexa, increase the mid""  (or treble or bass). Each request increases the setting by one level. I believe there are five positive levels and give negative levels from the flat center.After tweaking the sound settings, Alexa does not sound hollow and music is full and fills a small to medium sized room. Bluetooth pairing from your phone is also simple and I like that I don't have to rely on the Alexa app to modify settings. The setup was super simple as expected. It's just a matter of logging in to your Amazon account with the touchscreen prompts. It guides you through everything you need to complete and customize your home screen/clock.Using personalized photos is a little clunky because you are forced to create an album using only Amazon photos instead of just uploading what's already on your phone's native photos app. That's actually a really big negative. Because of that, I don't have any personal photos on my Echo Show.If you don't follow what I'm saying, lemme give you an example: when you use Facebook, for instance, and you want to upload a photo, the app simply opens your phone's photos and you can randomly pick one or several photos to create your post. Here, you must download the heavy Amazon Photos app which just duplicates your already existing photo app. Then you must create a specific album of photos that you want to see on your Show. Then you must share it to the Show. I believe that changes to the album can only be done thru your phone with the exception of discontinuing use of that album all together and going back to the default Amazon screen saver photos, which you can do on the Show without your phone. But again, you cannot make changes and add or drop photos to the album you've shared without the Amazon Photos app on your phone.So here's the deeper issue. Since most Android phones are already bloated with endless and mostly useless Google apps, it really irks me that I must download another set of heavy apps to have Alexa simply turn off the lights or play some sleep sounds or to show simple photos of my family and friends on the Echo Show. I just don't like the fact that Google and Amazon can't get together on much of anything. Personally I prefer Google Photos over Amazon's but Alexa is hands down better than the Google Assistant and their related devices. If Amazon released their own phone, I'd buy it simply for ease of integration for my smart home devices and to avoid duplication that eats up valuable storage space. C'mon Amazon, forget the Samsung Galaxies of the world and introduce the Alexa Universe. Lol.My last complaint it that the Echo Show cannot surf the web like the Kindle Fire tablets or like any tablets, for that matter. Alexa decides what she chooses from the internet and from what sources. You can only choose in the settings whether you want her to use the Silk browser or the Firefox browser. But you cannot access the browser directly either by touchscreen or voice. For instance, let's say you want to know about the history of your hometown. You must ask Alexa to tell you about it. She almost always defaults to a Wikipedia article. You have no choice to open your towns own website or any other source. She does not even give you the option of links to open after her cursory relply because, again, you are not able to access a browser directly.So in a nutshell, I use this device now in my bathroom to see the news headlines, listen to music with lyrics displayed while I brush my teeth, and have Alexa turn the lights on and off in the bathroom. It really serves no profound purpose but admittedly looks kinda cool. I'm sure to keep the camera cover closed in the bathroom just in case there's some weirdo somewhere across the country who hacks Echo Show devices for his own show, if you know what I mean.I can see this being useful for someone who cooks and wants to see a recipe (that of course Alexa chooses) or for someone who may not like a smartphone to do visual calling with loved ones. And of course the sound is much better than the Dot or Spot. But really it serves no unique function that you phone cannot do sitting on a stand that costs $15 on Amazon. So I have it in my head to buy a couple Echo Plus devices and create a home stereo group on the Alexa App along with my Spot so I can have the visuals, still, but in a smaller package plus the nice, full sound in my bedroom. Ugh. What a rabbit hole I've fallen into with Amazon. Yet, once you turn everything over to Alexa, you can't go back. My fingers are crossed for my invitation for the Amazon Ring. Now that's a unique product that I can use and fills an untapped niche. Pick me Amazon! As if I need more Alexa devices. Haha.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2020"
35,Tim Dobbins,A review from someone who has owned every Echo Show device...,"  Amazon had produced some great Echo show devices but they still haven't grasped the idea of how to make this the optimal user experience.My first Echo Show was the original 5"" model introduced in 2017.  I was one of the first to purchase this and three years later, it still performs admirably.Since then, Amazon has introduced a massive 10"" model, a smaller 5"" model and now this 8"" model.I have bought all of them.My absolute favorite is the 10"" model.  If you have RING cameras in your home or you want to use this as a photo frame that will continuously show your photos linked to your Amazon Photo account, this is the only model you should be considering.  Yes, it costs more, but the extra real-estate makes a big difference.I bought the 5"" model to use as a bedside clock.  However, it was too small.  I went with this 8"" model to use as a bedside clock, though despite user recommendations on how to make it work, it doesn't operate as a full-sized clock.  The digits are minimalized to one of the corners of the screen.I am now looking at the Lenovo clock as that 5"" made specifically as a bedside smart clock display.But getting back to the 8"" Echo Show...It's a terrific unit with a beautiful screen and it absolutely is a compromise between the smaller and larger models.The problem is, it still operates the same as it did back in 2017.  There doesn't seem to be any software revisions that make the Echo Show a better user experience.For instance, no matter what you turn off, the display is always showing a rotating list of things to try.  It may be helpful at first, but it's annoying after a while.Want a news feed displayed to your screen?  You really can't personalize the kind of news that you want.  In essence, this is the heart of the problem concerning the Amazon Echo Show experience.  You can't personalize this device to display the kind of content YOU want.  All the content is generalized.  You can't make this device show you any more personalized content than your next-door neighbor can.  It conveys generic news content at its best.You would think that after all these years, Amazon would have learned to make this a device that really works for you.  While you can go into the app and make traffic reports more personalized according to your work address, you really can't do anything more tailored to your needs.  Want specific news feeds or even your personal stock results updated on the screen?  You are completely out of luck.I have the Google Nest hubs as well.  I do like the Amazon ecosystem better, though there are some things that Google does better.  You can carry on a conversation with the Google Hubs.  You can't with Amazon.  You can use the hub with Nest cameras doorbells.  I can't do that with Amazon.  On the other hand, you can't view Ring cameras or doorbells on Google.  This fierce competition only serves to hurt the end-user who is forced to buy into both platforms to use all these devices.Where Amazon Echo and all its related devices clearly win is with the number of plug-ins available for it.  There are many really cool skills that you can add through the app to make Echo even more amazing.I really like the 8"" but overly disappointed that it's not designed as a bedside clock no matter what settings have already been suggested to use.  If I were new to these Echo devices and deciding upon the very first one I would want to purchase, I would go for the 10"" model -- especially if using cameras or showing off photos.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2019"

I wrongly assumed I would be able to at least see my smart home devices from the echo show screen and perhaps even turn lights on and off without having to use voice commands, but nope. Not even the most basic and obvious features were thought out for this garbage device. Seriously, for the same price you can get an echo dot, kindle fire, and a better-sounding Bluetooth speaker and would have MUCH more functionality available to you.If you don’t own a smart phone and want an overpriced clock that can also play muddied music and video from amazon’s library through a $15 subwoofer... then this is perfect for you.

If you want to view full screen photos without amazon marketing over at least 1/3 and often more than 1/3 of the screen you need to verbally tell Alexa every time you use it to display photos.  Apple are more expensive for a reason because the end user is not forced into how to customize the product.  One does get used to it a little but then it ends up coming full screen printed font over your favorite photo and it reminds you why amazon sells you the product for so little.Dear Amazon, please let the users change be homescreen settings to not include the Alexa suggestions, and also please do not contact me regarding this revied.  Change the firmware and then I will pull down the review.It’s a fun gadget and has a nice screen and good sound quality for its size, which is great for photos but you need to tell Alexa 20 times a day to display them manually if you want to see them fullscreen as it’s not a setting you can change.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2019"

48,Harrison J. Cross,I bought the Echo Show 8 thinking it would be a larger Echo Show 5... nope.,"  If, like me, you thought the Echo Show 5 was fine (minus one glaring issue I'll get into later) but simply wanted a larger display to be able to see the time and temp across the room easier and thought that the Echo Show 8 would be exactly that... save your money.For some unknown reason the developers at Amazon decided that the clock & temp display on the Echo Show 8 should only be able to take up a very small portion of the upper left-hand corner of the display.  This means that if you bought the Echo Show 8 to be able to see the clock easier due to it being larger you will actually get a smaller clock display.WuT?!Exactly.  Who at Amazon thought it would be a good idea to add code to limit the max size of the clock and temp on a device that costs more than the smaller version?  My eyes aren't even that bad but I can see how others with worse vision or possibly older people might prefer the larger display to be able to see the clock & temp better.  Bamboozled!In addition, the constant need to ""advertise"" to paying customers that's present on the Echo Show 5 also carries over on the more expensive Echo Show 8, sadly.  No matter what you do you can't fully disable everything that rotates on the home screen.  This means that you can't disable all of that garbage and just have the home screen be a clock and the temperature 24/7/365.  Even if you disable every option as well as the ""Rotate Continuously"" at the bottom you will still have your precious clock & temp minimize on a regular and constant basis while the stupid thing gives you ""pro tips"" of crap you can try saying.Amazon, how 'bout you give the users the option to FULLY and COMPLETELY disable this?!Enough people have complained about this and yet you persist on treating us like children.  Children with money to spend, mind you, but children nonetheless.  I don't need the hand holding that you seem to think we need.  I'm not huddled in a dark corner of my room shaking nervously frightened because I don't know how to ask Alexa to turn on a light.  You want to give new users a tutorial when they first set it up?  Fine.  This constant nagging that can't be disabled though is way, way, WAY too much.Enough people have hammered the reviews over exactly this on both devices and yet the solution has been ""coming soon"" for months.  This isn't a difficult change to implement if you really wanted to.I'm returning this Echo Show 8 due to these two reasons.  Awesome device (probably) if you can look past these issues I'm guessing.  I've already invested too much on three Echo Show 5's that I can't return so I'm not investing even more in an Echo Show 8 since it does the same BS only worse as those.If only Amazon was quicker to move on the simple requests of massive swaths of it's customers for one of their own products.

One reviewer said to go to home and clock then home content and then turn off Discovery. That's not quite correct for the ES8, that is how you get rid of the Try Alexa on ES5 not the 8. There is no Home and Clock, the 8 has a wallpaper and clock and right below that is the home content where you find discovery, and you can turn it off until you turn blue in the face, it will not cancel the Try Alexa. Maybe I have a different ES8 or Amazon posted the review for the wrong Echo Show. The second difference from the es5 is the clock. You have one setting.

I spent over 45 minutes talking to India and their techs who were very polite yet could not figure it out. My wife is legally blind and was so looking forward to this, as I had been hyping this feature for weeks. The second tech did however offer me a 15% discount on the Echo Show 10 which he assured me the feature would work. I can't send this back fast enough.

56,Anon,Needs improvement,"  Having used an echo 5 for about 6 months, I was waiting for Black Friday pricing so I could ""upgrade"" to an echo 8, and replace my clock radio and dot on the night stand with the echo 5, and use the echo 8 in the living room with the larger screen.  Thinking the two devices would share a common software/user interface, I only glanced at a few of the reviews, and mentally wrote the negative ones off as likely operator error.  That proves to be a mistake.On the positive side, the screen is nice, the sound is better than the echo 5, and build quality appears good.On the negative side, the echo 5's interface and feature set is more desirable to me. I dislike that unless I upload a picture, the backgrounds on the echo 8 will rotate through a set of them. I want one background, and for it to stay that way. I also don't like the tiny clock in the upper corner. I was expecting at least an option to have a large clock in the center like the echo 5 has (old eyes). And I agree the rotating 'try this"" on the bottom of the screen is extremely annoying, and should at least be an option to turn off.It does interact with my smart home devices as the echo 5 did, so it will at least function for the primary purpose it serves for me. While I would give the echo 5 a 4 star review, I give the echo 8 a 3 star rating because it's just ""meh"", when I really should be gushing about how it's like the echo 5 on steroids, and not a poorly implemented, sort of, almost, copy of it with a bigger screen.TLDR: the other reviews are real,  it's not just a bigger screened echo 5.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2019"
57,Jeremy Helling,"Eight generations and Alexa still constantly displays ""Things To Try""","  If you bought this hoping that Amazon finally listened to the tens of thousands of complaints about the annoying message of ""things to try"" randomly showing up - then do not buy this.I decided to buy this as a replacement for my Echo Spot as I went through several f those through the past couple of years because they all developed the video jittering and jumping issue - which was a chronic issue with the Spots.I was not keen on the 8"" screen because I have this device sitting on my desk where I sit 8-12 hours a day.  But I decided to buy this anyway because of the 1080 feature.  I have my Alexa network hooked to several cloud camera.

Amazon:  I really have zero desire to have you remind me that you know ninja jokes.  Really??? Some of us are older than 12.Another fault is there is no way to change the clock design or face as we were able to do on the Echo Spots.  There is only one option and that is a small digital clock in the upper left corner which uses maybe 10% of the screen.  I you have this device set up to display anything such as local weather or alerts you will also be notified with the horrible things to try headache.

58,JR,"Good, Bad and frustrated. Why no group video call tech or apps?!??","  Ok... here is the thing, I absolutely love my Alexa for so many reasons, the ease of use, the Apple Music integration, the funny weird questions you can ask and yes... especially the Samuel L Jackson’s voice on this thing! I mean, c’mon. You can set timers, look at recipes, listen to a podcast while you cook, even use it as an intercom with other devices under the same account. However... and dammit I did not not to leave a “however” review but, I’m sorry that you are not sorry...Alexa.So I convinced my Mother and Sister to each purchase one of these devices, (Echo 8), under some weird feels  false advertising guise that we would be able to have a group Alexa to Alexa video call on Thanksgiving. Simple enough right? Make sense. We each buy our own Alexa and call each other to enjoy a safe “time of the COVID” virtual family dinner.I bought one, my mother bought one and my sister bought one.. and today I found out my cousin bought one as well in an effort to be connected... again, thinking that we could either group call directly from our Alexa to Alexa, or, like literally every other device capable of video calling has done, be able to use either Zoom or FaceTime. Lies... totally nothing but false hope.Turns out that in a world where we are trying to stay safe and keep our community’s safe, there are still some devices that are not compatible to modern need. I mean, really?!? In the time of COVID, when we are all trying to adapt and technology like Zoom has made keeping connected that much more easy, Amazon feels behind.The whole reason... I’m serious.. the whole reason we bought this device was to be able to have a group virtual family thanksgiving dinner, where my mothers and sisters Alexa Show 8’s would let us have a video conference. Now, several hundreds of dollars later.. we just learned that not only can you ONLY call one contact at a time (sorry, no group calls). It also does not, (effectively or in any real workable way), function with Zoom/FaceTime or Skype.This.. my dear sweet Jeff Bezos feels behind the times. It’s Thanksgiving during a pandemic. Everyone wants to stay connected, and having no group video call option, app, or even Alexa to Alexa that are in separate  households and different accounts feels like it’s missing the Mark or missing the Steve (jobs). Get it? Because Apple has had group video calling in place for years, pre-pandemic. Feels like a missed opportunity.So do not be fooled by the weird and (honestly feels this way), manipulative advertising making it seem like the Alexa Show 8 can connect more than one device for a video call at a time.Will I still love my Alexa for other reasons.. yes... will I still have to rig up my MacBook or iPad for virtual Thanksgiving, using either Zoom or FaceTime???? Yup.. just a bummerAnd yes. We contacted customer support, googled, and researched any work around we could find to no avail. Customer service and tech support basically said “yeah... Alexa don’t do that”.So long story short, we love it for some reasons but feel burned for others.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2020"

60,Robert Wagner,"Not Good, but the ""Suggestions "" Are a Non-issue","  First impression - not impressed. There is much, much room for improvements with this device. I'll say that the ""suggestions"" at the bottom of the screen are a non-issue for us, I can't imagine why this bothers some people as much as it does. Frankly, I never notice them on my Fire TVs or this Echo. Pros are good sound, and everything as far as smart home device control goes. Having had an Echo in the house since the beta edition, we have added many bulbs and a thermostat that the Echo Show works well with. The cons are too many and too important. a) It has Hulu, but no Netflix. It is the only device I know of that can't get Netflix. The only video options it has are NBC (wow), Hulu, Food Channel if you pay for the service, Tubi and Prime video.  One out of 5 is not bad, would love to have more options there. b) The inability to add any apps. If I could put SlingTV on this, I wouldn't care about the Netflix. Adding Plex would give me access to my own server of content. c) YouTube looks awful. You can ask Alexa to do a YouTube search and you get all these tiny thumbnails in one column that runs down the left side while the majority of the screen is left unused, just white wasted space. I've tried both browsers and they both look like this. The YouTube app would help here. d) Fingerprints on the screen are VERY noticeable and take away from the picture quality. I believe that after any initial setting up I won't be touching it too much anyway. e) When I'm using the screen for viewing something and I tell Alexa to turn off a light, it goes to a very useless/annoying screen showing a light bulb with a slider next to it... and it stays there 15 seconds or so. Meanwhile, I'm missing my other thing I was watching. Why would it do this? I've obviously just displayed the fact that I can control the light with my voice, why would I now need a second option for the light adjustments for my finger?? This alone is a deal breaker!! f) So far, I have not been able access all of the content that I get on my Kindle. I push many recipes and other Docs to my Kindle and can see that content on any device that runs the Kindle app....until now. I can see my books, but not my Docs/Collections. Did not see that coming. Now for recipes I'm seeing that I need to sign up with AllRecipes.com and send recipes there to easily access them with the Echo Show.It seems to me, to get the most out of this, I need to conform to Amazon's way and not mine. Get an allrecpies account, sign up with Hulu. Or if I buy a Ring doorbell I can see a camera view. On my FireTV and Kindle tablets I am able to access all of my security cameras with the installation of a single app. I just received the Show yesterday and I will look to see if I can make this thing more useful for my needs, I honestly haven't spent that much time with it. Maybe I can find some answers to my concerns. In the past, while I'm in the kitchen, I have just stood my Kindle Fire 8 tablet on the counter, I'll probably go back to doing that. The tablet has more functionality, all the apps, all my Kindle content and and it's portable. I'm going to update this review in a couple of days. By then, I will have decided if the Show has to go.UPDATE: This thing is going back. I've tried what I would think should be simple tasks, it fails. I tried to setup an album in Prime photos for changing backgrounds. It's been on the same photo for several hours although the album has 209 photos in it. I say Play a Slideshow of that album or any album. It shows 4 or 5 pics and goes back to the home screen. Also, it appears there's no way to shuffle the albums - why not? Fire TVs allow the slideshows to shuffle. I tried to see my security cams using the Monocle skill. I can now call them up with Alexa on my Fire TVs, but not the Show. I looked further into the Allrecipes skill - it's the worst. As someone said it's better to have Alexa find recipes on the web.I have many Alexa enabled devices, but this by the far the most useless. Most of the positive reviews seem to be impressed with the things that need no screen - play music, control devices and lights. The screen has little to no functional use. Perhaps if this had been my first Alexa I would be more impressed. The show will have to go.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2019"

62,Raj,This is not your Google device,"  I decided to switch away from Google since they obviously have their own perception of reality with security and ownership of your data (not to mention their tilted view of the truth). So all my google devices went in the closet and I got all new Alexa stuff, ranging from multiple displays, Echo devices, door locks, therms, etc.Sadly, this is not at the Google level of automation. Amazon's choice in the way they add in skills is about as bad as I've seen. It's like modded Minecraft back in the alpha days. I can understand the desire to throw off development of their ecosystem to other developers - it's a lot of work to interface with stuff. Unfortunately, you get what you'd expect from every place out there trying to figure out how to interface up - a big mess. I'll use my Roomba vacuum as an example.  It's almost useless to think there's any integration happening. Around 70% of the time, it does not work. For example, Roomba like to come on and work right when I'm eating lunch, so you'd think I could just shout out to Alexa to pause the vacuum job. Well, that's wishful thinking. Sometimes it works, most of the time it doesn't understand what Roomba is. Same goes for my Samsung TV and some other devices.And then there's the mystery voice recognition. For the life of me, I can't figure out why Alexa thinks I'm saying the wake word. I could say something like ""My dog needs to eat."" and Alexa beeps and wakes up. It's like it needs to be sure to listen in on every possible word. Since their developers are so junior apparently, we only get a small handful of wake up words. It must be really complicated to be able to interpret everything I'm saying once the device is listening compared to just setting my own wake up word. I'd set it to ""Hey Google"" if I could because that apparently didn't trigger near as many false times.So, if you want to play around some some Alexa stuff, it's ok. It's not where I'd hoped it was. I'm not as worried [yet] about Amazon using all my data as I am with google, so it's a rock and a hard spot deciding who you can trust.

63,Larry,Buy the Echo Show 5 Instead,"  IMHO, the Echo Show 5 (FIVE) is the best all-around Echo device you can buy. It is my bedside alarm clock, and so much more. Amazon hit it out of the park with the FIVE, and I couldn't be happier.But this review isn't about the FIVE. It's about the Echo Show 8 (EIGHT), and in this case, Amazon clearly struck out.The EIGHT should have been a larger version of the FIVE. Doing so would have made up for the one area where the FIVE is somewhat lacking--sound quality. But no, Amazon decided to go off in a different direction with the EIGHT, and in doing so, made a mess of what could have been an amazing device.Is the EIGHT a good clock? No. Most of the time, the clock is shoved into the upper left-hand corner of the screen, using about 10% of the available screen space. You absolutely cannot read the time unless you are less than two feet away from the device. When the device is in night mode, the clock is shoved into the lower left-hand corner of the screen, and is about twice as large, which means you can be about four feet from the device to read the time. As a clock, the EIGHT is a complete failure.Does the EIGHT play videos? Yes; however, I have a TV, a laptop, and an iPad. If I want to watch a video, I'm going to use one of those devices.Does the EIGHT play music? Yes, and the sound is almost as good the original Echo (almost), which I still have and still use. It displays track information while playing. In some cases, it also displays lyrics. If that's important to you, it's a plus. You can also connect this to external speakers through a patch cord or Bluetooth, but if you do that, the value of the EIGHT is diminished.Is the EIGHT a digital frame? Well, it could be. It tries to be. The picture is beautiful, to be sure. It's nice to see rolling images, either stock or your own, in beautiful high-resolution color. Unfortunately, the view is interrupted by the clock in the upper right-hand corner (not a big deal) and the ever-present ""try this"" at the bottom. BTW, are digital frames even a thing anymore?I read the reviews before purchasing this, so I knew what I was getting into. But it was stupid cheap, and I couldn't pass it up at the holiday deal price, so what the heck.All things considered, the EIGHT could be great...it just isn't. Amazon blew it. It is my least favorite device and, quite frankly, not worth the price, even on sale.I'm not going to return it for two reasons. First, I knew what I was getting when I bought it, so I can't say I'm disappointed. My expectations were already low. Second, Amazon has a way if improving their devices, and the EIGHT is still relatively new in the line-up. I have expectations that Amazon will hear consumer feedback and make changes to the EIGHT that make it more like the FIVE, which is what it should have been in the first place.If you haven't purchased an EIGHT yet, don't. Get the FIVE instead. You will be far happier, especially if you want the device as a clock.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2019"

65,Capt CMK,"As of 12/9/19, Reviews stating Things to Try can be removed are WRONG!","  12/9/19I ordered the Show 8 based on reviews that said the ""Things to Try"" chryon could be disabled via the settings menu. As it turns out, that was incorrect information as has now been confirmed by Amazon customer support, as well as my own personal experience. I hope Amazon will listen to their customers and offer an option to disable this device behavior. Similar to an unsubscribe or opt-out of email setting, Amazon could offer a frequency option  (turn off, once a month, weekly, daily, hourly, on continuously). This one behavior truly ruins an otherwise good experience. If this is corrected, this device would earn 4-5 stars no question.Pros: Good sound, bright display, nice form factor, looks nice on the kitchen counter where I have it placed. Nice to have lyrics display while music is playing, local content is appreciated, good microphones, and I like the ability to see my cameras in the screen and the ability to view my home automation control (browser), physical camera shutter for privacy.Cons: Inability to turn off ""Things to Try"" is annoying, the optional stand should be less expensive, it could use more user options for what is displayed and how, and with Amazon having their own Silk browser, we should be able to at a minimum use voice to launch the browser with a saved bookmark.

66,Gd-BH,A must have home device!!,"  I was so excited to receive my package in 3 days due to my prime membership.Once I unwrapped it, it was an easy setup.  All I had to do was plug it in and follow the on-screen instructions (i.e. logging into Wi-Fi)...I like that I have this item along with 3 echos drops which allows me to ""drop in""- a tool that can be used as an intercom for the house.  Unfortunately, im not always heard clearly.  I have taken full advantage of prime video and Hulu which plays clearly and the sound is entirely louder and crisper than I ever expected. I love the the built in Alexa.  Although, sometimes she responds to an unknown question.  Note: speak at a speed fast enough for Alexa to understand.  Any hestitation will cause Alexa to disregard your question.  Another note... You can call different devices by 5 different preselected names (Alexa, Echo, computer, and others).I really enjoy using this device in my bathroom as a tv and or video player.  When you play music from Prime Music the lyrics are displayed on the screen.There are many more skills that I have yet to review...l recommend watching some you tube videos or handbook to be sure you discover more of what the Echo 8 offers.  I know you can set reminders, conduct calls and more!!  I wish it allowed me to view Spectrum TVI can't wait to find more discoveries!Fyi... Download the Alexa app on your mobile phone.  My children can call me from the echo 8 while im at work. Lastly, Ring works well with this device..

68,Rowandsprocket,Echo Show 8 with Blink Mini,"  I ordered this to use as a baby monitor system for our toddler. We already had Blink outdoor cameras that we love so I thought this would work well in addition to those. I don't like that the camera can't just stay on live view on the Echo Show. Maybe I just haven't figured out how to adjust that setting but it seems to me if I have live view on the Blink Mini that neither of our outdoor cameras are able to be viewed at the same time from another device. I changed all the settings so it would pop up as live view if our daughter stood up or moved but did not get an alert until I actually went in the next morning to get her out of bed even though she was already standing and moving around. I will adjust the sensitivity again to the highest it will go and see if that helps. Otherwise, this should be a great combo!

69,RD,AMAZING!!!,"  Hands down, this is by far the best item I have ever purchased for myself on Amazon.I was in desperate need of replacing my alarm clock on my nightstand, so I decided to go with the Echo 8 over the Echo 5. I purchased an Echo 5 as well, which will replace my Echo dot in my kitchen where I have less space, but this is about the Echo 8.I am absolutely amazed at the sound quality for starters. This Alexa packs exceptional sound quality into it's small design. I have a subscription to Sirius XM which I have synced to play through Alexa and I am extremely impressed with the balance of the bass and treble.The screen resolution is very nice for the photo displays. You can sync an assortment of photos through the Amazon Photo app or select a category for the Echo 8 to display for you. I have not tried to watch a video yet, but with the 8"" screen it would be very easy to enjoy and much more enjoyable than trying to view on your mobile device.  The Echo 8 is actually small enough to use on a nightstand and it has a night mode which will only show the clock on a dark screen. If you have a large room like I do, I would highly recommend the Echo 8. When I turned the volume up all the way it literally made me jump while I was sitting on my bed. This is one beefy little box, that is quite amazing. It's also very easy to sync all smart plugs, lights and devices to this groovy new Alexa. I cannot recommend this highly enough!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2019"
70,J. D. Hyde,Don't Buy it for Grandma if She Doesn't Have a Smartphone!,"  Love the product.  Bought one for myself and it works so well that we bought another for my wife's 91 year old mother.  Unfortunately, it is 100% impossible to configure this thing for communications (i.e. making video calls) because 91 year old mom doesn't have a smartphone (how many over-90s do you know that DO have smartphones)?  When we ran into this problem, I configured Echo Show using my wife's smartphone.  Everything seemed to work OK until we discovered that all of Mom's calls appear to be coming from my wife (because we set it up using my wife's smartphone number).  Not only that, but our other relatives can't call Mom on her Echo Show because Amazon doesn't recognize that she has an Echo Show (again because it's not associated with her smartphone BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T HAVE ONE)!  I called Amazon Customer Support.  She explained to me that Amazon must verify the phone number by sending a text message with a one-time-code.  I told her I understood this, and asked if it would be possible to instead call my mother-in-law on her non-smartphone and read her a one-time code that she could then relay to me (just like she would do if they COULD text her a code).  Armed with this magic code, I could then assign her non-smart phone number to her Echo Show and the problem would be solved - VOILA!  I realize that we would still have to use our smartphones to make any future configuration changes to Mom's device, but that's OK because she wouldn't do it even if she did have a smartphone.  Unfortunately, Amazon Customer Support says no-can-do the simple phone call solution - no explanation why.  Their suggestion was to buy mom a smartphone solely for this purpose.  So now you know: Product = 5 stars.  Customer Service = 0 star.

There are no controls that allow me to improve the quality of the photos as they appear on the Show's screen.  While the quality of whats displayed is very disappointing, even more annoying is the fact that there is a text line toward the bottom of the screen announcing things for you to try on your Alexa device.  I feel like I've purchased an on going commercial for Alexa.

74,Jai-Me,"Was Great - Now full of Ads & ""Helpful Hints""  AVOID - AVOID until fixed","  We have been loyal for years, enjoying our photo collection.  Now the display is saturated with ""Alexa for your Day"" and other messages to ""Try"" this or that.The display used to rotate through our Amazon Photo library, either all or any ONE folder.  Alexa also has nice integration with Google Calendar and weather.  Recently, every few minutes there is an ""Alexa for your Day"" advertisement that stays up for a longer time period than individual photos are displayed.

""Alexa tell me where i can get a pizza"" really? Just stop, its visual pollution. You can not turn the damn things off. Total intentional bad design. Theres a reddit called a___ole design and the alexa team should get a gold statue from them.And the other thing is that alexa seems to wax and wain in terms of her comprehension , she was really ""getting it "" and understanding most things I asked for in dec 2019 and then mid month I think they did an update and she got... well I'm sorry it's not a mean word because I'm using it in the proper use... she got retarded.

76,Sherlonda,The device I want so badly to love but am starting to loathe,"  The Echo Show 8 should have been a slam dunk easy win for Amazon but it seems they just can't get out of their own way.  The flaws in interface are becoming annoying to the point of distraction.  Luckily this is something that is easily remedied by Amazon, if they simply listen to their customer base.  My primary use for this is smart home integration, lights and camera system, married to the Ring ecosystem.  That's where my review becomes a tale of two halves.Smart home integration - 4/5 - This it does really well (will explain the 1 star loss below).  Given that Ring is owned by Amazon, this should come as no surprise.  I'm able to easily and quickly bring up a camera and not only live view but also voice communicate over it.  It's exactly what I need.  Working from home, setup in my office, I can see and talk to whomever comes to the front door.  I can also bring up the patio camera and see/talk to the wife/kids/pet in and around the pool.  With the right components I can change the temp, adjust the lights and control smart enabled devices I've purchased with capable of Alexa integration.  Love every part of this.Alexa interface - 1/5 - This is why I'm so disappointed.  This sits on my desk in the office and when I'm not using it, my expectation is that it is a time/day/temp clock with a pretty background picture.  It kind of is, except when Amazon feels like sales pitching/promoting something.  Which is more often than not.  The screen flashes to that what essentially becomes a popup ad, which I catch from the corner of my eye, while I'm working.  Now I've gone in to Settings -> Home Content -> turned off everything, including Rotate Continuously.  While that has cut down a lot of the home screen spam, Amazon is forcing something called ""Alexa for your day"" and it seems to have no shutoff option.  There are other missing settings that simply shouldn't be missing from a controllable interface like the Show.Feedback/Suggestions/Fixes1.  Smart home integration - The missing star is because while the Show/Ring have a really nice integration, they just stopped short of making it something that could have been extraordinary.  We need a Ring dashboard screen for the Show.  Something like the live camera view of a NVR.  Maybe allowing users to touch on a box and bring that camera up to full screen view before dropping back to tiles of all the cameras.  Amazon owning both companies should be able to program the API for that and it would elevate the Echo Show from an optional addition, to an ""essential"" component of the Ring ecosystem.2.  Home Screen -  Kill the suggestions/hints/tips/promotion stuff.  We own the product, we're invested in the Amazon ecosystem, save the spam for someone else.  This isn't a demo model in a brick and mortar store.  While disabling everything under Home Content, we're still getting stuff like ""Alexa for your day"".  While it does cuts down on clutter on the Home Screen, it should cut out all the clutter.  When people say it's not as bad, as a desk clock, it's still a distracting eye sore.  Clock, day, time and a beautiful background... speaking of which.3.  Missing background setting - Where is the option to control the background settings?  I'm told the background (non-photo) pictures rotate every 10 minutes.  In reality, the Show seems to do them whenever it feels like it.  It may scroll through some as quick as 30 seconds before settling on one for 10 minutes.  This setting should be in the menu.  We should have the ability to control how often that background changes.  It should be a ""Never change"" to a 1-24 hour selection, or something similar.  Give us the ability to set it.  It should be customizable the way a pc desktop is, only have what I want to see, how I want to see it.4.  Clock - The Show 5 allows for a large centered clock.  Why isn't this an option for the 8?  This is just baffling and might be the single most requested thing I've seen across forums and reviews.  The API cannot be that hard.  The Show is an end table clock, a desk clock, even a kitchen clock when not actively being used.  It's okay, that's what people want it to be.My mom used to say, sometimes you help best when you stay out of the way.  Well, Amazon stay out of your own way.  The Echo Show 8 should be the ultimate executive assistant.  Quiet and unobtrusive, sitting on corner of my desk until I interact with it.  Instead you've deliberately chosen it to be the annoying temp that keeps trying to be ""helpful"" with suggestions and popups.  Look at the reviews, forums, notice people know what they want from the device.  Ditch the dystopian future ad spam trope and make the interface clean and elegant and most importantly, user driven.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 2, 2021"

On the echo five, there is a set of very attractive clock faces that can be chosen, but on this unit you can only choose a category such as art, travel etc. The echo will then choose random clock faces from that category to display. I would very much prefer having the ability to choose a clock face and stay on that one as opposed to having the unit choose various faces for me. For example on the echo show five there is an attractive nature scene with a lot of greenery and I would love to be able to put that same picture on the echo eight, but it’s unavailable.Additionally, we need a full screen clock option. Having a huge screen and relegating the clock to a small corner is not going to work for many of us.Other than these missing options it’s a winner, and I hope they will change the software soon to be able to allow for better clock face and display choices",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2019"

81,Jim Donnelly,I feel like Amazon is really starting to not care about its customers...,"  I generally don't write reviews, and I used to love my Show 8. I bought one for my home office and one for my parents. It used to do pretty much everything I could ask for or wanted... All I wanted was a device to display pictures of my family to make it easy for my parents to see the latest, since they live in another state, and haven't seen them since their grandkids since they were born. It was a bonus that we had it show weather and we could do video calls...But No!!!.... AMAZON HAD TO DESTROY THE EXPERIENCE WITH THEIR 3/2021 UPDATE BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO SHOEHORN ""ALEXA FOR YOUR DAY"" IN EVERY USER'S FACE!!!....I've been a loyal customer for a long time. My family spends a good chunk of our wallet share at Amazon. We ordered the Show 10 as soon as it was available... I was hoping they would remove this feature or at least turn down the frequency. It literally pops up every 5 screen. Instead, Amazon spread it to the Show 8, and I'm assuming the Show 5. I get you want to share the same UI i.e. the Weather is the same on the 10 as 8 now, but less one pane, but you can't give us the option to turn this Alexa for your Day ""feature"" off??? Who is the executive that loves this that will be so heartbroken if it's removed??.... Seriously, I tried thinking of why this is happening and that's the only logical reason I can think of why you'd want to irritate so many customers just to keep a feature that's not even helpful. There is no value in the information on the screen, and most of it is redundant. Most of us have other Echo devices... It's not new information that you can make a call with it or play music...You could make these devices so useful if you give your customers more control. After all, it's our device, not yours. My parents are elderly. All you are doing is confusing them before they just got to enjoy pictures of their grandkids...I've been in contact with Amazon about this, but so far there's been no action. I welcome escalating to whomever I need to because this is ridiculous. ""Alexa for your Day"" totally cheapens the experience to the point where it makes it feel like a store model that has a boring loop that states benefits we already know. I don't need that for my home. I already bought it. If I need tips, I'll turn them on/off as needed.Most high end devices Amazon makes and sells I'll buy in second... I was prepared to outfit more of my house with the Show 10 for example. What they are doing with the ""Alexa for your Day"" feature is antithetical to the philosophy of company I've studied for over 15 years. It will give me pause if their new stance is to force feed its users ""tips."" I may have to reconsider Google's hub.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2021"
82,tommyg,Show vs Nest - I now have both,"  Ok I’m not a highly knowledgeable person when it comes to tech, but I’m not a novice either. I actually bought the Show 8 and the Google Nest Hub at the same time because they were priced the same. I figured I would keep the better of the two. Nest arrived first so I set it up first. Setup was incredibly easy (I already have a nest mini), eventually easier than the Show. I also have a gmail account so that speeds up things on the Nest as well. I wasn’t keeping my photos on Google but it was pretty quick to add favorites in one folder and the Nest is now a digital photo frame. I have it on my nightstand because when you turn out the lights it really does go dark as well with a hint of the time showing - in full screen size. I am VERY sensitive to light at night and this doesn’t bother me at all. I also really like the “good morning” routine that you set up in the Nest better than the Show. It’s simple enough to ask and get info right before walking out the door.Once the Show arrived I did the setup thinking it would be easy as I have 3 dots and an Echo already. So yeah, setup went ok until you explore thinking ALL the reviews are wrong and you CAN turn off the “try this” feature. The answer is NO, you can’t. I have every part that should turn it off switched to off (even on the app). Constant “try this” on the screen. It’s ALWAYS there. And there is a list of what seems like a 100 “cards” so it never runs out. The software must’ve changed because all of the offered suggestions to turn it off aren’t accurate for what is currently possible. If you don’t care about that/wouldn’t bother you, then choose the unit that dominates your home or the website you use the most.So which is better? Meh, they’re about the same IMO. My sons and I usually have them compete with each other to see which one can answer a question accurately or with the best info. Lately there’s no clear winner on that, but Google is usually easier to understand. The Show does NOT go completely dark at night so I could never have it on my nightstand and the clock is never full screen so that’s annoying too. I have added a seasonal photo image on my amazon photo account using a computer so it’s decorative in the living room. I’m going to be installing a video doorbell myself soon and some interior cameras so I’ll update my review when those gadgets are added to compare use.

85,Nick,like having an assistant,"  To assist with the kiddo's remote learning, I needed a few things so we did not miss a beat. A clock, a timer, and an assistant to remind me about things! I began by browsing for the first two, as the last one seemed an impossibility. I saw different timers, felt that ones with large displays would be preferable. For the clock, we needed one whose display adjusts with the lighting so it didn't bother you at night and gradually got brighter to help you wake up in the morning. I've always wanted to have Alexa, but it seemed like a luxury and something to look into down the line. This device showed up in my searches and when I considered the combined prices of my preferences for the clock and timer, this was looking a lot more affordable. Plus, it met or surpassed the features I was looking for. Anytime I need to be reminded about something, I just ask Alexa. Seems to allow unlimited alarms and reminders. Still trying to learn all of the features and display options. Love the sleep sounds, better alternative to the dark screen videos we were playing at night. I'm very satisfied with this purchase and haven't even scratched the surface of what it can do.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2020"
86,E Lacy,Some fatal flaws detract from the experience,"  Small changes could make this product so much better, and one big one could make it the must-have device of the decade. My extended family has a mix of iPhone and Android devices and was looking for an easy video calling option. It is ok for one to one calling, but otherwise does not work for us. Most problems could be addressed by software updates.Positives:Video quality on calls is good, even in somewhat dim indoor lighting.Sound quality is also good on a call, certainly better than your phone's speaker.Once contacts are setup, placing a call is easy.Negatives:You can't manually add a contact on the Echo Show device itself. You have to do so on the Alexa app on your phone, which defeats the purpose of getting one for your non-techy relative who is uncomfortable using a phone app. If they have to use the Alexa app on their phone, you might as well standardize your family on Zoom, Whatsapp, or another service.You can't just setup an ""account"" with an email address--you need a cell phone number--so it isn't viable as a smart phone alternative. I know there are workarounds, but none of them seem viable to pull off remotely. Amazon has an opportunity to create an ""echosystem"" for its customers, but it  hasn't done so yet. Here's what they need to do:  Amazon Prime members should be able to create profiles for all members in the household, each of which can have an Echo account. You should then be able to add any Prime member as a contact, whether or not they have a smart phone. Non-Prime users can already be added with a smart phone number.Three way calling isn't a current feature. Amazon has announced this as a feature to be added, but the fact that you can't have a video conference with other Echo Show devices is a major dealbreaker. Really, Amazon, you couldn't get video conferencing on this by now?The above can be done with a software update, but the last two problems are hardware related.First, there is no internal battery, so you can't unplug this while you're on a call. Even an hour battery life would be good. Heck, 10 minutes would be sufficient to let you move around a bit during a call.The viewing and camera angles are fixed at an upward angle. It is designed to be placed on a table or desk with the user sitting in a chair.  If you want to have a call between your child and grandma, it is quite difficult with this device. This could be mostly fixed with an adjustable stand. There is one available, but it doesn't let you adjust the angle nearly enough--the camera can't point down at all, just level with the surface the Echo is sitting on.This was a gift, so I'm keeping it. But I wouldn't buy one right now knowing all its faults. The few software updates above would be enough to put me over the top, and the hardware features I mentioned would make this a really solid product.  I realize that creating the ""echosystem"" that I'm talking about is a lot more complicated than it seems, but this is what's needed to make the Echo Show a must-have.  While I'm dreaming, why not take the next step and add social networking features, which are sort of already there with photo-sharing? Since Prime is a membership fee based ecosystem, this could be a service where the user isn't the product.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2021"
87,E Lacy,Incredibly disappointed with Alexa and Fire TV integration,"  EDIT: Just when you think it can't get worse... It does. I was cooking dinner tonight and had a timer set. Once the timer was up, I said, 'Alexa, stop' and then tried about 15 other different variations of this. Alexa thought I had no timers set on any devices and the timer continued to sound until I had to unplug the device and plug it back in.Also, yesterday while watching TV, I randomly started to experience some incredibly noticeable sound distortion on my Fire TV stick 4k. Once again, after trying every other possible solution, I had to restart the device....ORIGINAL REVIEW:Incredibly disappointed. This was one of EIGHT Fire TV and/or Echo devices that I purchased on Black Friday, hoping to switch from Roku TV and have a seamless smarthome experience. Oh boy, was I wrong.Whether I rename the the Fire TV devices or use their original names, the echo devices CANNOT control or recognize the tv devices, even after properly pairing them under the TV & Video setting in the Alexa app. I've tried to unpair, repair, restart, unregister, reregister, you name it. I've wasted days.  Generally, Alexa responds with 'I cannot find a device named ...' I consider myself very technically savy and I'm positive this is not something that I'm doing wrong. I should've read more into this before buying. TONS of people all over the internet are having this problem. It's infuriating. Plain and simple, until problems like this are fixed, Amazon is blaintantly false advertising the way that their devices work.Other cons to note:-Multiple video apps stutter and sometimes even randomly pause without ever resuming unless you physically resume them.-Alexa drastically lowers the volume of the TV when you are voicing a command. This in-and-of-itself is not a huge problem. However, it becomes a problem often when after the command is complete, Alexa does not resume the original volume of the content. When this has happened, I've had to ask Alexa to turn the volume back up to the specific number it was at.-I have two third generation echos paired as a stereo system for the TV. Often, even though I have my fire TV set as the preferred device, only the echos hear my voice, and once again, because they cannot control the TV, they say that they cannot recognize the device and then I just have to pick up the controller anyway.-The Fire TV will often think that it hears an 'Alexa' when absolutely no where near that word has been stated. Because the volume lowers drastically when Alexa is listening, it creates an obnoxious volume dip in content to listen for nothing when this happens.-You cannot set a sleep timerHonestly I could go on and on about the cons and about just how unhappy I am about these products. There are even more problems than what I listed here, but I'm not wasting too much breath, as after doing days and days of research on these topics, I've seen that Amazon has absolutely no answers to these problems, even after thousands of people have reported the same problems over and over. Unless there is some revalatory software updated coming, I'll be returning hundreds of dollars of equipment.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2019"

89,Bradford,"Intermittent, does not integrate well, annoying messages","  I'm all-in on Echo devices -- have more than 10 Echo devices.  This one is likely being returned.  Here is why:- Consistently loses signal for music.  the main reason I have so many devices is for music.  the Dots are more reliable.  This often needs restart, and interrupts the ""Play everywhere"". Music just stops. or it never starts.- Poor voice recognition - does not work as well as dots or 2nd Gen echo on hearing and understanding voice.  (it is in the same location  where used to have a 2nd Gen Echo)- Annoying / useless suggestions at the bottom - I have no use for them.  they suggest things I'll never do or already know how to do.  Waste of screen space.  At least have an option to turn off.  You'll see this is a VERY common complaint.- Not very intelligent / useful screen selections - seldom has what I need, slow to show what I ask, etc.- New(?) notification - not long after I started using this, I started getting alert tones and all the echo devices in my house would have a yellow ring.  That means I have a notification.  when i check the notification, it's often something I don't want or is not helpful.  Today it was asking me to review a purchase I made weeks ago.  If it is going to do that for every purchase, it will be nonstop because I buy a lot.  When I said ""Alexa, never show me this again"", it babbled on about not being able to do that, I needed to log in blah, blah, etc.  Just to not do what I never asked it to do.- Unable to stereo pair with other speaker devices -- Even Dot's do this.  I'm better off replacing with Dots... will have better sound in a large room.what it is useful for:- showing my full shopping list when asked- showing me my security cameras.  Though there is a delay, so it's only marginally better than using phone.- (maybe) showing the song and artist of music playing.  i say ""maybe"", as it's not really that useful.That's about it.Overall, I don't see the value in the Show, it performs worse than simpler devices, and is annoying.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 24, 2020"

After researching the issue, I found that many other people felt the same way.I’m also on the ‘get rid of the Try Alexa banner on the bottom’ bandwagon.I’m generally happy with Amazon in general, and its products in particular, so I’m hoping that leaving a one star review might get someone’s attention so that they can do a simple software update to make this happen.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2021"

92,Lou,Couple things really bug me..,"  Have to say I had higher expectations.  Will break down my review in a few parts noting that I have technically not received the product yet, however I did see the stand and played around with it at the Amazon store.  Here are a few things that bug me:1) Amazon's website says the item is out of stock and will take 2 weeks to deliver.  That's fine, until I drive 5 minutes to an Amazon store where they have piles of boxes of the Echo show 8 in both colors.  Why would Amazon's online store be out of stock when they have so many in stock so close by??2) The stand is REALLY not worth 20+ dollars.  I purchased as part of the bundle and still feel ripped off.  It doesn't swivel left and right, only goes up and down in a very uncomfortable way.  Honestly, the fact that it's a $20 piece of plastic that you absolutely need for this device to be visible is insane and Amazon is better than this.I will add more notes when I get a chance to review the functionality in more depth, on the surface it seems OK.

The main reason I purchased this echo was to have an easy way to pull up my recipes while cooking. The description says you can use the All Recipes skill, however they made it so you can’t sync to your All Recipes account. This makes it a pretty useless skill. I did find that there is a Sous Chef Recipe skill that is fairly basic looking, but easy to use.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2019"
95,Queen_bee,It performs as advertised.,"  Having already owned an Echo Dot for several years and being familiar with its eccentricities, the Echo Show 8 was purchased to be a monitor for my Ring Camera as well as all the features of Alexa.  If you're planning on acquiring one be sure to get the not included magnetic stand.  It's around $20 or so recommended for the Show device.  I don't know why Show did not include one with the device.  Otherwise the device sits on the counter with a slight backwards tilt, no adjustment.  The stand allows much greater movement and viewing angles.The sound from the speakers is excellent and I would have given it a 5 star rating instead of only 4.  Due to the design of the device the speakers are on the back, firing backwards.  Of course you can hear it from the front but not as good as if you stand behind it.  Actually the Dot had a better sound dispersal than the Show.  But I didn't buy it for audio entertainment.  As I'm moving about the house doing chores or such I simply tell Alexa to play Pandora radio.  Wonderful sound to be sure but...depends on how picky you are about such.  Otherwise it integrated immediately (pleasantly surprised!) so the Dot moved to my bedroom.  Though Dot cannot show me what the Ring camera sees it will alert me aloud that movement has been detected; my Fitbit does not.  Very good for waking me at night as something outside is moving about.  So I pick up my cell phone, open the Ring app and see what's up outside.  The Show will do just that:  Show you what your Ring (probably other camera brands as well, not sure) camera sees.  Just say ""Alexa show me the front door"" (or whatever location you designate) and it does.  I can also communicate through the Show device with the Ring camera.  Love it!  As for the rotating Alexa messages as many are complaining about, yes they are there.  Personally I'm not bothered in the least but I understand their gripe and agree there should be more flexibility in display setting.  There may be I just haven't been that concerned.NOTE:  For some reason Fitbit does not pair with Ring.  If my Ring camera alerts Alexa will tell me.  Fitbit does nothing.  Due to age and hearing loss I depend greatly on Fitbit notifying me of alerts.  It will alert me my phone is ringing, there is a text, etc.  Apparently this a Fitbit problem though they will not admit such.  Though there are workarounds out there I am not experienced enough to go changing and/or writing code.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2020"

97,Geo,No Music While Using Web Browser,"  I purchased this to use in the kitchen. If that is your intention, you need to know that the All Recipes Skill is utter garbage. There is absolutely no way for you to link your account so you won’t have access to your personal or saved recipes. Instead they will give you a few options to choose from. That’s useless to me. I finally figured out a way to access my personal recipes by using the web browser instead of using a skull. This would have been a minor inconvenience that I could live with except for one major issue. The Echo Show won’t play music and allow you to use the web browser at the same time. I always listen to music while cooking so this is an absolute deal breaker for me. It blows my mind that Amazon would design such a limited device as this when the top use of their devices is streaming music. This device doesn’t meet our needs in the least. I guess I will go back to using a tablet to look at my recipes while streaming music over a Dot. What a shame. I really thought Amazon was better than this.

100,Savory Stage,Much less than I was hoping for,"  I was quite surprised to find this device to be mediocre.  Alexa is not as good at voice recognition as Siri, and Alexa seems to have less sophistication in recognizing slightly different ways of giving her commands.  For example, after a timer I’ve set has gone off, I have to say “Alexa, stop.”  If I say “Alexa, stop the timer” or “Alexa, stop timing,” she won’t understand what I’m trying to say.I was hoping to use the Echo Show 8 as a digital slide show of our grandchildren.  That’s easy to set up as a screensaver, but for any photo in portrait mode, rather than using monochromatic vertical left and right bars (say, black or grey), the vertical bars are a smorgasbord of colors taken from the image being displayed (it looks something like a washed out, faint version of the photo with a semi-transparent grey on top).But for me, the real deal killer is all of those (un)helpful “tips” that Alexa displays on the screen when it is in screensaver mode. It’s one thing to have those when one is using, say, a FireStick, because one doesn’t spend that much time on the screensaver, but with the Echo Show, it will be in screensaver mode most of the time.Not worth the cost, even when on sale.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2020"
101,Oleg,Software isn't ready for prime time,"  The main complaint is the apps just don't work. Hulu TV gives an error message. I signed up for Food Network TV so that I could use one of the Show 8's in the kitchen, but it has no ability to do any of the live shows. It's sorta like Samsung and Apple TV's Food Network app, just some old recorded shows. Overall, it's just a larger screen that has Alexa and tells time, weather, etc. Touchscreen doesn't seem to work as well as the Show 5. I wonder if the largest Show has a glass screen. That might be why it's so expensive. The 1MP camera doesn't bother me as I don't use the video chat feature as I usually just use FaceTime. Sound is a bit better than the 5.UPDATE: I used the Amazon Trade-in Program where they give you X amount of money for an older Alexa device so long as your device isn't cracked. I traded in a Dot. The trade in amount was a mere $5. When they got it, they appraised it at $2 so I only got $2. I wasn't expecting that. My friend traded in his Echo. They told him it'd be $25. They sent it back to him without explanation and they kept his power supply. He spent 40 minutes on the phone being transferred to 3 people to finally get a resolution. Long story short. They do not explain why they refuse items or lower your value.

107,Kendra F,Unreliable hardware - not suitable for checking in on aging loved ones,"  With COVID, we wanted a device we could easily use to drop in and check up on our mother-in-law. The echo show seemed like the perfect solution with the drop-in capabilities and being able to easily initiate a video call - sadly the device is unreliable. Reliability is a big deal when it comes to checking in on loved ones who are older and more frail. Being unable to see whether they're there, or passed out on the floor is a deal-breaker.What started off as a great solution quickly became a nightmare as the camera suddenly stopped working for no apparent reason. We can still drop-in, but not with video - which is ironic for a device that's advertised as a video solution. We attempted multiple hardware resets, reviewed all of the settings, but with no success.If you have loved ones who live in different states and are planning to use Alexa Show to monitor their health and keep in touch with them, you may wish to research other products with better reliability and hardware / software design.

You do have to do some learning where to find things like your music and movie/tv playlists, internet, etc.  But honestly, when it comes down to it, all you have to do is tell Alexa what you want and she will assist.  It literally takes any type of typing needed away.  I wanted the internet and all I have to say is ""Alexa, open Silk"" and there is the internet that you all know with the search bar/address bar up top and when you want to look for something, hit the search bar and up comes a keyboard.  You just need to know what to say.  People have complained about the pop-ups that say ""Try this"" and ""Try that"", but honestly, I actually kind of like it.  Alexa has suggested many things that I would not have thought of and they are quite interesting.  Lastly, people have complained about how this MUST be PLUGGED in to power it.  That was a very big con for me, but I got around it by buying a battery pack (Skull Candy Fat Stash, about the size of a deck of cards $40) and BiXPower USB Port Power Cable with 4 Extra Popular Interchangeable Connector Tips.

112,Bob R,Undercooked,"  I am very disappointed by a few facts:1) there is no way to watch Netflix on this. Since I watch Netflix on Fire TV stick, I assumed I can watch it here. Wrong assumption!!2) the clock display can not be customized. The time is shown in the left bottom quadrant. Very strange design decision3) No much customization of the user interface is allowed.4) Youtube can be watched (thank's god!), but only in the browser5) Annoying ""try alexa.."" add scrolling through my screen.Summarizing:This is not a tablet. You can not run apps on it.It is not a secret that Amazon ecosystem is weak. It is not even close to Apple's and Google's ones.  I liked the fact that Amazon allowed side loading apps onto their fire phone and fire tablet. Nothing like this here. You only deal with what Amazon allows you to deal with.Somehow, it reminds me about the failure of the Windows RT paradigm.Greed is what drives this world. Here we are not getting the best possible experience, but rather what the company wants to sell us to maximize its profit.I am at the verge, thinking weather to keep or to return it.

113,Cam-WA,Just right!,  I have the show 5 which is a nice bedroom sized device or in my case under the TV in the den. I like it because the clock fills the display and its easy to see across the living room. I actually purchased the Show 8 for my bedroom. I was concerned the time only showing in the bottom corner would be a problem but its really not. Would I prefer the whole screen to show the time? Yes but the numerals are big enough to see over several feet without any issues even when I'm not wearing glasses. I bought the show 8 because I wanted better and fuller stereo sound and for the size this delivers nicely. I like that I can tell Alexa to show me the front doorbell camera when I'm in the bedroom! I'd say this is the most perfect Echo device I have overall. I also have the Sonos speakers with integrated alexa and they do not accept commands as well as the Amazon made echo devices. The display is very clear when it rolls through my photos. I like that it dims at night and just shows the time with a blank background so that it doesn't light up the bedroom.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2020"
114,Mark,Dangerous equipment,"  Alexa is not even AI. Its engine is not socialist. Alexa is a straight up communist in youre home listening recording everything.  Ask Alexa about election fraud, election cheating in the US and she will not give any pertinent info. In fact she'll often mislead you on right wing issues. Ask for Rush Limbaugh Live, Radio, .com and she eventually will play an OLD pod cast in the middle that will take a while of listening before you realize its OLD news. Ask her for any CNN, left wing media, ie Rachel Madow and you'll get a selection and she'll tell how long before Rachel is on TV and list of show dates and times. Ask Alexa bout Trump and often you will get out rite lies.The phone was complex to set up for my elderly mom.I moved Alexa to different locations in the house and it is always full of static electricity with small sparks when touched so I keep it away from other equipment.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2020"
115,meredith cruze,Some annoying shortcomings despite good sound and good screen,"  Clarification on some other reviewers’ comments: don’t confuse this with echo show 5–some reviewers suggest going to Home and Clock under settings to get a full clock showing and to remove Alexa skills rotation.  There is no such setting in echo 8.  Instead, it is wallpaper and clock.  And you don’t get to set a full clock face.  Just say Alexa show clock and she tells you, outright, “it is not supported on this device!”I am not sure if I would recommend echo show 8, given certain limitations I have seen, especially at the full price.  First, something that many other buyers have said:  lack of clock faces.  At night, I would hope for it to have a full clock face like echo show 5 does, but no.  All you see is a dim small digital clock.  Next, the annoying “echo does this echo does that” notices that rotate on the screen.  I have read suggestions in many forums on how to stop this, but no luck so far.  YouTube videos seem to be a natural for the 8 inch screen.  But there is no native YouTube app.  Rather, you are directed to a somewhat primitive-looking YouTube site on a browser, and from there you proceed to watch videos—which of course look quite good.  That said, the sound is pretty good, the screen in pretty good, and it does all Alexa skills pretty good.  Personally, I would get an echo show 5 and a traditional echo speaker in place of echo show 8.  A bit more expensive, combined, but best of both worlds.  By the way, I like the echo ecosystem a lot—I have one type or another in every room, and now in my car too.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2020"

I may try calling or chatting as this is a real let down and as I said, I will return or SMASH these as I am not happy at all.

121,Hz,Useless,"  I bought some Echo Shows because the Ring doorbell's video pops up when someone presses the doorbell. Unfortunately, it takes a *full 13 seconds* for the video to show up, as opposed to 2 seconds when I manually activate the ""Quick Ring"" app on my phone or tablet. That makes it useless upstairs, because by then, I'm typically on the way to the door.Then, not content to accept defeat, I decided to put the Show in the foyer next to the front door so you could avoid being bitten by a snake or mauled by a bear, the idea being that the video would have shown up by the time one of us got there. But it turns out that the automatically-triggered video is up for a grand total of *8 seconds*, which means that the only way you'll ever see it is by timing your actions like a NASA countdown and sliding down a fire pole.So basically, you're getting a pricey clock with wallpaper -- and the Echo Spot, which I love, is better for that, or the Mini with clock.It isn't just the doorbell that's the problem -- the other features that you might want to use, such as buttons for your smart home devices, are so big that you have to scroll through the screen to see anything. This makes sense for the little Spot, but with an 8"" display, there should be an option to view things in normally-sized type -- I mean, if you're close enough to swipe the screen, you're close enough to read a smaller font.So maybe someone can think of an application for this, but I can't. The Echo Spot makes a better clock, but it's no longer made. Perhaps the 5"" Show is a reasonable replacement. In the meantime, I can't think of an application for this. I'll continue trying to find one, and if I can't, send it back.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2020"

Would have liked to sync to my podcasts, Pinterest for recipes, be able to access/edit my calendar.-Screen times out quickly. I cannot find a way to change this in the settings. Especially annoying while using internet (using Pinterest for a recipe..difficult to get to Pinterest first of all, and then it timed out and I couldn't get the screen to return to what I was working on!)Basically, it needs more integration and functions.

124,Pony,"Don’t buy for a technologically challenged family member, unless you can be there to set it up","  Really quite disappointed with this.I bought two units for Mother’s Day. One for my wife and one for her Mom who lives 8hrs drive away.The idea was I would set it up so that my wife and Mother in law could see each other, rather than just talk on the phone.I should point out that my Mother in law is not technically ‘with it’ and can’t even do text.She has an iPad that she can’t use and struggles using her cell phone for more than just calling.Trying to set this up, I quickly realized she needed an Amazon account so that the new unit could be registered to it. So I created one for her, using her existing (little used) email address.So I thought armed with her Internet address and password, email address and password, new Amazon account and password, I would be able to make this thing work. Nope.It needs to connect to an Alexa App on her phone. Which isn’t there and she wouldn’t have a clue, how to load or use anyway. Don’t worry I thought, I can just call her from mine. No way. The outgoing call can’t be just linked to the Amazon email address that it’s linked to. It also needs a phone number.I loaded a phone number into the Amazon account and it needs a text verification. Giving the Mother in law a call, she found her cell phone and is now in the process of charging it. I still don’t know if it’s going to work this way around or not either, so can’t say I’m particularly thrilled.The wife is annoyed with me for wasting such a chunk of money on this, and I’m frustrated after spending 3hrs of my time trying to get the damned thing to work. Wish I had just bought a potted plant from my son to his Mom now. Cheaper, less frustrating and more likely not to have me in the dog house.I’m sure this is great system under normal circumstances, but if you are buying this to communicate with a distant relative who is not technically adept, right now I wouldn’t bother. Yes it has the great ‘check in’ feature,that is ideal for an instance like this, but really someone should have thought this particular use of this system through better.

126,MTK SURF,"Decent display, abysmal sound quality, VR tech still in its infancy","  I bought this at a local store because Amazon was temporarily out of them.Pros:  Easy to set up.  Plug it in and sign in to Amazon.  The display is clear.  The resolution is comparable to a cheap tablet.  You're not going to get 1080p at this price.Cons:  The sound quality is abysmal.  It was apparently designed to sound like a juke box with exaggerated mid  bass and and damped highs and mids.  Music sounds muffled.  The three band tone control can mitigate the frequency imbalance somewhat, but the best AQ is somewhat worse than a $20-$30 Bluetooth speaker.  A workaround is to plug a powered speaker of your choice into the aux output or use Bluetooth.  Yup, Bluetooth on another device is better.  The speech recognition is the signature feature.  The problem is that in order to use it you need to memorize a list of commands for each skill.  It's like learning a foreign language. If you spend enough time at it you'll be able to do a lot of things, but it requires quite a bit more effort than the average appliance.  If you enjoy the speech recognition on the phone when you're calling your cable provider you'll find Alexa delightful.  Sadly, the word ""operator"" does not result in human contact.  I bought this as a combination clock radio and bedside speaker.  The alarm feature works.  The mobile app allows you to set alarms if you forget the commands.  I discovered the Plex skill and found out that the set of voice commands doesn't allow you much precision in music selection.  I have a lot of music on my NAS.  I'm using the Plex web app in Firefox on the Echo Show.  The processing power of the device is limited and interaction with Plex, admittedly a bloated, slow moving piece of software, can be frustrating.  I'd love to have any of the several available DLNA clients that run on Android instead.  With a $30 speaker connected to the aux out I'm able to get the same thing as connecting my phone to the speaker and using a DLNA client app on the phone except that it is harder to use.Nope, I don't recommend the Echo Show.  The learning curve for Alexian, the language, is too long and playing music requires a separate device.  Spoiler:  Don't bother with the Spotify skill.

I own two Echos and three Echo dots and have been happy with them.  For Prime Day I purchased the Echo Show 8 and I want to smash it with the hammer Hillary used to destroy her emails.  It's truly a horrible device!  No YouTube, supposedly as of the day I received it.  Not only doesn't Blink work with Show 8 as it's supposed to, but the device also doesn't learn, it just keeps repeating the same annoying things like trying to sell me more Blinks and asking me if I want to connect to other Echo devices.  I was excited about the newest version being released but I think I've bought my last Echo.  Time to give Google a chance.  Amazon's excellent customer service helped me get Blink working on Show 8 but it stopped again and they have not been able to help me fix it.  YouTube still doesn't sync properly.  Flash briefings are a joke until you fix it on Alexa.amazon.com.  The microphones are terrible on Show 8, I have to yell for it to hear me.  With all the time Amazon had to work on this product, I expected it to be much more functional.  on 11/24/2020 I came back to see my review and update it if necessary.  The only update is it has gotten even worse.  I'm about to unplug it if they can't help me connect my Blink cameras and go back to one of my extra old faithful regular echo devices sitting around gathering dust since we downsized from a huge house to a regular-sized apartment.  I should mention that one of the most annoying aspects of the Show devices is the regular inappropriate suggestions to watch fake news stories from untrustworthy networks that make American's nauseous.  There should be more user control over the content, including shutting suggestions off entirely.  I DO NOT want to listen to NPR but there's no way to stop the daily push for me to which I imagine NPR pays for big time.  SO glad I didn't splurge for the larger size.  Almost just returned it but as I traded in my excellent Echo for it on Prime day, they will only give me $35.00 which is what it's worth at best but not enough to make the hassle of returning it worth my time.  I'll give them one plus, the fact that you can close the camera physically as I don't trust the electronic mute and close functions and I unplug all my Echo devices when making personal phone calls or just talking.

However the Shows have been so frustrating we're about to throw them all in the garbage.About half the time when we use drop-in either the calling device or called device does not have audio. Also there are other audio issues that seem to randomly come and go. It's like Alexa suddenly goes mute. She'll display something on the screen (like the alarm when a timer expires) but there is no accompanying audio. We've ""reset"" them hundreds of times, upgraded the software to latest version and talked to support multiple times.We have a strong home network with no other issues and, in fact, changed ISPs (with different internet providers and home network hardware/software during the time that we've had the Shows.

Telling Alexa to display live view from our camera triggers a connection from Echo to camera. This process has a undesirable delay that is not in the Ring app.2. Event notification about motion detection works. However, Echo does not atomically display live view, making this device useless for the reason I bought it for. I would have to tell Alexa to show the live view after the notification, further delaying display of the live event. Ring app does a much superior job (speedier) than Alexa.

Then if she doesn't know, she'll tell them who's Echo it is and ask you your name. Then when you tell her ,she'll ask if you want her to set up a voice profile you say yes. Then she will start calling you by your name. You can do that both on the Echo Show 8"" and the Echo Dot. Also with the Echo Show as long as you don't close your camera, you can call check in on kids pets etc and actually see them.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2020"
139,C,Echo Show a real help with elderly parent!,"  As an owner of a number of Amazon Echo devices (two Dots, one original tower, two 8"" Shows), I am a firm believer in the value of having Alexa in my home life.  Several years ago I got my dad involved with them too and he really loves his as well.  During the Covid-19 lockdown time of 2020, face to face communications between dad and myself and my siblings became more important than ever.  As dad hits his 86th birthday, dealing with technology has gotten increasingly more difficult for him.  I bought him a Show to put in his apartment in an assisted living facility.  I set it up for him ahead of time and he took off with it right away.  My sisters and I use our Shows to have video chats with our father several times a week and they are perfect for this task!  Video and sound quality are excellent, and most importantly our dad finds his new version of his constant companion Alexa easy to live with and operate.  A great device for this and many other uses.  Highly recommend.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2020"
140,Wolfie,Tired of the unnecessary Alexa prompts at bottom. Love Google Nest.,"  Alexa Show 8 bundled with a Show 5 was available at an incredible value at the Amazon 4 star store recently, but only when I got home I realized the discounted pricing was for the older 2019 versions. No worries though, as the main upgrade in 2021 is the camera and that's something I keep turned off as I don't make calls with it. The sound is decent and the screen is ok. It seems similar to the Show 5 devices.So now I have 1 Alexa Show 8 and 2 Alexa Show 5 devices in my home and it's driving me up the wall. What p-sses me off most is the unprompted suggestions Alexa makes both with voice and at the bottom of the screen. Worse still it stops playing my family photos and instead puts on a generic screensaver with a useless prompt every few minutes.I have turned off all follow up, and notifications, on these devices but instead of showing me photos that I would like to cycle constantly, Alexa keeps giving me random suggestions. By the way, did you know that you can set a routine etc......Alexa, I just asked you the time, I worked late night and I don't need your suggestions when I am still in bed trying to catch up on my sleep. Also it kept showing me, that I have 12 items on my shopping list constantly, and whether I'd like to purchase them. It shows one photo and then switches to that screen on all my 3 devices. It was a shopping list for Fresh, so I went and deleted it, but now Alexa keeps showing me that I have NO items on my list and would I like to add them? Also it shows random news bits and recipes I have no interest in, I'd rather just see my family photos.I mean, Google Nest only shows me stuff when I want. Other than that it keeps cycling through my family photos with just the time and the weather on the screen. If I sound annoyed so far, it's because I am. It's a device that the Amazon engineers have programmed to do what they would like you to see rather than care about what you'd like it to show. Typical!Also Google search is far more intelligent than Alexa and it goes to Youtube for videos so anytime I have a real question, I ask my 2 Google Nests or 3 Google Minis that I also have sitting next to all the Alexa Show and Echo devices. However, Alexa search has got a lot better than before, but it throws up more errors as well. I asked today, "" Alexa, what movie can I watch today"", knowing that Amazon owns IMDB. It asked me to tell the genre, I tried many simple genres like Comedy, Action and each time it said there is an error. So there is a long road ahead before Alexa can become truly intelligent and error free.Another example - I use my Alexa devices to read my Kindle books. It can read almost all Kindle book purchases, the Show device shows the current chapter being read but I wish it provided more details or something on the screen to make the speed faster or slower. When I said ""Speak faster"" Alexa changed her usual speaking speed, rather than changing the speed at which she was reading my book, so then I finally said ""Read faster"" and it was able to read my book a little faster. What's the use of Show if it does not use the screen during this time. Also I'd like the option of continuing to view my photos rather than see the chapter title.Hopefully, Amazon is listening to its heaviest Alexa device users and makes these updates. I would have shut these devices off, but then I also got a Ring camera and I would like to see who is at my door in different rooms....Amazon has us in their vice, and they know it.

I like my daughters Amazon Music but can't get it to play on the kitchen device.✔️Pictures works great!I figured out how to create the separate picture albums so I don't have to look at her friends and blurry pictures. 😂✔️Like the ""dinner-bell Announcement"" telling kids to come down. I am working on not yelling and this is helping! 😂❌Profiles are not user-friendly.-I am having a hard time w/ configuring our individual amazon accounts/profiles, and maintaining the settings on each device.-Knowing the ""keywords"" to say to get Alexa to function to her full potential.

142,Munky King,Good Device and Works With My XT2 Camera System,"  My specific purpose for buying this item was for working with my XT2 camera system.  I was concerned about a number of things: (a) The 'things to try' crap supposedly showing constantly on the screen, and supposedly not being able to get rid of it, and complaints that the Show 8 would not work with the Blink XT2 camera system.  Well, you CAN't totally get rid of the 'things to try' blip, but you CAN greatly reduce it, to a degree of almost background noise, by reducing the rotation rate.  It then almost becomes a non-factor, which makes me EXTREMELY happy.  As for the connection to the Blink XT2 camera, you need to do a little bit of work.  You need to have established a Blink account, as instructed by the Blink XT2 camera instructions.  After you have created your Blink account, you then need to enable the 'Blink Smarthome' skill, for your echo Show 8.  When you have gone though the process of setting your camera system up, the skill on your echo Show 8 allows you to work with your XT2 camera, with no issues, via voice command, as you would expect.Now for another comment, about the camera itself, which has really nothing to do with the Echo Show 8, but just as an FYI.  I noted a lot of folks unhappy with the XT2, because it did not notify you immediately, when it detected omtion.  This was due to the fact that it notified AFTER it finished making a recording, NOT upon start of the recording, with detected motion.  Well, at the end of 2019, that item was addressed by Blink, as stated in the following message:""We’re excited to announce our newest feature available for XT2 users, Early Notification, provided as a Beta preview release. This is currently only available in the US and Canada but we will be rolling this out to other regions soon. This article will be updated when that happens.When enabled, Early Notification configures the camera to send a message as soon as motion is detected, then the motion clip is recorded as usual and will appear in your list. When the Early Notification message appears in your app, you can tap it to join a live view of that camera and respond to events in real time.When disabled, notifications are sent when the motion clip finishes recording.To enable this feature, go to the camera settings screen and switch on the “Early Notification” toggle (shown in the image).""I have this new/beta item enabled on my new camera.**************************************************************************************************************************************UPDATEAfter successfully adding the first camera, of my three camera system, I proceeded today to set the two remaining cameras up.  I could not get the cameras to connect to the Blink app, and I spent a good 30 min. going nuts.  I then remembered something.  My Netgear Wireless Router and myself are very well acquainted with each other.  I routinely look at the logs, to see who is attempting to connect to my system, as I have the router email them to me.  I also used the feature 'Access Control' on the router to basically deny access to my system by any new system that wants to connect.  In this manner, I control who gets on my network.  Well, I had to turn this feature back to the 'allow all systems', to get the cameras permission to access my network.  Yep, I was happy, I had resolved the problem--NOPE!!  The cameras still would not connect!!  I think went into trouble-shooting mode, and plugged/unplugged the BLINK switch a couple of times--NO GO!!  I then noticed something in my router log, the following item was showing as being blocked:  F6B85E9992C5-MYSIMPLELINK  .  I looked that up on-line and found that it was tied into BLINK camera live initialization.  The 'F6B85E9992C5' contains the MAC address of the camera, which is stated on the camera, right under the serial number.  No, the MAC address that I am showing DOES NOT match my actual MAC address, I changed it, so as not to be stupid in a public showing.  I used the router software control to ALLOW access to the 'F6B85E9992C5-MYSIMPLELINK' item, which was the camera that I was trying to install.  The camera connected, both of them, and all was well.  Making this simplified, if you cannot get your camera to connect to the BLINK app, take a look at your router log ( if you have one ), and see if something is showing as being blocked, which matches the string that I previously mentioned.  It appears that the hexadecimal part of the front end of this string will change, to match the device, but the 'MYSIMPLELINK' stays the same, which you can always change the name, to match the location of the camera.  I left the hexadecimal front end alone, and just change the MYSIMPLELINK to match the location of my camera.  CHEERS!!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2020"
143,Jenny Ball,Not impressed,"  I'm not pleased with it.  This device is a missed opportunity.  There are a few nice features but what makes this piece of hardware so limited and frustratingly ironic is the software that drives it.  It's easier to list those things that you can't do than those things you can in this case.  This is because most of the things it can do are things that an Echo Dot can do.  Yes, I said it.  You would think that Amazon would take advantage of the display on the software side of things but nope.  Didn't happen.  The display is a light bleeder.  All around the edges of the screen there is light bleeding going on like someone tried to put a bandage on a wound and didn't cover sections of the wound.  The speakers are nice.  This I like, but it's only one part of an relatively expensive device that just so happens to have a display on it.  So while things sound great, if you are watching a video they look terrible and grainy to say the least.  You can't customize anything save the treble and bass of the audio and technically the wallpaper to some degree.  The wallpaper thing is annoying to me because it looks for an album or collage and wants to cycle through all the photos.  If you only have one photo you want to use it still switches to a standard Clipart photo on occasion as it is stuck searching for multiple images in that album or collage.  Why can't you just use a static photo?  There is no app list anywhere.  No app drawer or any reasonable way to access your installed apps without actually requesting it from Alexa.  Which you may say ""that's what devices like these are for!"" To which I say, when you're a foot away from the thing how hard is it not to mention how much faster would it be to swipe up or down and select the app you want from a list?  No, really...  The alarm settings on the thing is a waste.  I had two alarms set on the Show and they were fairly easy to set, but to turn them off?  You can't press a button.  You can't swipe the middle of the screen, no you have to pinpoint a tiny 1/2"" space in the lower right corner of the display and swipe up.  The problem is if you don't get it just right the device takes it as an attempt to snooze and the only way to turn it off is to grab your phone and open the Alexa app and turn it off there.  On top of that the device is finicky in that it will not always register your touch.  I have since removed those alarms on the show and just used the ones on my phone.  You can't customize the clock face.  You can't customize the image hue or contrast, only brightness.  The interface is very basic like it was meant for a child's play thing.  It feels very restrictive like simple rings you would think you should be able to do you can't because...you just can't.  One thing I do like is I can check my Ring cameras on the display.  That's nice, but not worth the price.  I can do the same thing with my phone and from anywhere.  The microphones are I intermittent at best.  Be prepared to raise your voice if you want to be heard and even then sometimes it still doesn't ""hear"" you.  Watching videos is okay in a pinch.  But that would have to be a very niche pinch because you would be better off proving your phone up and watching Netflix on it.  Video calls? One word, grainy.  It works!, but again, phone+Duo or Facetime= relative excellence.  Amazon needs to open this up where people can use it the way they want to use it and put a little more emphasis on what matters most for devices like this, the display.  To me this is just as bad as the Echo Auto just bigger and therefore a greater waste of space.  I'm not impressed.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2021"
144,Joel Fritz,Insanely Annoying,"  I bought this without a whole lot of expectations but even then, Amazon has managed to disappoint me. The Echo Show 8 has some nice features. I like that when I ask for information, it speaks and gives me something to read. It integrates with Prime Video very nicely. The Alexa portion performs pretty much like the Echo Dots - which is to say fairly well. That's about it for the good stuff.Now for the negative stuff... Configurability is limited. Setting a single image as wallpaper is impossible unless you want to upload a single photo to Amazon Photos... and that's just nuts. I should be able to set the wallpaper to whatever I want and even choose the colors I would like for the interface. But wait! There's more!! One of the most annoying aspects of the Echo Show is it's tenacity for showing suggestions. Everywhere you turn in this thing, Amazon is giving you suggestions. The right side fly-out, which handles the standard Alexa navigation, is given about a third of the screen. The rest is devoted to ""Discover Alexa"". It's irritating because with limited real estate, you'd think they would use the space for something more useful. Moving on to the Home screen, things get even more irritating. On the Show 8, the time is relegated to the left bottom corner of the screen, leaving the rest blank. Why isn't it full screen or at least configurable? No idea. The screen information rotates to show weather, recipes, news and more. They allow you to turn things off, which is nice but it's pretty much an all or nothing prospect if you don't want to see annoying suggestions. Every screen (except for the screen with the time and weather) contains a suggestion (for instance the weather forecast screen shows things like  ""Try ""Alexa, what's the weather?"""" which is super useful while you are looking at the weather.) and some of the suggestions feel downright invasive. Every so often I get a screen with two suggestions Alexa for Your Day ""cards"". The most recent had one ""Open Beat the Intro"" and the other was ""Tell me a story"" while others have been for music, recipes among other things. I don't need that or want it but there is no way to stop it short of taking a hammer to the thing. Worse still, a few days ago, I started getting full screen ads (f***ing ads!!!) for ""Men in Kilts"". Now, nothing against the show (I know nothing about it) but WTaF? Why is this ok? I don't need their ads in my home, turning my digital assistant into a small billboard sign!! At least not if they aren't going to pay me. I paid full price for the device and there was NO disclosure about having to look at flippin' ads.I am seriously reconsidering my relationship with Amazon. They have begun taking advantage of me as well as acting like I'm an idiot. Why they seem to think I need all these suggestions shoved in my face is beyond me. It feels like a single button option to view suggestions would cover that or even better, just let me decide if I want them and give me the ability to turn them off. Amazon could learn a few things about the layout on the Google Nest, which seems to utilize the screen space much better (admittedly I've only seen a few examples of it so it may be just as bad as the Echo Show).  This device could have been awesome. Instead, it's merely adequate and frankly, a bit ugly in my opinion.You have been warned.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2021"

146,Jack Straw,"False advertising - MUCH more complicated to set up, plus requires a smart phone AND Alexa to use","  My family purchased the Echo Show 8 for my 95 year old grandmother to make video calls and stay connected to us during COVID-19. According to the ad page on Amazon, it's ""Simple to set up and use! 1. Plug in 2. Connect to the internet using Echo Show 3. Just ask Alexa for music, weather, news and more"". What the description does NOT tell you is that a smart phone with Wifi/the Alexa app is required for setup as well. I have been relatively tech savvy with virtually every other device I've ever purchased - this is, by far, the least intuitive/user friendly. I set up an Amazon account using my grandmother's name and email, got her to verify the one-time password and confirm the account, then logged into Alexa using that account. I added myself, parents, and siblings to the contacts in the Alexa app, which for some stupid reason won't sync with the Echo Show despite being connected to her Alexa account. There appears to be no option to add contacts directly through the Echo Show itself without connecting/verifying a mobile phone number (which, again, why TF would you need an Echo Show if you already have a smart phone that supports video chatting).If you're buying this for a family member and they already own a smart phone, you might as well just go with the video chatting via Facebook messenger - at least that is free and easy to use.

147,Kimberly L. Gould,Beware offer to Trade-In (updated 1/9/20),"  Love this Echo Show.  It has a  much larger screen and I can easily read it from across the room.  The only issue I have is that I am disappointed with the Upgrade and Trade-in discount which offered me $30 instant credit if I sent in my old unit.  My old unit sat untouched on a table for a year.  It was like new out of the box when I sent it in.  I wrapped it in bubble wrap and newspaper and dropped it off at UPS.  Now they rejected the suggested $30 discount and have charged my credit card.  The reason?  Scratches.  Absolutely no way there was a single scratch on that unit.  I'll be interested in seeing the condition it's in when it is returned.  I won't every use that Ugrade and Trade-in offer again.Update:  After a couple of weeks I just received my old unit back.  I was anxious to see the ""scratches"" that they claimed were the reason they didn't accept it.  Of course, there weren't ANY, not a single scratch.  But the best part, wait for it... is that they returned it without the cord.  So now, if I want to sell it I have to buy a $15 cord for it.  This trade-in program is a scam and I am really surprised Amazon is okay with it.  Basically, they lure you in with a higher amount and ask you to ok ahead if they feel it is worth less (which it always is, I'm sure).  If like me you don't agree to take a lower value then they just ship it back to you.  Beware!",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2019"
148,Joe,This Simplifies My Life,"  I received my Echo Show 8 today and it's already set up and I'm very happy with it. I bought a second one, as well, to give to my mother for Christmas. I intend to buy security cameras very soon to work with Alexa, and I just purchased smart bulbs to use in my home. I also have a 43"" TCL Roku Smart TV, which I can control, to some degree, with Alexa. I'm still figuring it out, but I've been able to switch from antenna TV, and open my Hulu app on the TV through Alexa. I haven't tried asking for a specific show or channel to play, but Alexa should be able to do those commands. The Echo is in my kitchen and the TV is in my bedroom, and they communicate just fine.I was in the cleaning mood tonight, and have been listening to some great Motown through the Echo Show 8 from my Amazon Music account. I'm impressed with the speakers and clarity. They're not top of the line, but they sound great, not at all tinny.I also noticed that when I turned the lights down, the Echo automatically went into a standby mode, blank with just the time showing. The music continued to play, however. When I turned the lights back on, it woke up again, displaying song lyrics, etc. Oh, and even with the music up at its loudest, I am able to give Alexa a command without having to yell, even from across the room.The Echo does continually show suggestions at the bottom of the screen, which some people have complained about. I pretty much ignore it because I'm not usually staring at the screen for it to bother me. While it's just sitting there, it will also go through news headlines. There may be a way to change these features, but I haven't yet explored that possibility.I did, also, ask Alexa to open Hulu and started watching a show directly on the Echo, just to test it out. It worked well, and the picture looked good. I just had to sign into Hulu on the Amazon Alexa app.There's still much to learn, but overall, I can see the Echo Show 8 being a helpful and fun part of my everyday routine. I asked Alexa to set a reminder alarm, which she did, and that's going to be a huge help for me. Once I get security cameras and the lights put up, I'll be set. I resisted getting any kind of ""Smart"" device for a while, but I'm glad I finally got the Echo. I'm always looking things up on my phone, or setting alarms to remind me to do things, so this just makes staying informed and organized so much easier. I will probably get another Echo Show 8 for my room after I get the security cameras so I can check them without having to go into the kitchen.I scooped up my Echo Show 8 and my mother's during the Black Friday sale on Amazon, so I couldn't resist the price. I also got Echo Dots for my four grown daughters, and will see how they like them.UPDATE: I thought this was great. I asked Alexa for the number to Fed Ex, which she found. Then she asked if I'd like her to call them for me. I talked to Fed Ex through Alexa and the call was clear. After the call, I said, ""Alexa, hang up."" And that was it! I didn't have to pick up my phone or search for the number. I love my Echo!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2019"

The end result of this device is a screen that is little more than a mounted Amazon advertisement.You can’t browse YouTube. You can’t browse Netflix. You can’t use a myriad of apps that work perfectly well on android devices (and other amazon devices like the new kindle) because of Amazon’s insistence on using their own, purposefully limited, OS.There’s little-to-no developer support outside of novelty “skills” that don’t deliver a satisfactory user experience... Not that it would actually matter if there was developer support since the UI is so heavily voice-dependent that the device essentially doesn’t function without knowing the appropriate voice command and makes searching for skills and apps all but impossible.Overall, pretty disappointed",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2020"

I could choose a different background but I couldn't  mix and match and change the clock style or face. As I got ready to reset it and start the return process, I noticed that the software was and older version and could be updated. If I hadn't gone to that area, I wouldn't have known that. No prompts on it at all. I got excited when I noticed the the newer software version was the same as the Show 5 so I stopped, updated and waited.

The try it stuff on the bottom isn’t that bothersome to me. It’s the fact that I tell it to turn on a light, and the blue band stays across the bottom of the screen like it’s waiting for me to say something else, then the band disappears, I get no response, like “ok”, and I get no lights on.I been using the dots for awhile, everything is set up, and works on the other dots. It’s like this device suffers from a case of the “stupids”. I think the screen is a niche thing that nobody really needs in an age of cell phones, and it makes the device worse by having it. I’m thinking the Show uses different firmware than the dot, and the show firmware is poorly done, which is actually a conservative review.Purchase at your own risk. Odds are you don’t need it if you have a smart phone with the Alexa app on it. If you insist, I’d wait it out a bit til the developers get their crap together on the software side of this. If you just want to control a plug or light, pick up a 2nd gen dot on the cheap.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2019"
155,Sue L.,Would be more stars if more flexible and better executed,"  The first one I bought was a convenience with which to communicate with my 86 YO mother who still lives on her own. Subsequent purchases were made due to a gift made all the more special by the inability to get basic medical care when the diagnosis was made during this COVID hysteria: they make me omnipresent with my wife as she is waylaid by chemotherapy. Outside  of that, I wouldn't have them. Here's why:I like to cook. The recipes the Echo in the kitchen shows are rarely more than inane, and usually stupidly named on the feed, turning out to be something other, either subtly or drastically, than the feed title implied.I'm a news junky. The ""news"" it will give you is always biased, anti-Trump  pap, and you're stuck with what Bezos has chosen for you to select from. No balance, no escape other than disabling it.There is really little about these that I like about these, considering their potential. You cannot customize the name it will respond to beyond those Bezos' programmers have chosen, so it's not even fun. The touch screen is barely responsive. The smarthome integration, at least with Insteon, ISY994i, and Honeywell thermostats is basic, quirky and inflexible. Ring integration is pointless. It feels to me as if they had Apple develop the hardware - it has the same ""live in our cage"" concept with little ability to ""make it yours"".But the video chatting with ma is great, and the intra-home intercom capability, though invoking it is unnatural, is useful. And the sound quality is on par with most wireless speakers. Coupled with its connectivity, this alone makes it worth the purchase price.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2020"
156,Tanya C.,A five-star review .. except for the ads. Can't give it more than one.,"  UPDATE: Instead of addressing the things to try annoyance, Amazon is also now going full screen with it, replacing your choice of home screen content. It puts up a full screen ""Alexa for your day"" that lists multiple annoying ""things to try"". There is no way to turn it off permanently. I would not buy any Echo Show device until they stop blasting it with ads like this.I had a Show about a year ago and returned it because the ""Things to try"" ads were annoying and could not be turned off. I was hopeful Amazon had listened to their customers and provided an option by now. To the ones that say there are no ads, I'm not sure what else to call something that is encouraging me to buy something on Prime Video, for example. Not all are incoming producing for Amazon, but they are still ads.To those saying turn of Discovery in Home Content .. this has NOTHING TO DO WITH THINGS TO TRY! It is turned off and I still get the ads. Besides, it's not on the home screen where it is most annoying. It is, for example, when listening to music and in other skills where it appears and is totally unrelated to what Alexa is doing at the time.Perhaps as a cruel tease, there is a ""Things to Try"" in Settings. But it doesn't allow you to set anything .. it just shows you more of the things to try.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2020"

158,Zen,Way Better Than Expected,"  I was very skeptical about this here version of the Echo Show for a long time. I at last decided to gone ahead and buy it, still not truly knowing what I was getting into, even after a few videos by others whom have purchased it. The bass is awesome with no need for a Bluetooth speaker, I'm cool with the display as well as I have seen worst quality out there. This make my first Echo Show device and second Echo device in all this far. With that said, I am still very tempting to get the 10 inch Echo Show 2nd generation, especially after hearing the sound quality of the Show 8 HD in which looks very beautiful sitting atop my Trophy Showcase. One thing I love the most about Echo devices is the comfort of knowing they are always improving thanks going out to Amazon for that. The try Alexa down at the bottom of the screen isn't a bother to me. I take privacy extremely serious and the added shutter for the cam is a BIG plus. Setup for me only took about 6 minutes or less being as though I was only upgrading from my Echo Dot 2nd Gen. In which I still love of course. Eventually I will also be the proud owner of that Echo Show 10 2nd Gen. Until then, this will hold me. Update, this device is still going strong. I also love the fact that it hears me better than my Echo Dot. A few upgrades I would have like to have seen being as though this Echo Show is newer than the Show 2nd Gen, it should have came with a bigger screen but is still cool. I would have also like to have seen a screen protector that you can leave on because the screen does accepts fingerprints very well when touched. I love the fact that it also comes complete with a actual phone with dialing pad. It’s like having a network phone. Maybe one day 𝗔𝗺𝗮𝘇𝗼𝗻 will offer free phone numbers like Google to work exclusively with Echo devices that will allow for not only making calls but receiving them to. This would make the Echo devices absolutely perfect. Another thing that I like about the Echo that I forgot to mention , especially this model, not only do you have prime music as a choice when using this device for listening to music, you can also connect your phone, laptop, iPad, etc to it using your devices Bluetooth and play your own music right through the Echo and Echo Show devices for a better listening experience. What’s even more, you have the controls right there on the Echo Show devices to play, stop and go to next song and back a song as well as song title and artist information right on the screen making it an even better choice to own a Echo Show device. As for me, goodbye stereo, hello Echo Show, money very well spent.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2020"
159,Bi12dy,The Echo is an incredibly useful piece of tech.,"  I used to use another voice assistant that... uhmmm...came with my android tech. I was apprehensive about making the switch to Alexa. But after having my Echo 8 for a few months I am totally head over heels in love with Alexa. I watch tv, listen to the radio, ask it questions, make lists and memos, look up recipes, set timers, use it as a super loud alarm clock, check the security cameras around my home...and a whole plethora of other things with it. My favorite thing has to be the ability to call my Echo from anywhere I am. I use that feature to check on my dogs while I'm not home. It drives them nuts to hear me and not be able to find me...heh heh. I honestly didn't think I would have so many uses for a smart speaker. The hd display and sound are excellent. It fills my home with music. I could list several more of the uses I've discovered but you guys get the idea. The Echo is worth every penny.

160,Bi12dy,My Disappointment Grows Day by Day,"  While there are some useful tools with the Echo Show 8, after one full year's use I've decided that the frustration with the photo display option overcomes any positive experiences I've had with the Echo Show 8. I've been in touch with tech service, used the forums, and written directly to customer service, all to no avail. Amazon knows there is a problem with photo display and continues to promise to correct it, but never does.1. The Alexa app is supposed to give the option to add whatever photos you want from your Amazon library for continuous rotation on the Echo Show 8 by creating albums and selecting them for display. THIS FEATURE HASN'T WORKED SINCE THE FIRST DAY I RECEIVED THE MACHINE. No matter what options I choose on the Alex App for photos, all I get is a display of random photos from my library.2. I have spent countless hours dealing with tech support and customer service, and no solution has been offered that works. Occasionally I get an email from Amazon saying it's a system wide problem and they are working on it, but after 12 months, they can't resolve it.3. I've tried a factory reset, re-registering the machine, and every other solution offered by Amazon, and none of them work. Random photos from my library keep appearing. I even tried deselecting all the options for photos, and they still continue to appear.4. It seems that I am not alone with this problem. The forums are full of frustrated people experiencing the exact same photo display issues and disappointment with the Echo 8 that I am, and Amazon is either unable to correct the situation or just doesn't care.If this is a manufacturing defect from a specific lot of machines, why doesn't Amazon offer a replacement?

161,umeweall,Great for the kitchen and general use,"  There’s a lot of devices out there. Almost too many at times. But the good news is that usually means a lot of variety. The trick is selecting what works and applies to your needs without getting sucked into marketing and pointless features. With all that said, I’d say the echo 8 comes right where we wanted to land as a family.We originally purchased an echo 5 on Black Friday. While it’s great for the price, it’s small and the speakers are lacking when it comes to playing audio with any volume. The 8 definitely delivers over the 5 in terms of audio quality. Much clearer and robust.Larger screen is a big plus with better quality picture. This isn’t a device I’d expect or demand 4K in. 1080 is fine. Nothing is generally grainy or hard to see. It’s the right size for a kitchen without being excessive and space demanding.Performance wise it’s fast. Does a great job with home automation and commands. I like the shutter for the camera and button to cut the mic off.The only ding I’d give it is it should have the option of being a true smart hub. I would love to attach my z wave devices to it and remove the entirety of a secondary controller. I know the larger show does have some of these functions but at a much larger size it wasn’t what we wanted. Add in the extra cost, the show 8 was a winner for us.I’d recommend it to anyone who wants a good kitchen companion. The off white color is a nice compliment to kitchens.

I primarily bought this device to use with my Arlo cameras. Unfortunately, the Arlo skill is terrible. Most of the time, the cameras simply time out and will not display on the screen.

163,Bruce,Something For Everyone.  Great Purchase!,"  For those that don’t like “Try Alexa” on the bottom,  you can go to the Alexa app,  choose your “Show” in the device setting,  scroll down and turn on do not disturb.  Also, you can simply ask Alexa to turn on do not disturb. It changes the screen to a largerclock and removes the “Try Alexa”. I can still see my photos changing like a digital picture frame. I would imagine the next software update may give more options to toggle it off,  have more clock options, etc.As for the normal experience of having the Echo Show 8,  what a fun and useful tool that will take a long time to explore all of its uses. Sound and picture are very good.  I have some Foscam cameras,  Arlo and Nest cameras that are enabled and working.  This is not a security monitor, but gives you a convenient way to see what is going on.  I have an LG TV I can turn on and off, change volume and channels, some smart plugs to turn lights off an on.  Look,  for the $79 I paid for this it does more than anything else I own!

The playlist I was listening to would just stop mid-song and techno music would start. Always the same two unknown techno bands. Sometimes it would start playing when I wasn’t even listening to music. I’d stop it and it would start back up again. I had no control over Alexa.  The issue increased from a couple of times a day to several times a day. Finally called in to Amazon tech support (in the Philippines) and after asking me a bunch of questions, they had me reset it.

166,IrishLassie54,Great upgrade from older Echo Show,"  We bought this to upgrade from our older Echo Show we have on the kitchen counter. We absolutely love it. We don't really listen to music on it since our kitchen is open to the living room, but the sound quality is good. The display looks great as well. I do wish there would be more options to customize the screen interface. It could also be a little smoother using the interface to control other smart devices. However, we don't really use the screen for that so I didn't knock any stars. I'm glad there is a shutter on the camera that we always keep closed since we never use it for calling.We mainly use the screen for viewing our Arlo and Ring cameras. The Ring doorbell camera was really easy to set up a routine where it automatically shows the camera on the screen when the doorbell is pressed. After a recent update I was also able to get it to show the Arlo camera when motion was detected using the custom actions.Its an all around great set up. I just wish they'd improve the interface on the screen. I may actually use it a lot more if it were better.

168,Priscilla Davidson,Alexa is very Addictive,"  The Alexa is very addictive.  We started out by getting the 8"" Show for the kitchen, thinking that would be all we needed.  Then we realized that we needed Smart Plugs to actually control something.  Well you have to be close to a Hub for Alexa to hear you properly.  So then we bought a Dot, followed closely by an Echo.  The sound on the Echo was pretty good, so wouldn't it be perfect in the bedroom.  Let's get one Studio for the Living Room.  Now started a whole series of smart switches for the different areas of the house.  The first Studio sounds so good, lets get a second to make it a sound system in the Living Room.  I'm probably not done since there is still the T-Stat, Garage Door, and a dozen more switches to go.  I've spent my monthly allocation and have to wait a while to get more.  At least I'll have things to put on my Christmas and Birthday List.After the usual start-up pains, the occasional tight gang boxes, and figuring how to integrate the Home Theater into my existing TV, it has been pretty smooth and painless.  Each different Manufacturer seem to have their own integration APP to communicate with Alexa.  But they all operate pretty smoothly together.The Drop-in feature is a little strange.  We surprised our daughter by suddenly talking into her Apartment through her Show.  The grandkids all had a riot talking with us, even though they Facetime quite frequently.  The sound and video quality of the Drop-in and Announcement  features on the Show are pretty poor compared to  Facetime.

169,mktgmom,PU,"  If you want to use the Echo Show 8 as a speaker for your TV or computer, you have to connect by Bluetooth. There's no line in. If you connect a computer by Bluetooth, then EVERY SINGLE TIME YOUR COMPUTER RECONNECTS AFTER A FEW MINUTES OF SILENCE, Alexa will shout NOW PLAYING FROM ACER ASPIRE L83i-9-3H61 or whatever. It takes so long for her to say the name of the computer that you can't even hear the notification sound or the first several seconds of whatever is playing on the PC. If you say ""Alexa, mute,"" the volume will only go down UNTIL THE NEXT TIME IT HAPPENS. It happens at all hours if my computer makes any sound (I have my PC set up to let me receive texts, and occasionally other apps make a noise for some reason). It startles the *#$) out of me every time it happens. Bonus: Alexa can't say ""Acer"" properly so she yells NOW PLAYING AUDIO FROM ASSER 39J-89H7T regularly, including when I'm on Zoom with the mic on, and my coworkers react to it like I'm watching something inappropriate. Fortunately it hasn't happened in front of kids or parents.I specifically wanted to use the Echo Show for my computer's sound because my monitor has a terrible-sounding, quiet speaker in it and there's no remote. My desk is tiny so everything has to have multiple functions. I need to be able to see the Ring doorbell camera from the Echo Show so I don't want to just use a different speaker instead. I watch or listen to media from a distance pretty often, and again there's no remote on my monitor, so it's nice to be able to control the volume by voice, especially if it's late and something loud comes on. But the Alexa ""now playing"" voice is SO LOUD and so jarring that the experience is unpleasant and it's loud enough to wake up other people who live here anyway. Hundreds of people have complained about it on Amazon's forums (and feedback form) but it's still happening. What was Amazon thinking?Also, one of the only reasons I got more than one Echo in the first place was that I have ADHD and the timers and reminders are really helpful for me. I just say ""set a timer for x minutes"" and it helps me remember things and be on time to work. But there are SERIOUS issues with how timers, alarms and reminders work, especially if you have multiple users in the house. You can't set an alarm or timer to go off on all or multiple devices (?!!??!?!??!?!?!?!??!). How on earth am I supposed to know where I'm going to be when the alarm goes off? If you set a timer in the kitchen and then get distracted on the way back from the bathroom, say, you obviously can't hear the timer go off. It's like they've never even used any of the stuff they make. You can't name alarms. The repeat options aren't flexible. The snooze and dismiss options aren't flexible and you can turn them off in your sleep anyway. All you have to say is ""Alexa cancel."" You can cancel other people's alarms too. You can set *reminders* for all devices, and you can name them, and you can repeat them (even multiple times a day which is great), but you can only pick either ONE device or ALL devices, including your phone. 🙄 You can't pick all the devices except your roommate's bedroom, for instance. You can't pick all except your phone. It's ridiculous.If you don't have any Alexa devices yet, you can look at most of the options in the app because the app makes your phone or tablet function somewhat like an Echo device.All of these complaints are after the disappointment of realizing it doesn't do most of the stuff I wanted it to do.

Having just installed a new home office desk I placed this Amazon unit side by side against the first generation competitor product.  In every case the competitor product was faster, slicker and better.Then I wanted to watch my young child on the baby monitor, the competitor product looked better, and worked fine.  The Show forced me to reboot the camera and even then spent 95% of the time buffering.  I have no idea why.  I have a modern high speed mesh network and no issues with any other devices.The competitor product has an absolutely delightful screen saver when not in use.  The Show has an inferior screen saver and spends 95% of the time basically showing ads for itself.  ""Why don't you try asking Alexa this?""  No thanks.  I'll accept a nice screen saver, but constantly telling me to play games with it, or try this command or that, is just annoying.  As is the fact that the clock and weather forecast keep changing position and size.I think the only reason to be wowed by this product is if you've never seen a competitor product.As a fan of Echo products generally, I can't believe what a miss this product was.

I need a LARGE clock face - I bought the 8"" Echo instead of the 5"" because I thought the larger screen would let me have a LARGE clock face.

The screen on this one is beautiful, the sound is fine, the voice recognition works. Setup was a bit wonky - seemed it didn't recognize my wifi or Amazon passwords if I had ""Show"" on to see what I'd typed. Annoying, but whatever, you do it once.

It does so many things alarm, timer, reminders, shopping list, jokes, music, etc., etc., etc... I find out something new that it does everyday.  Don't know how I lived without it.

176,Keith,Not impressed at all with this one.,"  After using the 2 Echo Dots I just received I was really hoping for an enhanced experience with the Show 8. Set up was fine. But, from the jump the Show just had trouble hearing. I have tried all of the wake words and the only one that even comes close to working is ""computer"". I used different words for each device, the same for all and various combos of two of one and one for the other. I even tried it with the Dots unplugged. The Echo Dots hear me from anywhere in my place and do not fight over which one is going to carry out the request. The Show misses its wake word at least 35 percent of the time no matter the distance and then its a fight to get it to understand what I want. Also, when I aske the Echos for the weather they sometimes make sure to tell me the city. However even though they are all set to my exact location in all three areas of the software and device settings, they give me the weather for the main city in the area not for my city which is still in the top seven for Ohio. The temp and conditions many times vary a lot between the two cities even with an only 11 mile difference. Main city is right up against Lake Erie at a lower elevation.  Accuweather, Weather Bug, Weather.com and everyone else know the difference between the two. However the Alexa software which I am told uses Accuweather can't seem to shake the problem. Customer service was no help, just told me to try a skill. I can get the correct weather. I just need the weather that is displayed on the home screen of the Show to be correct and not embarrassingly wrong. If I didn't get it for only 70 dollars with a 24 dollar smart plug it would be going back today. But no Echo Dots are available for at least a month.

177,Mr. Eddie S.,Works decently,"  I've been using the Echo devices since their inception, even have one in my car that I don't use since the integration with autos is just horrible.But at home, I've had luck, original tower model, 2nd gen, and all the shows, first and second gens.  Even a dot or two in the mix.But the shows seem to have worse recognition for voice than the other ones do.  I have no idea why, but the 10"" in the great room more often than not mishears what I say, and the 8"" in my bedroom isn't much better.  I'm not talking with any weird accent, I'm not mumbling, I'm not rushing words out.  I'm doing the exact same things that worked nearly flawlessly with the old style echo towers, and it just doesn't recognize as well with these Show devices.Screens are nice, I like having the ability to see things, since we use them as clocks and weather stations, and they fill that function nicely.Sound is good.  Not audiophile level, obviously, but decent bass from a little box like this for music and the voice doesn't sound tinny when she talks.  Integration with smart devices is all there just like the rest of them, but again, ""turn on <whatever>"" half the time has her trying to turn something OFF.I like the screens but wish the voice recognition wasn't so sub-par comparatively.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2020"
178,Abraxas,Bugs or Lemon? You decide.,"  Gosh. Hard to figure out where to start. We’ve had Echo since it’s infancy with just minor hiccups. Kept the original and got the Show 5. We wanted a larger screen, so we gave the 5 to our son and got the 8. Total dissatisfaction! This thing stops at random, quits showing pictures whenever it feels like it, has a real hard time even understanding the English language,( yes, that setting is right), most of the time it will not pair with our other Echo, increases, decreases volume whenever it likes! The list goes on and on. So, I contact customer support and let the representative listen to her ignore my commands.I say commands because I paid Bezos good money for this chock block. They had me do a factory reset on it, which I already tried, and it was like chocking the other wheel. Amazon has a really hard time admitting that maybe, just maybe, I have a lemon or they launched these things before they were perfected. Either way,Jeff, you have a totally dissatisfied long time Prime customer here that doesn’t believe for a second that this review will mean squat!

179,Abraxas,Annoyingly quirky,"  This HD 8 is our 2nd recently-purchased Echo Show, the other being a previously purchased Echo Show HD 5.  It replaced a standard Echo.  The sound and video are very good.  Setup was reasonably easy and Alexa integration is very good. However...It’s annoyingly quirky, starting with the settings, which are, oddly and confusingly, different than those on the HD 5.  The most annoying setting difference is the home screen “Wallpaper & Clock” selection; while you can choose different background “categories”, you can’t prevent them from rotating the multiple images (some being strange) within the chosen category, which becomes distracting eventually.  I had to change my background to “Minimal”, which is just a blank screen with a small time, weather icon, and outdoor temperature display in the upper left corner, also different than the HD 5.Another quirky/annoying thing that happens with our HD 8 is that streaming audio, from varying internet sources will just stop on its own, sometimes restarting on the HD 5 or just starting from the beginning on the HD 5, which is in the same room, but with a different wakeword.  This never happened with my Echo.The HD 8 does not recognize spoken requests/commands as well as the HD 5 or my Echo  I will try voice training to see if I can resolve this issue.Very disappointing.*** Update: Even using the ""Minimal"" background, or a single image uploaded via Alexa, the screen will blink at the same rate that other backgrounds rotate images, making me think that the HD 8 is rotating even these simple backgrounds, which can become very annoying, especially if the HD 8 is nearby, which in my case is a side table next to a chair I spend time in.  This additional discovery has caused me to reduce my rating from 2 stars to 1 and relocate the device to another room and bring back my Echo.  Had I know all this in advance, I never would have bought the thing, but now I'm stuck with it.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2020"
180,david,"AMAZON: PLEASE TURN OFF THE ""TRY ALEXA"" TEXT","  I bought the Echo Show 8 as a Christmas gift for my wife, who wanted to use it in the kitchen. She was a bit heartbroken over the the ""things to try"" scrolling non-stop across the screen, we were going to return the unit. However, Amazon must have gotten many complaints because they reduced  the ""things to try"" down quite a bit - But is still a device that I own and I should have control over the content.Mounting:Our kitchen is tiny, so the only option was to mount it below a cabinet. Note that there is no provision to mount it this way. I had to make a mount that curled down and around the back to the bottom. There is a metal plate on the bottom of the Echo Show 8 and it can be secured with a large magnet.. which is what I did. Because we are tight on counter space, I made the mount on a rail that allows the whole unit to be slid back under the cabinet to get it out of the way (you can see this in the pictures I included.)  If we had a bit more room we would have just set it on the counter or picked up one of the many mounts available.The good:The screen is bright, clear and adapts nicely to changes in ambient light. The clock is useful. You can load your own pics so it rotates through them, making a nice picture frame (my wife loves this.) When you ask for the weather it gives a nice display of the hourly temps/forecast, or a weeks overview, depending on what you ask for (see pic.) The speaker is adequate. Alexa does all the things available on Dot or other device: runs routines, turns lights on and off, has the Guard feature, etc.  The Echo Show 8 is useful for viewing security cameras, we have some Wyze cameras and we can just ask ""Alexa, show me the entrance"" and in a few seconds, its on the screen (see pic.) When you play music, the Echo 8 displays the lyrics. If you set a countdown timer while cooking, it remains on the screen. If you set two timers, it shows the one that is going to go off first, then shows the second: my wife loves this for cooking (she used to have to keep asking Alexa ""how much time is left on the timer?"" as she tried to coordinate multiple items being readied. You can watch movies on the Echo Show 8 as well, probably not the best screen for viewing, but it does work.To be frank, the Echo 8 earns its keep just on the above features.The ""could be better"":When looking up recipes, the Echo 8 displays them one at a time. It is exactly like an Echo Dot, except there is a picture - the screen could be utilized to show multiple possibilities and cut the browsing time down tenfold. There is no provision to enter and save your own recipes, my wife still gets out her Ipad and uses that.  Amazon says there are thousands of skills, but the majority of them are at best, kinda lame (having the Gordon Ramsey skill make rude comments about food was funny for about 15 seconds.) Like the recipe function, very few of the skills are optimized to work with a screen in a helpful way... this is an area that really disappointed us. I was expecting something that could work more like a tablet in capabilities.We have multiple Alexa Dots throughout the house, and their capabilities have grown tremendously over the past two years. Many of the capabilities were unexpected and very useful, such as Guard and geofencing, both of which we now use daily.  I suspect, and hope, that the Echo Show 8 evolves in the same way. And I hope Amazon gets rid of the ""things to try,"" which keeps this review at 1 star",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2019"
181,Hollywood Steve,Read my review for ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW,"  I was very hesitant with purchasing this Echo Show 8 because I had never had an Alexa product and didn't want to risk spending money for something I didn't love. I essentially wanted an iPad for my kitchen to look up recipes and play music but didn't want to spend a fortune:PROS:- Great sound quality- Able to customize wallpaper/screensaver to your photos (but you have to download amazon photos app and individually select the photos you want, which was a pain)- Connects with your internet and log-ins for music super easily! I didn't have to sign-into ANYTHING at all except my amazon account! Once you plug it in, it connects to your wifi, all your amazon/pandora music, etc.CONS:- It is VERY limited to a few sites for recipes look-ups (Allrecipes.com)- It's basically ONLY voice-command (which I had to get used to. There is no physical home button and you can't do much with the screen itself....only voice.)- You have the option to watch Hulu or Foodnetwork on there if you have a subscription but nothing else.Overall, if they made the Echo Shows more varietal I would buy the upgraded version. This Echo Show 8 works great so far but I would like it to do more and be more functional on the screen rather than just be limited to voice-commands.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 23, 2020"
182,Joe L.,Perfect way to video with Grandma during Covid,"  I purchased this after my grandmother broke her hip  and was placed in a short term rehab nursing home. Due to Covid they are not allowing any visitors aside from bringing Grandma to a window where we can talk through. I setup the show to where it basically only makes/accepts calls because Grandma is not tech saavy. So far it has worked great. She loves being able to see us and we love being able to see her. I also love the Drop In feature so I can check on her throughout the day without her having to answer the call. I definitely recommend if you are trying to stay in touch with loved ones.The one downfall that I ran into was that I needed to set her up with an amazon account, phone number, etc. So i just used my own account. So when I call I am calling myself or if anyone else in the family calls it rings all of my Alexa devices. Aside from that it is working out great!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2020"
183,johnthomasc3,"Great Sound, Works well with Alexa","  I've had Google Home and Amazon Echo (Dot) for the last two years. The Echo Show (8"") was the latest addition this year. I decided to go with the Echo Show because of it's integration with our Ring Doorbell. The sound is as good, if not slightly better, than the Google Home (1st Gen) that we have. I like the 8"" screen display. It makes it easy to read text such as recipes, etc. It also has a nice clear picture when viewing through the Ring doorbell. Alexa, however, seems to be much more finicky when it comes to giving instructions. For example, when I ask Alexa to ""Answer the door"" when the doorbell rings, Alexa asks me who I'd like to call and gets stuck in that mode (the correct command is ""Alexa, answer the front door""  or ""talk to the front door."" Also, it is a tad bit slow in doing so when I do give the right command. Easier and faster just to pull out the phone out of my pocket and push on the Ring icon. In the same manner, Alexa seems slightly less intelligent than Google in asking other open ended questions, which is why I am glad to have both available when I need them. I have the Echo Show and three Dots in or home along with 4 (generic) smart plugs for being able to program and turn lights on orally, very handy. Alexa integrated very easily with them. I have a couple of glitches that I can't explain though. Twice Alexa stopped recognizing all of them for a brief period (an hour or so), then the next thing you know they all worked again. It wasn't a network problem (they were still all connected) but perhaps Alexa was doing an upgrade or something, who knows. All in all, I am happy with my new addition.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2020"
184,Mrs. C,"If you’re caring for someone with dementia/Alzheimer’s, this is life-changing","  It’s been months since I’ve been able to visit in-person with my wife, who has Alzheimer’s. Her memory care facility has been completely closed to visitors. Having an Echo Show in her room has let me be more in touch with her in some ways than even our former weekly in-person visits. The beauty of the Echo Show is the Drop In feature. With one click I can connect from my phone to the Show on her nightstand. It comes on without her - or facility staff - having to do a thing. This is a game-changer! Because during the pandemic staff have been so overworked and stressed, being able to connect with your loved one without asking for staff assistance makes life better for everyone.I’m not going to spend much time on the technical aspects - the camera doesn’t give as sharp an image as I’d like, and there’s a delay in voice transmission. I think the mic automatically reduces the volume when the person isn’t talking to reduce background noise. When she starts to talk there’s a brief delay as it switches to higher sensitivity. But again, these are minor details that don’t affect the value of having one to communicate with your loved one.On the plus side, it does the usual Alexa things like play music, etc, etc. I love the fact that I can create a slideshow of family pictures that plays on the Show when it’s not in use. The 8” screen is adequate size and quality for this to work well.Whether you’re in the same town or across the country this makes it ridiculously easy to stay in touch. At any time, without your loved one having to do a thing. Because of this I’d give it 10 stars if I could.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2021"

But it can't compare to my new Echo Show 8.I found that when I ask it a question, it’s response on answers is far superior to what I was getting with my Google device. Plus it hears me better. The Google worked fine as long as I was sitting next to it but if I was on the other side of the room I had to shout at it for it to respond. That is not a problem with my Amazon device, I can use my normal speaking voice from anywhere in the room and it works perfectly.The sound is amazing. The speakers are probably 80% of the device so they are large they with a clear sound And offer a good amount of bass. It's really nice to just sit down and say “Alexa play Frank Sinatra.“ And it sounds just wonderful.Plus it works with Amazon prime video, I can watch movies on it, and they sound great because of the wonderful speakers.No problem integrating it with my smart switches and outlets. I come home, I say hello to it it, turns on the correct lights.

187,Gina,Great product that now angers me daily with content that I cannot disable,"  A couple of months ago or so, Amazon started putting up this ""Alexa for your day"" screen periodically on Echo show devices.  Periodically in the past, Amazon would start popping up visual content that I didn't want, but generally after poking around and reading up on the internet I could find a way to disable that.  It felt like a sort of not-so-amusing battle between me and them for control over what shows up.  One one of my devices I just want a plain black background showing just the time, date, and a small current-weather icon.  That's it.  On another I like to rotate family photos.For the most part I've had this, again, periodically having to whack-a-mole on new features that are added and helpfully ""turned on"" for me until I find out how to disable.Now this ""Alexa for your day"" thing rotates in periodically, even though I have the screen rotation feature set to off.  Customers have been complaining bitterly about this since it happened.I periodically just say ""screen off"" so I don't have to look at it, but then if I ever actually use the thing, the screen is back on again.  I can't even turn it into an oversized non-visual Echo device.I no longer trust Amazon to give me reasonable control over the screen that I bought.Don't buy one of these things.

I do like the screen and the added functions that offers but the mark was missed on this.  I have friends with this product that have the exact same experience as we do.  The sound is better than a DOT but only marginally.  Not anything close to the Echo Plus or the standard Echo.  There really is no comparison.

I like the idea of a video hub offering the option for a backlit photo frame that shuffles photos of my choice, but the never ending dialog at the bottom of the show 8 screen ruins that for me.

190,Scott ,Keep it or dump it?,"  The original unit had to be replaced before the end of the first week.  The  echo 8 kept cutting out especially when listening to news and music.  Instead of amazon replacing it with a new Echo Show 8,  I was sent a unit identified as refurbished.  How they could have refurbished units within days of the release of a new product is unclear.The replacement had a different problem.  After being on for 15 or 20 minutes, the Echo 8 refused to respond to an Alexa command. It simply stayed on with what was playing even when screaming Alexa right over it.  The Amazon technician I called couldn’t believe it either. We spent nearly an hour going back to the beginning with restoring to factory settings.  We agreed to keep it playing and have her call me after 30 minutes to see if the Alexa command could get it to stop playing.  She did call back as promised and, guess what, the fix took.  Alexa did her job.  I praised the technician for her expertise and effort and thought a new day had begun.Except it hadn’t.  The next day it was as if nothing had been done.  The Echo 8 refused to respond to the off or stop command, making it necessary to disconnect the power.A day later I am still wondering what to.  Should I call tech support and go through another remedial effort which will probably fail or should I ask for a third unit, one which is new and not refurbished?

No matter what I did would get rid of them.  When I asked Alexa to remove them, it responded with ""watch list can't be disabled"" or some variation of that statement.I went through 5 agents using both Amazon's chat feature and having them call me over a two+ hour period trying to figure out why I was having FULL SCREEN advertisements pushed through my device despite the fact that I had everything turned off except for photos and weather alerts.  They had me try everything even to the point of factory resetting my device, all to no avail.

Unlike the the Show 5, you can't change clock faces so you are stuck with the clock face that is too small to read from across a room.  There is a larger clock face that would be OK if you could keep it on the display instead of it changing to the small one periodically  no matter what settings you change.Virtually all settings must be one on the display itself.

Here goes..Overall construction, style, and appearance:5 out of 5 Stars - the device looks a lot bigger in person than in the picture, even though its dimensions are clearly listed in the description. It is simply a beautifully crafted and designed device. The picture quality is spectacular, it has a firefox browser on it, and you can look up your amazon prime video, youtube, and different video skills on it which look great.I had already read people's complaints about the ""try this ...""

Less than three mins tops. Literally plug it in and it's ready.Successful integration with calendar, email, etc, and am finding more skills to utilize.Cons:In the smart home device area, everything but my echo dots are seen and able to be controlled. My lohas smart LED lights and amazon plug are working fine from it.To use video calling you can't use video drop-in if you're device and your alexa app are connected to the same wifi network. (I disconnected my phone with the alexa app on it from my wifi network and connected to another one and video drop-in was perfect.Would be nice to disable the ring tone or sounds or display when dropping in on it, in order to use it as a monitor to check on my apartment while I'm out and not alert potential burglars of my ability to see them.

Maybe I'm looking in the wrong place?The voice response time is lagged slightly.

197,R.S.,"Wonderful look, annoying blood pressure spikes","  After about 3 months in I can honestly say Alexa please shut the +÷&%$ up.I'm a nerd and worked in IT for the majority of my life, when I say I have sworn less  at machines from 20 bucks to a quarter million or more its just a fact.I went all in to try this out, some echos, an alarm, plugs , lights, and a couple cams (blink).  Pulled out a 2.4 router and gave it its own network. While setup wasnt bad in general it was clunky with the 3rd parties but I kinda expected that. Needing to go through the site vs app on phone for plugins was a mild annoyance but ehh right. Its shiny and I just wanna try it! I expected to be pleasantly surprised with all the Alexa hype.What I did not expect, was the previously unknown reservoir of utter hate and disdain I could feel towards a friendly voice.  I could have sent it back but I want to take it out to a field and detonate it on camera. Seriously I truly loathe this chipper device with every fiber of my soul.Could it be time saving? Yes if it worked ALL the time.... and thats the issue. When it doesnt understand or goes the wrong way getting it to do what you wanted is more of a time sink than you ever saved. I wont even bother explaining how annoying it is when Alexa cant find the light but the software from the light company can on my phone since thats 3rd party and unfair.What is fair to critique is Alexas inability to truncate completely confirmations of actions it is already performing. Its like a dim toddler seeking aproval at mundane accomplishments. Yes alexa you are resuming the audiobook but if you could stop tellung me and jusy do it that would be great sweetie.Seriously, I stipped bothering to use it for one book because it had a title that was about 2 sentences and it was just killing me listening to a 10 second confirmation everytime i wanted to hear a few minutes.Second, for the love of god let me remove your dumb suggestions of what you think i might like off the botoom 25% of the screen. The screen is nice for what it is,  but if I wanted little billboards throughout my home I'd frame magazine ads, at least then I could chose.There are a ton of quirks, unfortunately changing the voice truly isn't an option.

198,LegoDad,A real letdown for Amazon.,"  I wish there was a way to rate the hardware and software aspects of this product separately.First, the good stuff. A nice bright screen and great sound from a tiny device, all at a surprisingly low price. My guess is that the device is being sold at cost or even as a loss-leader as a way for Amazon to make it easier for consumers to order products (""Amazon, order potato chips from Amazon Fresh"").The bad: it's hard to believe that the UI was made by one of the biggest IT companies on the planet. It's clunky and nonintuitive. For example, the menu options for looking at Amazon's own Prime Video app on the Echo Show only loosely correspond to the Prime Video apps that Amazon publishes for iPad, Apple TV, Roku, various smart TV's, etc. It feels like what you'd get if Apple had hired two independent teams to separately develop operating systems for the iPhone and iPad but never let those teams communicate with each other or compare notes.The integration with the Prime Video servers is also strange; items that I have deleted from my watchlist via the web or smart tv app still show up in my ""Watch next"" screen on the Echo. And it seems there is no way to hide unused/unwanted icons from the home screen (perhaps Netflix is paying a commission or fee to Amazon to appear on the home screen and thus cannot be deleted).Perhaps the most annoying feature of all is that the volume of the Alexa voice is tied to the overall volume of the device. There is no way to set Alexa's volume differently to that of TV shows, music, etc, and the Alexa voice is much MUCH louder than those other items. If the volume is increased in order to hear dialogue on a tv show, for example, the Alexa voice becomes REALLY LOUD. There should be a way to set the Alexa voice volume level separately, but there is not.I really hope Amazon spends more time working on the interface for the device because it does have a lot of potential...but they have a lot of work to do.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2020"

I wanted a small TV in the kitchen but all of them that I found I found were just too big. This fits right on top of my microwave. The sound and video quality are amazing! I'm 100% happy with mine. As far as the ""Alexa, try..."" issue that people are having I actually love! It gives me some great suggestions that I would of never thought of. It's not intrusive and it's barely even noticeable unless you are looking for it. The device comes with a ton of options too. This is my first Echo Show but I'm 100% happy with it.

200,Purchase Person,It’s OK,"  I got this because it said how well it went with Ring.  I put it in our bedroom in the event there was motion detected at night, i could easily take a quick look at the activity without having to find my glasses for my phone.  Well, it integrates with Ring, but do not expect to get anything more than a verbal  notification  as it will not connect with Ring's camera.  So, pretty much useless to me.  It does work and show other cameras i have, so maybe i need to put them next to the Ring's...  seems sad to think about.As a side note, The Alexa app, echo's and this show has failed me in many connections from August door lock to the current Ring issues.  I don't see the value that others see in these items.Update:  after fiddling for weeks to try and get a ring camera picture to no avail, I have finally gotten it. I do not know how. Amazon Support called and left message yesterday. Today I went to look at the echo to be better able to explain the issue (I am assuming that is why they called) and one camera was showing on the screen.  Now about a week ago one camera went through an activation and I thought perhaps a firmware update as I have had no problems with the Ring doorbell camera itself  Once I saw that camera working I manually did another camera activate This morning and lo and behold, the picture showed up on the echo show!

I like that world wide things come across the screen, when our packages will/have been delivered, news and suggestions of “Try, Alexa....” and comes up with with different ways to use Alexa! The music plays really well on it, i love being able to ask Alexa to play music while I do dishes or cleaning around the house, especially when i can ask her to play a specific song! Even the suggestions on “learn how to make this food!” Which gives us more suggestions on foods I haven’t even thought about. Plus the weather for the day and just minor things Alexa can do! I think it’s great it rotates with different things and we can still see the time at the top corner. I’ve been recommending it to everyone! Main reason we bought it was so we could see our ring cameras and the quality is amazing! (Note: we started with the compact version and didn’t love it, only because it was so small.

202,ELH,Two Defective Devices,"  We have Amazon devices throughout our house. No problems with any whatsoever.We had the echo show 5 for about a year and loved it. We decided we wanted to upgrade and purchased an echo show 8. The echo show was great until it started sounding muffled when playing music on both the alexa music platform and spotify. I had to call customer service three times to get my device replaced. They made me troubleshoot and such only to replace my one month old device with a refurbished device!!! And, the stupid refurbished device is having the same problem. I go online and run a search and it looks like this is an ongoing issue that has not been fixed. I'm really disappointed in my purchase. Prior to having issues with my new echo 8, we decided to order a second echo show 8 which happened to be back ordered. Just received and connected a few days ago.

203,minty & kevin,"Frustrating, flawed, lacking, inferior, incapable...MEDIOCRE product at best!","  I would recommend a HARD PASS for now.  The Echo Show technology is completely underwhelming.  Half the time Alexa does not understand the request.  Sure, the Show can turn on a light, but so can the Echo - I've got an Echo in every room (as well as multiple plugs) but thought I'd give the Show a try.  One of the reasons I wanted the Show was so that I could see my kitchen timer(s).  Well, you can see the timer on the screen for about 8 seconds before it disappears and you have to ask to 'display timer' again.  REPEATEDLY!  There's no way to keep it on the screen.  Seriously?!  When I'm timing my french press, I have to keep asking to display the timer.  If you're not playing music, it will display a tiny timer in the top right corner of the home screen, but that often displays incorrectly.  (It displays on top of itself when the image changes on the home screen so that two timers are layered on each other, slightly askew making it useless.)  The image display is also 99% uncustomizable.  I've selected the Scenery setting.  If you don't like an image and forward to the next one, it holds that for a few seconds and then stops on the next one for 10 minutes or longer.  It somehow always cycles back to the images you swiped through.  It clearly doesn't learn preferences.  The clock randomly switches display locations from a small one in the upper-left to a larger one in the lower-left.  How about Amazon's own music service?  You'd think it would integrate nicely with this, but no.  When Alexa doesn't understand what song or album you're asking for *after multiple attempts*, there's no way to type in a search for what you want.  Additionally, the controls disappear unless you tap the screen.  If you prefer to use the touch screen to *tap* back a track or some other command (rather than speaking the request), you have to tap the screen twice and the Show VERY sluggishly responds -- there's nothing quick about this unit.  Once it displayed my connected Ecobee t-stat, but ever since that one time, it has no idea what I'm asking for.  I've attempted every conceivable spoken command to view my thermostat.  At least the various Echo units will tell you the thermostat temp.  I haven't tried it to facetime friends that have an Echo Show, but most people have phones for doing this so it's more of a novelty.  The Show is constantly making recommendations on the home screen of things I should try, but yet for the majority of requests Alexa responds, ""I'm not quite sure how to help you with that."" Overall, there are very few aspects of the interface that you can control and customize.  It's almost entirely subject to the random and non-intuitive programming of the designers.Amazon's technology is breaking no new ground -- nothing innovative here!  For a company with such deep pockets, I'm always surprised at how awful their tech can be.  They recently updated the firetv interface.  It's now one of the worst interfaces I've ever had the displeasure of using!  To get to your 'saved shows', you now need to tap a total of ten times.  Free-to-me, Store, Channels, and Categories are some of the things you have to tap through to get to 'My Stuff'.  Shouldn't My Stuff be rated more highly than Categories?!  Again, frustrating!  That will be my next review.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2021"
204,CB1288,This Device Does NOT Have the Full-Screen Changeable Clock Face,"  Here's why I'm giving it 1 star. The Echo 5 has a clock face you can change, make analog or digital, have different colors, etc; it's the cool feature you see on all the commercials. The Echo 8 (this device) does not have that functionality, it only has a small 1/2"" clock that appears on the top left of the screen. This device also has this ""Try this on Alexa"" recommendation on the bottom of the screen that changes every 10 seconds or so; you cannot get rid of this, there is NOT currently a setting to remove it. Also the skill to control Amazon music is seriously lacking, all you can do is pause music or forward/reverse to the next song. I was hoping for more functionality like you get from the tablet or phone app.I was going to return this but decided to put it next to my kid's computer, they'll enjoy the picture slideshow functionality.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 24, 2019"

Maybe it's changed, but I only see those when I'm not using the echo, at which point I tell the echo to turn on the display and it all goes away. Not something that should be complained about in my opinion.I love the echo for what I use it for. It's in my kitchen and I turn on prime video while I do my normal routine and while cooking. I feel it makes my kitchen time more enjoyable. I have yet to use the recipes features, but I've heard it's very convenient. It does everything I wanted it to do, so for me it's worth every penny.The sound quality is great for my space.

208,Super Simi,I love having my Echo Shows. We use them often everyday. These would also make great gifts.,"  This has been such a great addition to my home! I have four Echo Show devices now and I use them everyday. Mine are all set to display the time, date, and weather.My favorite part of the Echo Show devices are the screens because I can use them as digital photo frames. First I uploaded my photos to Amazon Photos. For pictures on my computer and various hard drives I used the website to upload them. For photos on my phone and tablet I used the Amazon Photos app to upload. I created an album called ""Screensaver"" and then set all my Echo Shows to display the album. (Settings -> Wallpaper & Clock -> Select Amazon Photos.) The Echo Shows all display different pictures from the selected album. I have never caught them displaying the same picture at the same time.It took time for me to create the album, but you can start slowly and add whenever you have time or whenever you have new photos. I have photos from years ago up to today in the album. It's so wonderful when the pictures pop up and being reminded of the moment. I often stop to look at the pictures and they always bring a smile to my face.... I have photos of my family, friends, all my pets, the dearly departed.... decades old memories as well as new and fresh memories. Pictures of my dogs when they were puppies, my children when they were tiny, special events, everyday moments.... so nostalgic and yes, very sentimental. This has been great for someone like me who has a poor memory. I have a hard time remembering yesterday!Random stuff and skill suggestions popping up on the home screen can be disabled. Go to Settings -> Home Content and deselect the skills you don't care for. I found that after software updates I would have to go back to deselect skills because new ones were added, such as Covid related skills. The only skill I have showing on mine right now is the weather.Another feature that I use everyday is the speaker groups. This allows me to play an audio on the group of speakers, all synced up perfectly, so that when I go room to room the audio is there (wherever there is a device). In the Amazon Alexa app, go to ""Devices"", tap the + icon on the top right corner, select ""Add Group"", name your group, then select the devices to add to the group. The devices have to all be on the same network for this to work. So if my group name is ""All Devices"", everyday I can say, ""Alexa, play NPR on All Devices"", or ""Alexa, play Spotify on All Devices"", or similar. You can also control the group volume by saying, ""Alexa, volume (down to 3) / (up to 6) / (mute) / (max) on All Devices"". Saying ""Alexa, stop"" will stop the audio on the whole group.I can also use the announcement feature. ""Alexa, make an announcement: 10 more minutes to get ready."" And Alexa will announce it to the other devices. If you have other people in your ""Amazon Household"" (other Amazon accounts linked to yours, not necessarily in the same household) who also have devices, they will be able to hear your announcements and they can also make announcements to your devices. So using this you could communicate short messages to another household, like a walkie talkie. There is also the Drop In feature which I haven't tried, but I read that it could be used to monitor another room, to check in on your home and pets, to chat with others, etc.One of the favorite skills that my children really enjoy is ""Amazon Storytime"". I use it as a reward and incentive. Sometimes they will tell jokes with Alexa (Alexa, knock knock.....), or ask Alexa questions (Alexa, where did dogs come from?). They also use the timer and alarm feature often. ""Alexa, set an alarm for 5:00pm."" ""Alexa, set a timer for 45 minutes."" Alexa can have multiple timers and alarms going at the same time.The Echo Show 8"" and 5"" devices have the camera cover, but the Echo Show 10"" does not. For my Echo Show 10"" I stuck a few layers of sticky note over the camera.Overall, I love having my Echo Shows. But I'm not made of money, so I have only ever purchased these during super sale events, like Prime Day. If I had to pay the original price, I'm not sure I'd even have one single device. Having said that, these would make great gifts if the receiver could utilize the various features.Update: you can watch Hulu on this by adding the skill to your Amazon Alexa account. This also has bluetooth.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2020"
209,Amazon Customer,No Middle Child Syndrome Here - Step up from 5 and 10 & gives the benefits of both,"  The Echo 8 may be getting a bad rap being in the middle of two other pretty cool Echo Shows. But for me, having multiple ""5s"" around, this larger screen and even bigger sound brought me joy. Video calling was great with the 5, but wow, video calling on the 8 is really cool and requires less shifting the device around to keep up with us folks constantly moving around. My only regret was purchasing this on a pre-order bundled with another Echo Show 5 at a discount. But ultimately, cost me a lot of money. Suddenly Amazon dropped the price of this one to less than $100. Kind of screwed all those who pre-ordered it at full price. Lesson learned - I will not be the early bird on new devices, because that ate my future Echo Show 10 money. Lo and behold, during Black Friday, the Echo Show 10 dropped to $149, and I jumped on it. A month later, and I am still frustrated with the full size 10 and have a return request open because it drops constantly and becomes unresponsive. The Echo 8 has blown the 10 away and sounds just as good.

I read the reviews, pro and con, and decided a lot of smoke was being blown.  The unit came registered to me, and connected to my network without any problems, along with updating the software. The voice recognition software tailored itself to my voice without any problems, and I've yet to repeat myself. The display is crisp and the colors are excellent, and for those who complain about what is displayed that they don't want, get over it, listen to the excellent quality music it's capable of producing instead.  I like the changing backgrounds when it's idle and just ignore the ""Try..."" messages.  The one thing that really rocks is that lyrics are displayed for the vast majority of the songs that you might listen to, just think, you might discover something you didn't know about a song or two.  I can live with the changing clock (from center screen to upper left), but the advantage is knowing what the weather is like outside.  I will admit, though, that I liked the first one so much that I bought a second one.  You might find this is such a nice unit that you might end up with more than one also.  Would I recommend it?

I definitely would NOT get this again because the screen really isn't useful for anything. You have to do almost everything with voice control, and most things don't have much you need the video for. Just walking up and touching the screen will get you nothing. You can go through all of the touch features in about 30 seconds.I also have a Google Home Hub with the display. It's light years better. It's functional and nice, even if you never talk to it. You can swipe through videos, access all your smart home controls, show news clips, etc.  I use Alexa throughout my house, but the google home hub is so good I keep it around.I'm amazed how many good reviews the echo show has, because it really isn't good.

212,Larry  Michalski,Not Enough User Control and Does Alexa Really Speak English?,"  So, I'm an admitted late adopter, as in I bought my first echo dot in late 2019. I loved the sound and ease to play music and ask questions so much I thought, ""Why not get an Echo Show? I'm sure it'll be even more fun than the dot."" Ummm....nope. For me, it basically does the same thing, but costs more and seems to understand my commands less than my dot. I have to repeat things WAY MORE than I do for the dot and, even more annoying, it seems to sometimes guess what I'm saying and do something 100000000% different than my request. Here are some examples:ME: ""Alexa, play songs by Anjulie.""Echo Show: ""Ok, playing songs by Julie Andrews""ME: ""Alexa, read me a poem by a poet from the Romantic era""ES: I can't (or something like that.)ME: (exasperated) ""Alexa, read me a romantic poem""ES: ""Ok, reading from Audible, The Tales of Peter Rabbit, by Beatrix Potter""And, I have so many more examples like this. Try asking a question about something beyond the weather or simple conversions and she'll at best post some internet sites for you to read. Ugh. I can do that with my laptop or my phone or, like most normal people do...at work!What else? Well, Alexa likes to stay on. Meaning, when it's bedtime or I'm leaving for the day, there's no way I know to make the screen go black, you know to at least appear like Amazon isn't listening to me snore.And, more, like hundreds of reviews and even more people on other websites say, I HATE the constant scroll of ideas to try with Alexa and you can't turn it off. How about ""Alexa, try working like your owners want you to work""?And, there's even more this ES should do, but doesn't. If you're listening to music, that's it. You can't do anything else on your ES. If you say the wake word, the music mutes and Alexa waits for your question. If it requires a new screen, your music stops. Greeeaaatttt....even my Android phone and Windows laptop play Pandora AND, ironically, Amazon Music in the background unless I'm doing something that requires the mic, like talking on the phone...maybe even to Amazon customer service.Anyway, here's just one of the ways this single mode thing with the ES is really annoying. Alexa ALWAYS wants you to use her for recipes. Guess what: Want to cook w/Alexa? I hope you either have a photographic memory or don't want to listen to music, because you can't look at the recipe and listen to music at the same time. Annoying, right?So, what do I actually like about my ES? Well, I like the sound quality. For the price and size, and perhaps because I'm not too picky, the music that comes from the Show's speaker(s?) is nice. It's just not always the song I asked it to play.I also like the one thing I've found contradictory to its single mode mantra and that's that, if available, the ES will scroll the lyrics to the song it's playing. And, again, like I mentioned above, you might need those if Alexa surprises you with a Julie Andrews' song.I have until the end of the month to decide if I want to keep this ES. I'm still not sure. I thought it would have a clock display. It doesn't. Ok, actually, I thought it would have a display showing a minimal looking clock, day/date, and temperature. Yeah, no. Instead, those are each individual commands and don't stay on the screen long or together. Though, know what does have that all on one screen? You guessed it, my phone. Maybe I should return the ES and just mount a cell phone to an Echo Dot.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2020"

But the standard Echo sounds fairly good (though not as good). Do I really need a video screen? There are two big pluses to having the screen. Being able to make video calls to friends and family who also have an Echo Show is a nice to have feature. But what I really love is loading all my photography into Amazon storage and having the Echo Show shuffle my 50 years of photographic memories in a continuous picture show. In between the display of personal photos, the unit displays news and weather updates from your favorite news source.

BUT now the 4 is 100, not 50, and on top of it all, for the first time in years, Amazon has decided to wait til they RECEIVE it to credit me for it (though they credited the DOT purchased by mistake and everything else I've returned in the past 2+ years) so I am STILL on terminal hold.I will not be funding any more of Alexa's BS.

Just a bad design choice.  Its voice recognition isn't any better than my gen 1 device and it still ""chimes in"" that its expecting an interaction when nobody said its wake word.  Messaging still requires access to your phone, which is ridiculous and not going to happen.  It frequently asks me to confirm which device I want to turn on or off even though it heard me correctly according to the history in the app.  Why the hell does it have to repeat every question back to me before answering?  Just give me the damn answer!!  Very frequently its ""I found something on the web"" answers are nonsensical and blatantly wrong.

Although she did still sound great, sometimes she had a bit of trouble hearing and we found ourselves yelling and repeating ourselves one too many times, it was time to send her to the old hobby closet.This echo show 8 is very nice, it was super easy to set up and the picture quality and sound are excellent. Alexa responds quickly and I don't have to yell or repeat myself making my neighbors think a crazy lady lives here. I'm also happy I chose the 8 instead of the smaller 5. I enjoy the screen size, and along with a nice magnetic swivel stand I bought to go with it, it looks and fits great on the end table. It would also work great on the kitchen counter or anywhere else in the house.This echo works great with our security system, I just ask Alexa to ""show me -name of camera-"" and it's super easy to make calls and check your calendar and emails if you need to. Running smart home controls is also easy to do. Touch screen and voice control are both very responsive. I also love the slide lock button to block the camera when it's not in use, it kept me from having to place one more piece of black tape over a camera lens!The lighting also dims (can turn feature off in settings) as it gets darker so it doesn't light up the room at night. However you can still see the time dimly lit from across the room, I like this feature so I haven't checked to see if you can remove the time from showing when it's dark.I'm still getting to know what I can and cannot do with this echo show, but so far I'm loving it and I have no regrets whatsoever with my purchase.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2019"
219,Rosie,Very nice but not quite there,"  I've had the echo show 8 since April.  I like it a lot.  When the display is working it's clear and easy to read.  It responds just like the regular echo and echo dots I have around the house.  I purchased it to replace an alarm clock that had too many buttons and was a pain to program.  The echo show is simple to program using voice commands and the alarms are easy to respond to via voice command.Where it falls short is that the display just goes blank at times.  No clock display, no background images, nothing.  In order to get it back I can wait until it decides to come back to life on its own, or I can ask it what the temperature is, or some other query where the reply contains an image.  Then it works just fine until it decides not to anymore.Would I buy it again?  Yes.  Would I like a software update to fix the zombie mode display?  Yes.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2021"
220,Meaux L,UPDATE: AMAZON helped me fix my problem with great service!,"  My original review is below, but it turns out that I needed to change the wake word for the Echo Show. Amazon resolved this issue within an hour of my complaint. Now I am very happy with the Echo Show 8!ORIGINAL INCORRECT REVIEW: My new Echo Show 8 is 2 feet from me. My Echo Dot is in a room 15 feet away. About half the time, the Echo Show indicates that it is hearing my command, but the Dot in the other room responds to it. Makes it annoyingly useless to me. Also, it won't respond to commands to stop playing music, again probably a microphone issue. Will probably be returning it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2019"

With the whole house music option you can stream the same song to multiple location around the house.  Best thing is it works well most of the time....My two cents is if you don't plan to connect an external stereo you are better off looking at the other devices on the market because again ""Alexa is stupid"" .

Great feature.Having difficulty with Alexa in general when playing music on a speaker group. The only way I can make it work is to say, ""Alexa play music on -speaker group-"". I can't tell Alexa to play a particular genre or band on a speaker group. It just doesn't work.You Tube is NOT on Echo 8. It tells you to open it via internet browser ""Firefox"".

229,Habernewton,Quite an Upgrade Over the ECHO,"  We have been using an ECHO unit for about 3 years and have been very happy with it. With the recent version 2 upgrade to the ECHO Show, and with the recent addition of grandchildren living 8 hours away, we decided to try the Show 8 out.The unit installation was a super simple plug-an-play using the Alexa app. Amazon has certainly made the start up for their products super simple. We moved the ECHO to the master bedroom, and the ECHO Dot to a different location.After 2 weeks we are VERY happy with it. We are able to do visual phone calls with our son and family (they upgraded to a Show 8, also). We have  added the Recipe Speak skill, uploaded a lot of our recipes, and like the visual functionality. We use Our Groceries (we love it) and can now get a visual on what is on the list(s). There are other things we are trying as we learn what can be done.The sounds seems to be very good, also. The better sound may be a function of the unit sitting in a corner up against two walls.Why 4 versus 5 stars?  The ECHO Show 8's bottom is set so that the screen tilts backward slightly; there is no way to adjust this tilt. Because of the location of our unit we either have to stand up to look straight into the screen for a phone call or prop the back up with a small block so we can sit down. Adjustable stands are available, and we will order one, but I think that some type of tilt device, even a very simple one, should come with the unit.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2020"
230,linda,Good for checking Ring Cameras,"  I got a Ring doorbell for Christmas, but unfortunately, my house is run by Google.  Ads stated that Ring worked with Google.  IT DOES NOT.  So, After installation and the discovery that the Ring does not work with Google, I had to go buy an Alexa so I can see who is at the front door.  I can use my phone, but I don't carry it around with me in my house.  Alexa immediately responds to ""Alexa, show me the front door camera"".  Whereas, my phone requires I reactivate it when I want to see who is out front, delaying the view by about 15 seconds. When the chime alerts me, I can go to the Echo 8 to see who is at the door.  I have my Google Max which also doubles as a security camera.  I wish the Echo Show 8 did that.  It has a camera and could be a security camera like my Google Max.  So, I have to buy a second Echo for another floor of the house and another camera for the same room as Echo doesn't show the Google camera.  Now I have Echo equipment around the house for the cameras and Google for everything else including working as a security camera.  I wish these two companies would kiss and make up.Update:I use the Alexa for checking on my Ring cameras.  Also it constantly offers other things to look at, although they are mostly very liberal news outlets.  It doesn't always recognize the devices throughout my house by the names I gave them on my phone app.  Consequently, I have many ""Switch"" devices that I actually had given more detailed names.  Also, where I place them in groups don't always translate from my phone to the Show 8.  Again, consequently, I have to search through ""devices"" to find some things.  I thought paying extra for ""Ring"" cameras was a good idea.  Gosund plugs which are supposed to work with google and alexa, both don't recognize the names I give these plugs, so phone, kindle, guest light etc. all appear as ""switch"". Google recognizes some names and Alexa recognize some others.  It is messy.  Best to use the phone.  I bought three Alexa Echo 8 show devices to use on each floor of my house for easy to see groups and devices.  Unfortunately, the camera group which I wanted to just click or say that once and turn all of them off or on, somehow randomly adds another device that I don't want in the camera group, so I have to individually request on and off for each device.  I have tried moving the devices back where I originally put them, but doesn't go.  Also, my Google Max works as a security camera.  I wish the Alexa did that.  I would have three extra cameras in the house!  When I get a camera alert on Alexa, it goes away quickly.  I try to get Alexa to tell me again where the alert came from, but it won't go back. So I have to ask to see each camera to figure it out or go to my phone to see history. By then, whoever is there is gone.  I wish it would give me some time to see where the alert was.  Chime uses the same sound for every camera, so I don't know which one it was unless I was standing right next to the Alexa Echo 8 Show when it showed the alert for 10 seconds.Bottom line is that the Alexa is good for checking my cameras, although slower to pull up the camera than I would like.  Usually the driver is already back in the car by the time I get the camera view going, so I can't say thank you or anything else.  Lots of junk like recipes and news constantly on the Echo that I don't care about.  More interested in quickly showing me the cameras, which takes way too long.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2021"

232,Shannon Brousseau,Funciona Bastante Bien pero hay que mejorar,"  El Echo Show tiene un sonido que superó mis expectativas, el reconocimiento de voz esta bastante bien, aunque en ocasiones dice el nombre con quien habla y en otras ocasiones duda un poco sin razón.Pero el software requiere mejorar algunos detalles que son importantes, entre otras cosas. No es posible escuchar una playlist de Spotify en forma aleatoria. Esto  debería ser una función básica. Es aburrido escuchar una playlist siempre en el mismo orden.Cuando le preguntas a Alexa como me llamo, debería haber una opción de que diga solo el nombre de quien le habla. No hace falta que mencione de quien es la cuenta (pero siempre lo hace). Así le da mas personalidad a cada persona.EN mi echoshow tengo 2 voces registradas, la mía y de mi esposa, pero la configuración de Voces Reconocidas de la app, no indica cuales son estas voces. Y por lo tanto tampoco puede relacionar los perfiles de voz.

233,N.A.,Not quite what we hoped for,"  Since having an Echo Dot, and enjoying it, we added to it by purchasing the Show.  I'm glad we opted for the smaller, less expensive 8"" model, since it doesn't seem to be quite worth the hype.The sound quality is horrible, very muffled, and since the speaker is on the back it is quite difficult to hear/understand.  And trying to activate it usually requires almost yelling (within a 3 foot distance), whereas the Dot can clearly hear and understand a spoken word from across a room.Using the same requests as the Dot will give the same results (tell me a joke, what's the weather, etc.), but we have yet to figure out how to get the Show to play anything (like videos or television programs, or movies).  When trying to find a menu, the voice commands are useless (like talking to a third-grader) and attempting to utilize the touch menu doesn't take you anywhere since it seems to be ""stuck"" at giving you only 2-3 options.Bottom line - It doesn't seem to have any more ""useful"" skills than the Dot, so...  at the moment, it's just a Dot with a screen that does nothing more than show pretty changing pictures.  <sigh>  Disappointing, but not worth trying to return it, as it may be user error.  MUCH better instructions would be extremely helpful!UPDATE:  Since posting my review, Amazon tech support reached out to me.  While performing various checks and tests of the Show, the tech support rep & I were discussing what I had hoped it would do and what it was capable of doing.  Rachel (the rep) was most helpful and completely honest with me - instead of attempting to talk me into keeping it, she made the correct call that I wasn't really impressed or happy with the capabilities and we agreed it would be best if I returned it.  She then made sure it was a smooth, easy return process, setting it up and sending me a return label via email.  I was VERY impressed that she didn't turn ""salesman"" on me and try to sell me something ""instead"" of the Show, instead simply giving me options based on what I had wanted this to do.  Overall, I would give Rachel & Amazon's tech support a solid ""10"".  The Show will be returned, and I will continue looking for something I can set up in my kitchen that utilizes apps instead of skills!",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2020"
234,SoggyNacho,It's okay but could be better,"  Not sure if I should be rating the echo specifically or how it integrates, which is really more of an Alexa over all thing but here goes. Truthfully, the little dots have better sound quality than the echo show 8. I was really disappointed with the sound quality. I do like that it has a manual button to turn off the camera and you can see that it is off. I feel like that is important. You can look and see the camera is not on rather than just hoping the device does what it is supposed to. One thing I do not like is that it is angled up. A LOT! So it is really inconvenient. You are pretty much forced to buy the special stand at $30 just to be able to angle it downward to a useful angle. So when I try to video call someone, my camera is pretty much pointing up at the ceiling. Amazon really screwed that up. Regarding Alexa, I feel like the voice feature is touchier on this echo show than it is on the dots. We have dots all over our house...almost every room. Those dots do not get things wrong anywhere near as often as this echo show so keep in mind that it really does vary from device to device. I have several dots but one of our dots pretty much gets everything we say wrong, or it often answers with ""Hmmm, I don't know that one."" Also regarding this Echo Show 8.... why can't I have more control over the apps that are on my app screen? Amazon needs to step up their game so that more applications are usable.  Also, it is very touchy when it comes to ambient light. You room can be well lit, but the device does not recognize it. Alexa is also prone to losing one of my smart light bulbs. I have four but one keeps getting lost. Probably a defective bulb though rather than an Alexa thing.Overall, it was a good purchase and I am not sorry I got it because it does a much better job with video call quality than facebook messenger or iphone facetime. That said, I do often go to the room with a dot in it for voice commands because the show seems to be stupid. It's like the difference between asking your two year old a question, and asking your 17 year old. Seriously. It's pretty significant. I can say, if Amazon doesn't step up their game on allowing more applications, I will switch to google. This has been around for a while. It needs to stop offering stupid garbage like ""Alexa, tell me a dog joke,"" or ""Alexa, ruin my day,"" and start adding compatible applications or at the very least, fix the problems with supposedly Alexa compatible hardware that isn't. So as you can see, my bigger issues are more with Alexa software than the Echo Show specifically, but after using it for a month or two, the few things I have listed in here are the only concerns I have had. ** Oh, and in case this is a factor for you, it is 5G compatible. My echo show functions well on both my 2.4 ghz connection as well as my 5G connection provided by my cable company. **",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2020"

Everything looked brand new, as that’s what I selected at Checkout. Not renewed or used. It shows new on the receipt on my orders and on the piece of paper that was in the Amazon box it arrived in. The packaging was not damaged, and there was a protective film over the Show. Everything was intact visually. However, the Echo Show was registered to a different person’s account somehow?? I won’t put their name on this review for their privacy, however, I must admit I was a bit shocked at first as this is not something I expect from a tech giant such as Amazon. Very odd.

I only rate 2 stars on voice recognition and 1 star on sound quality because my first one has issues. When I give it commands half the time it doesn’t respond or it locks up and starts playing in a loop (repeats itself) and I have to reboot. When I ask it to play music, 75% of the time it sounds like a tin box, requiring a reboot to fix it. It had some other issues last November but they seem to be resolved. I’ve contacted Amazon a handful of times, state my issues, then I’m asked to wait a moment, then they don’t come back. Last time I let my phone sit there waiting while watching a movie, an hour later still no response, I texted hello, any one there? Waited then texted again...nothing. So if you have warranty, Amazon doesn’t come through on it. Such a waste of money.My second one is great.

The thing about the Sony Dash was that it completely sucked! The interface was clunky, the home screen was not customizable and the video playback was always choppy. After a few years Sony stopped supporting the device all together and it became a paper weight. This was probably somewhere in 2008-2009. Well, ten years later I just picked up the Amazon Echo 8 and I blown away at how awesome it is! The sound quality is GREAT! The screen is beautiful! The ease of use is amazing.

My daughter had briefly moved her dot in her room and we discovered me using the show in the kitchen (near her room) was setting off her dot too, so she moved hers back and away from her door.I've been playing music (spotify) in my office and walked into the kitchen to see if it would play on both devices, or what would happen. It picked up where the office one left off, the office one stopped, but when I went back into the office (much later), what was playing in the kitchen did not start in the office. It's not a big enough deal to me to go see how to fix it, but in case anyone was wanting that functionality, you may want to look that up.I'm pleased with the size, I was hoping I wouldn't regret not getting the larger one, but I don't.

240,Extraordinary Acoustics (Guitar Shop),Not worth having without Netflix,"  This device is basically an Amazon dictator in a box - you'll take exactly what we give you and nothing more, and you'll take it exactly the way we give it to you. The most major frustrations include:Lack of adjustability - for a device that cost me $50, I can't stress how ridiculous it is that I then have to pay another $25 for a STAND to be able to adjust the angle at which the device sits on my table. Really?Lack of sound quality - the speakers on this device do not face the front, so the sound...doesn't come from the front of the device. This makes it difficult to hear voices clearly if you're trying to keep the volume low.Lack of Netflix - this is the biggest and most frustrating one. First, there is no Netflix app (more on that in a minute). Beyond that, even if you go to Netflix.com in either browser and log in, clicking Play on any video puts you into a loop that just keeps taking you back to the same Netflix page saying ""Get the free app."" This is incredibly annoying to me that Amazon is so insecure about Prime Video that they won't even allow you to watch a competing service through a web browser. The thing is, Amazon, you're not really competing with Netflix - you complement them. I guarantee if I didn't have Prime I wouldn't subscribe separately to Prime Video, so when you're giving me the service with my membership, why do you force the ""free"" service as my only real video option?That being said, I had what I guess was some kind of anomaly last night which I can't duplicate this morning. I had tried opening Netflix in Firefox, and got into the loop I describe above. Last night, I decided to try the Silk browser, and I had a different experience. As you can see in the screenshot, my Echo DID open a Netflix app and allow me to watch videos, and it did it using A NETFLIX APP ON THE DEVICE. However, once I returned to the Home screen, I am unable to get back to this Netflix app. Now, going through the same steps in Silk puts me into that same loop where it just keeps taking me back to the same page on Netflix. Asking Alexa to ""Open Netflix"" says ""that video service is not yet available on Echo Show.""I cannot stress how disappointing this device is, but enabling the Netflix app would make it a 4-star device for me. I don't know if they're just testing and I lucked out for one moment and got a working link to the Netflix app, but CLEARLY, Amazon can not say that a Netflix app doesn't exist for this device.What gives, Amazon?",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2020"
241,Common Cents,About a 9-iron short of a birdie.,"  After 10 months of use, here’s the verdict; it’s not great at a few tasks/functions at which it NEEDS to be great.1) the microphone array is horribly ineffective when the Echo Show 8 placed on a counter, near a back wall. And I mean within 12” of a back wall. It gets *even worse* when you act like a normal person and put it on a kitchen counter, under a cabinet, and near the back wall. I just had it try to give me information on National Cat Herding Day, 5 times in a row when I was just trying to run a routine that requires me to say “Good morning, it’s *my name* “. Ridiculous. It makes the device unusable for its intended purpose.2) the speakers, when in the same set of positions (near any rear wall, and on a kitchen counter under the cabinets, near the rear wall) sound bloated, tubby, and muffled. The bass output is just far too high and even when you turn the bass EQ slider down to its minimum setting, it’s still WAY too much bass. Diana Ross sounds like Barry White.So, in many respects, this beautiful device is unusable because it can’t understand me when I speak slowly and *CLEARLY* and I often cannot understand it when it responds. The second part isn’t usually as horrible because it so often responds with weird, completely unrelated things compared to my commands. See above.So, maybe moving the microphones onto the front of the baffle would help? Certainly permitting an EQ profile from 250hz and down that would permit boundary operation as opposed to free air.I’m actually an Audio Engineering Society member, and retired professional Audio engineer. Also an avid audiophile. So I’m technically an expert about these things of which I speak (no sarcasm).So, due to the consistently poor performance in these two critical areas, I’m forced to rate this one star and to tell you to avoid it if you’re going to use it near a back wall or on a kitchen counter.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2020"
242,Mallory Johnston,My current take on the show and alexa.,"  I now have a 5 and an 8 and my review will be for both plus feedback for alexa in general. The screens are cool but it's a bit annoying that I can't get rid of the alexa tips on the screen. I know there are things I can ask alexa to do that I don't know about but a tutorial section I can go to would be enough. I wish I had the same cool backgrounds on the 8 that I have on the 5, although I do like that I can use my pics from facebook. The shows misunderstand me quite a bit more than the echoes. It can be frustrating. I'll ask for volume to set to 5 and be told that I can only set on a scale of 1 - 10, or ask for 6 and get 9. One example but not the only times I get misunderstood. Also, despite having it set to ""brief"" I still feel like she can be a bit too long winded. I'll ask for music on ""everywhere"" and the song is 10 seconds in on the other devices before she's done talking. Then there are things that only need to be said once or not at all. If I ask for music everywhere then I don't need to be told it's playing everywhere. The fact that it's playing everywhere is all I need.I wish alexa were better at learning. If I verbally ask for shuffle or repeat, for example on the white noise skill that I use, she'll boldly announce that she'll remember the setting for next time but that has never been the case on any of the devices. I always have to turn shuffle or repeat back on from playlist to playlist even. The speaker on the 5 is abysmal but the 8 is actually pretty good. As good as or better than the echoes. The 5 is basically a glorified alarm clock. Speaking of the white noise skills, they can be really hard on the speakers. It's odd that Amazon would allow a skill to be developed that can damage its devices.I wish there were better integration of 3rd party devices. My cameras are geeni and I can't view them through the shows. I can't even verbally control them except for turning them on/off.Then there are things I feel like they should do but can't. For example, if music is playing on only one device, I wish I could say ""expand to everywhere"" or somesuch and have the music switch to everywhere, or vice versa. Instead, I have to ask everything to start over. I also wish I could connect to everywhere with bluetooth. This is an issue I've had since the beginning. I want to be able to play the music that is natively on my phone on everywhere.I wish I could watch more than just prime video on the shows. Considering how common it is that screen based smart devices come with the whole gamut of streaming apps, it's odd to me that the shows do not offer this. I know my review sounds largely negative but I do like the show and the potential it has. This review is meant to be constructive.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2020"

244,Jerry Nowlin,Bigger but not at lot  better...than the the Echo 5. Worse in some cases,"  If your main reason for buying the Echo 8 is a bigger screen, go for it.  It does that about as well as you would expect.  Everything else, except perhaps sound quality, puts it behind the Echo 5 in terms of quality and extras.The screen, while larger, seems a bit washed out to me, compared to the 5. You have far fewer customization options in terms of clock faces and backgrounds.  You would expect better sound quality given the larger cabinet and (presumably) larger speaker. But it's really not that much better. Marginally perhaps.Also, since it has a bigger screen and the same wedge form factor as the 5, the entire device is much much larger, which might not make it suitable in places where space is at a premiumI wanted it mainly for the kitchen, for calling up recipes, which are easier to see, with less scrolling, than on the smaller Echo 5 screen. Mission accomplished there, although it is so large, it barely fits where I wanted to put. And was a bit disappointed at all the other downgrades.One upside it it seems to handle wakeup better than the 5. Not sure why but the 5 always seemed a bit hard of hearing.  Perhaps because I have so many other Alexa devices scattered about the house and they were all fighting for control. The whole ESP thing that is supposed to make the closest one respond didnt work very well with the 5. This one is very responsive unless there is a lot of ambient noise.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2019"
245,Notorious HOBG,Highly disappointing to showcase pictures,"  I got this device with the sole intent to display my pictures stored on Amazon Drive, and it is a very disappointing experience.* The setup was not very straight forward. Clearly displaying pictures is a side option, not the main point of this device.* Pictures are displayed in the inverted order they have been stored online (most recent ones 1st). There is no shuffling/randomization option. I have over 50,000 pictures so that was a BIG disappointment as I would have loved to be ""surprised"" by which picture comes next.* Picture displaying speed never changed despite changing the settings on the device.* The device got stuck on 1 picture after ~1 week of use. Once I restarted it no pictures were displayed at all, despite still being connected to my amazon account. Clearly some low quality programming here.* I couldn't get rid of the AI interface even if I will never use it. The best I could do is turn off the camera and microphone. But I get a very visible red band at the bottom of the screen and occasional written messages on the screen to ""entice"" me to use the AI (""Have you tried saying ..."").* This is very surprising, knowing that competitor devices have been able to display pictures for years very well. Very much feels like getting a flip phone when you ordered a smartphone.* I couldn't find another device to display my pictures stored on Amazon drive. This is making me consider moving them back to another cloud provider.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2020"
246,Ms. Donna,I love my Echo Show 8!!!,"  Bought this for myself. I already have an Echo Show and the Echo Show 5 and love them. The Echo Show 8 is a perfect compromise between the Echo Show and Echo Show 5. The larger 8 inch screen is great if you have poor eyesight and the sound quality is amazing for a device of this size. We started out placing an Echo in every room; now, we have Echo Shows in 3 of the 5. Amazon has done an excellent job continuing to update and add features to the Echo Show. And, what’s more, they play nicely with just about every product out there. I cannot say the same for the competition. We have a few of those devices as well. If you’re thinking about getting one of these, just do it! You won’t be disappointed. In a few weeks I’m sure I’ll hear my family members saying that they love the Echo 8s we got them for Christmas!!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2019"
247,Dougie Quick,Ad Machine,"  I really want to like this thing, it sounds great, looks great, works flawlessly for what I use it for. I use it every day, I have routines set up for music and lights, overall I like it, but there is one glaring flaw that everyone has pointed out already, the ads. Its not just the ""try this"" statements any more, those were annoying enough on their own, I saw a full screen add to watch anime on hulu on it yesterday! What the heck amazon, you make enough money off me without trying to shove ads on my bedside clock! I want a clock with alexa and a nice speaker built in, I don't need nor do I want to have a constant demo mode on my product with the ""try this"" statements, and I sure as hell do not want ads on it. And I also want a full screen clock option, instead of this crappy 1 inch clock on a freaking 8 inch screen! I'm keeping it only because it was a gift so I couldn't return it if i wanted to, but honestly with some basic programming and a $30 pi computer I could make a way better echo show, and thats probably what I'm gonna do.

248,LJ,Excellent for connecting with my 96 year-old father-in-law during the pandemic,"  I was looking for something that would allow family members to communicate with my 96 year-old father-in-law, especially during the pandemic.  The senior living facility where he stays had pretty much shut down once Covid-19 hit the States.  We could still talk with my father-in-law via cell phone, but due to his advanced age, it was getting harder and harder for him to remember how to correctly use a cell phone.  The senior living facility also allowed for Zoom calls, but we had to schedule those ahead of time.After doing some research, it seemed as though my options were pretty limited until I started looking more at the Amazon Show.  I was intrigued by their Drop In feature, which allows you to do a video call using the Show and a cell phone/tablet that has the Alexa app loaded onto it.  The nice thing about it is that the person who has the Show doesn't have to do a thing when they receive a call.  They just need to stand in front of the Show so that they can be seen.  The Show has a short time period (5 seconds or so) where the person originating the call is shown a fuzzy screen while the person with the Show hears a chime to let them know that someone is Dropping In.  This allows for the person to scoot out of the view of the Show if they are not presentable.I was a bit frustrated because there didn't seem to be much documentation on how to set up the Drop In feature.  I looked into e-books and scoured the internet for articles on exact steps for setting up the Drop In feature.  It all seemed pretty straight forward, but for some reason my setup didn't go that smoothly.  It took quite a few hours for me to figure out the settings I wanted on the Alexa app (ie: don't load all of my contacts from my phone onto my account) and how to add other family members to the Show setup so that they could Drop In on my father-in-law.  But, once everything was set up, it is working like a champ and multiple family members have  been able to clearly see and talk with my father-in-law using the Show.A few things to know about setting up the Drop In feature.  1)  You will need to connect the Show to a wireless network.  The facility that my father-in-law lives in has a wifi network.  My husband just happened to catch a window of opportunity where he could physically visit his dad one day this last June.  At that time, he set up the Show in my father-in-laws room (we used one of the wall mounts for the Show available on Amazon) and connected it to the wifi.  2)  We set our Show up so that each person who wants to Drop In on my father-in-law has the Amazon Alexa app downloaded onto their phone and is signed in with their own Amazon account.  3)  The Show is connected to my account, which I will call the Main Account.  You will need to go into whichever you designate as your Main Account, into the Communicate area for the Show that you have set up, and  allow permission for a given person (identified by their phone number) to Drop In onto the Show.Some family members were concerned about loading all of their phone contacts into the Alexa App.  Others were concerned about allowing the Alexa App to listen in for the 'Hey Alexa' key word.  Both of these features can be turned off in the user settings.We used the Show to Drop In on my father-in-law tonight.  It was comforting to see that he is still doing ok.  I felt much more connected with him than if I were talking on a phone.  This type of communication really came in handy when my father-in-law fell (during the pandemic when visitors aren't allowed) and the care facility staff were doing their assessment as to how he was doing.  During the assessment, my sister-in-law Dropped In and was able to see the staff in action.  The Drop In feature is definitely worth its weight in gold, especially when it comes to keeping tabs on the senior loved ones in our lives.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2020"
249,Mark Reeves and the Tech Truth,"Does not ""Work"" with REOLink Cameras, only ""Shows""","  The unit is slick, with a beautiful display, clear voice, and with mostly good voice recognition.  What I hate is you must use your phone through yet another App, and another Login, this time from Amazon, to intergrade this unit into your home WiFi network!?  I just don't get that.  You're agreeing to another set of 10-thousand unread statements of legalese designed to put you completely at fault (and at risk) for anything and everything that goes wrong, and giving away another set of usernames, passwords, and personal information just to have a stupid display.  It does not download anything pertaining to functionality, that has to come from the phone App.  And the worst for me was it is true to its name, it is an Echo ""Show"", so you can't use it to work with your cameras as you can your phone, which is why I bought it in the first place.  It will ""show"" you a camera's live image when you ""ask"" it to, or you can use the touch screen to scroll to the Home Security screen and select a camera to view, but that's all you get.  And it took me hours of searching to find out how to just do that!  If you are like me and have no access to cable or Fios or satellite Internet at your house, and all you have is a cell phone router, this machine will eat your limited data plan up!, and slow your router down!  It is sent with every option turned on, and no manual to help you get it set up like you would want.  You will need to hunt and scroll and peck through hundreds of touch screen lines, experiment with voice commands, and scour Internet sites to find the commands to try and get it to do your bidding.  All the while, it chews through hundreds of Megabytes from your data plan as it tells you, whether you wanted to know it or not, the latest receipts, the sports highlights, the weather in Haiti, and asks if you want to hear a joke before breakfast.  So lastly, the answer is No!, you cannot use this device to receive notifications or talk to visitors at your front door REOLink camera.  All you can do is look at them, should you just happen to notice someone is standing there by looking out the window in the first place.  Now that's real smart home convenience.If you are one of the lucky ones to have gotten this thing to work as advertised for REOlink cameras, then please post that setup for those who just don’t have the time, the patience, or the inclination to sit around their PC and hunt for clues on to how to set it up.

250,Laura,ANNOYING with non-stop 'Alexa for your Day' suggestions that can't be turned off.,"  This was a gift. I've had it for close to a year and a half and for the 2 months or so it has become useless to me for what it was sent to me for. It was gifted to me to have the ability to do drop in video calls with family overseas, but now in order to not have it completely unplugged due to the reoccurring flashing notifications of ""Alexa for your Day"" which can not be disabled I had to set it on do not disturb because the only other option was to unplug it permanently. I might as well unplug it for how useless it is since it's no longer useable for why it was gifted to me and non of the other features are any good anymore (see below). No more calls dropping in AT ALL. I keep hoping they will fix it, but NOPE. Since I got it I've had it in my bedroom in view from my bed, which makes the ""Alexa for your Day"" flashing screen the most disturbing thing you can imagine. Watching TV, guess what would catch my eye? Talking on the phone? Distraction in your face! Trying to sleep? HAHAHAHA.Other annoying habits of Alexa since I received this:> I can't say anything to it without it giving me a whole paragraph on some feature it wants me to use.> I can't play music on it most of the time unless I want to spend money monthly for music unlimited.  When I first got echo devices they played all the music I wanted as much as I wanted at no additional charge.> It is very slow to respond with video when my ring device goes off. I've given up on it and just use my phone at this point.> When it does decide to play music it used to show the lyrics so you could sing along, which was awesome. Now it does this for only about half the song before it just goes back to the home screen. No matter how much I tell it to show the lyrics, it keeps reverting to home. I can't even get through one song anymore.WHY IS ALL OF THIS EXTRA SUPER DUPER ANNOYING? BECAUSE MY OVERSEAS FAMILY GETS ALL THESE FEATURES INCLUDED WITH THEIR ALEXA + NETFLIX AND DISNEY PLUS AT NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE AND WITHOUT THE CONSTANT ADVERTISING. THIS IS SPECIAL PRICE HIKING/ANNOYING INTRUSIVE ADVERTISING FOR USA CUSTOMERS.Yes, I have disabled everything is allows me to disable from the settings on both the device and on my phone's alexa app. This is not a user issue. This is a Amazon wants to control your very soul and take all your money issue.Don't waste your money on this product, there are way better options out there that won't turn into useless piece of junk in your house.

251,B. Fast,Another Alexa Device,"  I wanted to add another device to my house so I upgraded with the Echo Show 8 to replace my 1st generation Echo Show. I moved my older show to the other spot in my house that I wanted to have a device with it's capabilities. The first thing I found is was a bit hard to get my Hue lights connected to the new device. Actually it might have been too easy which caused issues. I have had to delete my original lights twice to get them to work correctly. I had things set up for zones and it kept adding the lights over and over as new devices. I think I finally got it to work as I had it with the old Echo Show. Only time will tell. The second thing I noticed is that after so many people have stated their dislike for the ""Try This"" feature on the home screen that Amazon has still ignored the request to turn it off if you don't want or need it to be there. We need a switch in the settings somewhere on the Display tab to get rid of this if you don't want it there. Some people say there is a way to do it but trying each of their methods has been fruitless. It doesn't turn off. I'm thinking the ones who stated they contacted Amazon help and were told it can't be done are correct. Third thing I found a bit annoying is the power connection at the device. It's fine that you now have a connector plug instead of it being hard wired but it would have been just a touch more convenient to have a 90 degree plug instead of the straight plug. It sticks out a bit far past the body of the device and with the back end being longer already to accommodate the speakers it is a little deep and gets in the way.Overall the device seems to be a good upgrade. There must be a new processor which is speedier than the previous one because many things get done a lot faster than before. One thing I noticed is about four times faster is turning off the screen when I go to bed. The old one seemed to linger for three or four seconds but the new one goes off almost instantly. I think many other things are speedier as well. The Echo Show 8 is a good intermediate size, not too small and not too big. In fact it's new configuration gives me another inch of screen size in a body that is smaller in height and just a touch bigger in depth than the original.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2020"
252,B. Kolean,Should be a solid 4.5 rating,"  Bought this item on sale because I read some of the reviews and it sounded like a solid buy for a travel entertainment system.  First. Let me say I would buy this again, but it cannot achieve better than 3 stars as-is.  If there are future firmware updates that allow for better functionality, then I will revisit this review.Pros:1. Very gooD HD display.  Any of the shows I’ve watched have been crystal clear.  Same for the menu interfaces.2. Touchscreen is responsive and works well with very few sluggishness.3.  The sound is incredibly good compared to any of the Echo products that came before it.  In fact, I would compare the quality to Bose products.  It’s not as good as Bose, but it approaches it and it’s noticeable.  The bass reproduction is great!  Explains the weight of the product.4.  Simple to use.  Minimal buttons and gadgets without sacrificing user interface.  The touchscreen helps a lot in that regard.  The manual slide switch to cover the camera lens is a good example; simple and 100% effective.5.  The home screen is fully configurable.6.  Aesthetics allow it to fit into almost any decor without standing out.Cons:1. This is the other edge of the sword for sound quality: it’s weighty for its size.  I wouldn’t hog it for any portion of a star for this, however, because the trade-off is worth it.  Just worth mentioning if you’re going to use it as a portable entertainment center.2.  Without a separate stand, the viewing angle is fixed.3.  Here is the biggie and what cost this otherwise fantastic product one and a half stars: lack of app functionality.  The only video apps with which it interfaces are Prime Video (of course), Hulu, and YouTube (va FireFox).  The big streamer apps (NetFlix, HBO Max, STARZ, etc.) are absent and cannot be downloaded.  Further, while you can get to Google and FireFox browsers, going to the site and logging in doesn’t help.  Always prompts to download the app.  I don’t know if this is a limitation of the hardware and resident OS, streaming rights or competitor issues...or a combination of all.  I am inclined to believe it isn’t hardware or software related.  Fix this, and the rating is a solid 4.5.4.  Lack of a travel case makes this product vulnerable to damage when traveling.

253,Amazon Customer,Not at all what I was hoping for,"  I purchased this for two reasons: a convenient way to display recipes that didn't require my phone being out, and streaming movies for when I'm in the kitchen for hours at a time.I rely heavily on streaming during the holiday seasons while I bake to fulfill orders, and while the video quality was good, and the sound was AMAZING, the rest of the device was too troublesome to be worth it.Example: Open amazon video, and it gives you 4 categories to go through, or your library. I go to my library (severe lag every single time) and I find the movie I want. I hit play, severe lag again, and it plays. Quality is not bad at all, especially for the price, but heaven forbid you have to pause. Once you pause for ~2-3 minutes, it goes to a screen saver. And when you unlock it, you have to go through the process of finding the movie all over again. It's a pain in the butt. They could at least have a ""continue watching..."" at the beginning of the prime menu, but it doesn't.Secondly, our household has 3 users on our hulu account--if there was a way to switch users through the Echo, I didn't see it. I googled it, thinking I was overlooking it, and nothing. We all have very different tastes for shows/movies, and never use each others accounts for this reason. To have not one, but two streaming services being out of the question/too inconvenient to use, I couldn't handle it.The integration was wonky at best. I have an echo dot that resides on a window sill about 3 feet from where I had my echo. My echo was off for voice recognition, but when I'd talk to my dot, it would display on my echo. This was cool except for two things: 1. It did it intermittently. 1 out of 3 times it would mirror to the echo. 2. if you were streaming something when the echo mirrored what the dot was telling you, guess what, YOU HAVE TO FIND THE MOVIE AGAIN. It was a nightmare.Maybe down the road they'll figure out a more user friendly programming for this, but until then I'm returning it. It was meant to be a gift for family, but if I, an electronic savvy 30-something, can't figure it out, I wouldn't be comfortable giving it to my grandparents, which was the end goal.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2020"

It had stories that it offered to play--in Spanish--but couldn't play them.  I called and talked to somehow in December-shortly after getting the device and he said that feature wasn't available yet, so I was patient until last week--the middle of February--when I called again.  This person discovered that not only could it not play the stories in Spanish, but she had me change it to English and it couldn't do it in English either.  She said she'd call me back in a day or two with a solution.  A week later I realized that there hadn't been a call and probably never would be, so I called back and this time, Lance offered to send me a new device, which he did. In the meantime, after Janelle had had me update my current device, not only did it not play the videos, it took away one of my favorite features ""Explicame also en cincuenta segundos"" which is tell me something in 50 seconds.  My new device came today and it plays the stories from the screen (videos)--reluctantly-I have to touch the screen because it won't play it first time around from a voice command, even though it says it will, but it's an improvement. It still won't respond to ""Expicame also en cincuenta segundos.""  Is there any way of getting that back?  Also, they sent me a refurbished unit.  I don't feel well taken care of by Amazon Customer Service in some ways--especially considering that I've spent almost exactly five hours on the phone regarding this--much of it on hold. listening to the same, repetitive song over and over again and having to hear over and over again how important my call is. Why repeat that over and over?  I got it the first time and don't need to hear it again.  Also, isn't Amazon able to come up with a little more variety of music?--or offer ""no music"" the way Apple does?March 1st—I’m going to change to 5 ⭐️ if possible because now the device does play the advertised stories on the screen upon request and though it still no longer has the “ Explicame Algo....” feature, it has added new features to ask.

There are many great features, I love asking Alexa to make  a grocery list that I can open in the store.  Enjoy music, news, cooking and more with Alexa in my kitchen. The problem is the speakers and sound quality.  IT SUCKS!  My Show  went from being good sound to intermittent on off as if I was driving through a dead zone even though it’s stationary in my kitchen.  When I called Amazon they walked me through a reset which seemed to fix the problem.  A short time later the same issues occurred with the show and it began sounding like a transistor radio or tin can.  I called customer service again and they walked me through a reset.  This time the Show still sounded bad.  I asked for an exchange and they agreed to send a new one to me.  When my “new” Show arrived it was actually a reconditioned unit.  To me this was not at all acceptable.  I called customer service again and the representative told me this was the policy, that after so many days you are given a reconditioned until during your year warranty.  After my challenging this and being on hold he agreed to refund my money, but not all of it since I had used the product.  After challenging this and being on hold even longer he agreed to refund my full purchase price but not to replace my show with a new model.  I did not buy a reconditioned unit, I bought a brand new one and do not think that it is fair to replace it with a reconditioned unit.  I will never buy another Amazon electronic device and suggest you consider the same.  A warranty means a new replacement only if used in the first few months, after that it means you will get a reconditioned unit or a partial refund since you used the item.  I wanted to replace an item that I loved and used daily but Amazon let me down and would not do what I feel is the right thing.  Amazon is a huge company and surely could replace a faulty product with a new one.  If you read the reviews you will see that the speakers are a consistent problem with other customers as well.  Even the tech places reviews agree the speakers stink.  Wish I had known this before I purchased my Show.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 24, 2021"
257,Cliente de Kindle,1st Gen Voice recognition = Horrible,"  After years of using the regular Echo's from the cylinders to the pucks, was excited to try the video version.Am surprised that the voice recognition has not gotten better. Repeatedly having to say the Alexa wake word is getting old.Compared to the non-video Echo's, this is a clear step back for voice assistants, no matter the location this Show 8 doesn't hear the Alexa summons  ⅓ of the time when being queried.You literally have to stand next to it for your success rate to be closer to 67% or if the room is in total silence.Else, the video integration with the Ring cams is pretty smooth & entertainment content is always readily available.But disappointing that almost 10 years after  the initial Echo was introduced, the Show 8 can't do the simple ask & answer task.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2021"
258,DLM,Doesn’t always work.,"  My 8 is amazing, except the multi commands option doesn’t work. Turn the alarm off and pause the music for example. She doesn’t understand. You just have to going through the new commands each time. Also, we play games with her like ticket to ride, and she NEVER understands us! It’s like a running joke in our house. We literally have had to tell her our moves 15+ times and in some cases it just shuts the game off!! This is horribly frustrating but a cool idea if they ever work the bugs out. Also we don’t have accents, and speak loud and clearly. Oh and if it sends suggestion lists to the app, I don’t get them. I have looked and looked.. very frustrating. And the way it saves recipes is not easy to find. And it boots you out of them, and does not do things like “read step 2 again. She can only read all the steps over again! Dumb. Dumb.

259,Heather,It's a great device but we expected more at this stage,"  We had purchased the original echo for our parents and at the time, it felt adequate for them especially since we only needed it to do a few simple things (light control, music) so we never dug deeper. When the Echo 8 went on sale we took advantage and dove into the world of Alexa (and integrated it with a Ring doorbell). Over the last month we have played a lot with it and the overall feeling is its just ok and Amazon is leaving a lot of very simple features on the floor. The integration with other devices was easyish but cumbersome and felt clumsy.  The worst part is that since we include our parents on out Prime account, their echo is getting a lot of notices and shared set ups as ours. Some I could turn off (i.e. they no longer get the message if someone is at our door) but not all so if we order a package, when it's delivered, they get a notice when we do so it creates some confusion.The Echo 8 has a screen but the Apps available are essentially limited to a handful of video (Netflix, Prime Video) but I understand they are going to remove YouTube since they are losing their agreement with Google. Another limitation is the device is very heavily dependent on my synched phone app. I felt it should be more independent or at least make better use of the screen. Once thing I know for sure is I'm glad we didn't get the Echo 10. The added cost would have been silly when the system still needs so much work and development.Overall, it's a fun toy for the house and I am sure we will discover some fun things it can do but I wish it was simpler and more intuitive than it is. I wish Amazon could coordinate with Apple and Google better vs the rivalry that is essentially making their systems worse. And I wish there was a better interface than the App on my phone because there are far too many things I need to learn (i.e. skills programing) to make it work better and who has time to learn how to do that?",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 15, 2021"
260,UrAverageReviewer,Alexa integration a complete and total FAIL,"  I was an early adopter of Amazon's smart speakers and am by no means a hater - my review of the Echo glasses remains the top positive review on Amazon's site.  But my frustration with the integration failures of the Echo devices I own - Echo Show 8, Echo Show 5, Echo Spot, and Echo Dot (in addition to my glasses) - has reached the boiling point.  The problem is this: I will issue a command to one device, only to have another of my devices carry it out.  For example, this morning, I asked the Echo Show 8 in my kitchen to play NPR.  Nothing happened.  Instead, the Echo Dot in my wife's office - on another floor of the house, and which has a different wake word - played NPR and would NOT respond to my wife's repeated commands asking it to stop.  Nor would it respond to the commands I issued to the Echo Show 8 in the kitchen.  We ended up having to unplug both devices to get them to shut up.This was not just annoying; it disrupted a work meeting at the most inopportune time.I wish this was a one-off.  I have, however, contacted Amazon about this problem on at least three separate occasions.  On the first two occasions, they had me call their help desk, which had me do the obvious things that I had already done and which were completely ineffective.  Worse, the help people were clearly reading a script without much understanding of what they were saying.  On the third occasion - and after I had noted the failure of the two previous occasions - they simply ignored my request for assistance.In addition to the disruption and annoyance this problem presents, it poses real privacy concerns.  How are these devices communicating with each other if a command issued to one gets carried out by another?I have already begun migrating to Google Home.  It will be my smart speaker of choice going forward.Update (09/12/21): I asked the device in my kid's room to read him a story, only to have the story read aloud from a device in another part of the house entirely.

262,Anthoney Baker,"It’s good, but really needs a better mic array","  We have several Echo and Echo Dot products in the house, and are overall pleased with them.  I decided to add a Show to the kitchen.  Overall I’m glad I did, but there are pros and cons.  Since this thing has been reviewed a zillion times over, I’ll keep this list tidy:Pros:- Great display.  Clear and bright.- Handy for recipes- Handy for weather forecasts- I LOVE that the camera cover is actually a piece of plastic.  I can trust that the camera is actually off.- The Home Screen is interesting.  I see stocks, headlines and recipes fly by and there is some degree of customization that can be done- The music lyrics feature is just awesome, especially in a house with a young reader.  This alone makes me love this device more than I thought I would- “Show me the front door” (Ring camera) is very handy and way more responsive than the Ring app on my phone.Cons:- The microphone performance is just sub-par when compared with the Echo or even Echo Dot.  This is the only reason I don’t own a second one of these for a different room, and the only reason why I can’t give it 5-stars.  I have it in the exact same spot as where our Echo was and the mic performance is bordering on awful.  We have tried many different locations in the same room, with no success.  We have blown dust out of the mic holes, gently, with only slight improvement.  Conclusion after messing around with it?  The mic array is lacking compared to its Echo peers.- I have to touch the screen to interact with someone on Ring?  Am I missing something?  I want to tell the solicitors to go pound sand without leaving the couch! :)My take: Overall this is a great device, and I’m glad I own it.  That being said, I won’t be buying another (or shipping one to Mom) until I see an update with better microphone performance.  I’m looming forward to the next generation of this.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 26, 2021"
263,Liz C,MOSTLY fabulous...,"  I really do love this device, but it has a couple of major flaws that really lower the quality of my user experience.1) You absolutely cannot turn off ""Things to Try,"" which scrolls across the bottom of the screen at random. It gets to be REALLY IRRITATING. Especially when it's telling me useless, nonsensical garbage like ""Tell Alexa ET phone home!"" It's neither cute nor amusing when I don't have the option to turn it off. They APPEAR to have this option in the app, but it's either for a very specific type of notification (not the RIGHT one) or it simply doesn't work. As customizable as these are supposed to be, I REALLY don't appreciate not being allowed to choose whether I have their ""suggestions"" scrolling across the bottom of my photo frame! Also, people have been complaining about this same issue for YEARS - I saw that online as I spent HOURS searching in vain for a solution - and Amazon has completely and repeatedly ignored customers about this issue.2) The sound has a major flaw. While the sound quality itself is good, whenever I'm using any kind of media, like when I'm watching a show on Prime video, I have to turn the volume up in order to be able to hear the voices properly. But when I do that, Alexa SHOUTS at me so loudly it wakes up my entire house. And even in whisper mode she's not that great at distinguishing whispers from normal speaking volume. They ABSOLUTELY NEED a setting for Alexa's voice volume that's INDEPENDENT of the media volume. And the music in the show is often extremely loud compared to the voices, even after adjusting the settings. It's been so bad that  I have had to adjust the volume seven or eight times in the course of a single one-hour episode of a television show.Don't get me wrong, so far, aside from these two major annoyances, I absolutely love my echo show. For example, I got some smart plugs and love so much that I can set my lights with timers so I can be sure that my dog isn't in the dark when I'm at work without having to have the lights on the entire day. I love that it now supports zoom and Netflix, although I hope they get it for all echo shows soon and not just the 8. I love being able to watch things on it from my bed instead of on my phone, and I can set a sleep timer. There are so many things that are just awesome, and I have no regrets about upgrading from my dot.

266,Todd,Bought it at Christmas but not using it,"  When I got this it was cool.  I could play some music.  It has a good speaker.  If I could find music I liked that would be great.  I even paid the 3.99 for extra music...and still limited selection. I just canceled that 3.99 subscription. It's a great timer, though.  ""Alexa, time me 3 minutes.""  It works fine for that.  To me, that's about it.  I could have just gotten the dot for that. Expensive timer.  Usually, I turn off the microphone due to worries on privacy issues. If I do want to use it I have to go turn on the mike.Great sound.  Limited selection on music.  It can display my pictures but does a horrible job on it.  I added at least 50 pictures to it and it displayed maybe 20. Once, I saw it sit on the same picture for at least 4 minutes. So, it is is not even a good picture display device.  When it does display pictures, it throws in ads and other crap in the middle of the display.  Often, it quits displaying my pictures and goes to news or ads.  I just want to see pictures.

267,TinkerGuy,It's a no for me and I'll explain why,  I'd like to say that first the sound quality and voice detection is pretty amazing on this even when it's going pretty loud it can detect you unlike some of the older models.The functionality is pretty bad though you would think that this would be able to let you watch more videos and stuff on it but they are really hating on their competitors with this as per usual.There are certain video platforms they have blocked from allowing you to use on this device and it's pretty Petty and obvious why they're doing it.I would say there's hope for it if they come up with an update but I would not recommend buying one of these right now until they stop hating on other video companies and competitors.Amazon keeps trying really hard to be its own thing and I appreciate it as a shopping service but I think they should stop trying to be their own entity because it's just annoying for me personally as the customer.almost all of their devices run on some sort of form of Android's operating system but it's pretty obvious they don't want you using the Google play store or anything.It's a no from me I won't return it I don't hate it that much but it's definitely a no.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2021"
268,TinkerGuy,Definately DON'T recommend ...,"  I have a large house, which is old. So I decided to retrofit it and make it smarter. So, I have heavily invested into Amazon Alexa gadgets, including two of Echo Show 8, multiple Echo Dots and Echo speakers of various generations, as well as Ring Alarm and Ring Doorbell.The overall impression of the Alexa ecosystem for me is negative (2/10).Because, Echoshow 8 is an integral part of the whole system, it gets affected by it, as well as having its own serious shortcomings.1. Speech recognition is way subpar to what Google offers. Not understanding questions, not having answers overall slows down this things it should  be able to handle.2. Way too slow to connect to another Echoshow with ""drop in"" command, with annoying confirmation requests, which relies on speech recognition as well. This makes it slower yet.3. Inability to have most popular apps installed. I mean things that are SO common, such as YouTube and Netflix. You have a beautiful screen with a good speaker, but you are being FORCED away from some most favorite and common video content providers. Lately Amazon ALLOWED to play YouTube from their browser. Which is obviously not the same experience. Netflix, however, is completely UNAVAILABLE.4. Advertising on my screen!!! That's the craziest and most annoying part. I tried multiple times going through the settings, trying to remove everything from the screen,. Nothing works! They still advertise to ME on MY device, using MY electric energy, without my consent. I even tell Alexa to turn off the screen. It turns it off for a little while, then turns On a little while later, without any prompts.5. Lately I receive messages that ""I might be running low"" on certain supplies, I usually buy from Amazon. WTH? That's crossing lines too. Unprompted. I feel like Amazon invades my privacy.6. Frequent unprompted suggestions to: ""Try new things with Alexa""... New dumb ""games"" or tricks to use Alexa. These are impossible to remove as well. And they stay on the screen for a long time, ruining a beautiful wallpaper you might have on the screen otherwise.7. Inability to play external video files - no hardware support (SD or MicroSD card readers) or wireless capability.8. Overall poorly designed UI, with VERY few limited choices.=========Conclusion:I attached several photos of Echo 8 , taken within approximately one minute. The amount of cycling unprompted ads and ""suggestions"" makes me wish I could return all of them. But, I cant , so this review is for those of you who think of getting ANY Alexa device.For those of you thinking that Amazon will have it fixed. I went through many forums, trying find my way around these issues. People have been complaining about these same issues for YEARS! Amazon doesnt listen and doesnt care.

271,DaytonaDan,Well worth the purchase and has excellent video and audio quality!,"  I bought this on prime day with the blink mini camera and absolutely love it. I will be replacing a couple of my Echo audio devices with the Echo Show 8. I use this one in my home office as I work from home. I have two blink mini cameras and it allows me to keep an eye on my dogs and my 14 year olds soon, who is doing remote schooling right now. I also ordered a blink outdoor 5 cameras system I am looking forward to using with this.The video display is excellent. I often listen to you tube podcasts during my work day and the quality is excellent. I have my Amazon prime photos displaying on it when it's otherwise not in use, and they look amazing, and it's super easy to see my blink mini cameras on it and the camera quality is also excellent. I will also be adding a ring doorbell to the system as well which hopefully will sync just as well as the blink cameras do.The audio on the echo show 8 is really good as well. It's a bit bassey but it sits directly on my oak desktop and I am not using the stand, which would elevate it a bit and probably help with that. I also have Amazon music HD and it sounds great on the echo show. Honestly it sounds better than on my 2nd gen echo device and it's plenty loud.One if the handy features I like is the privacy button directly on it. I can close the video camera shutter by sliding it over, and as I have no need for it right now it's always closed. And I can shut off the microphone sensor with the press of a button on the top. It shows a red bar on the bottom of the screen to signify that the mic sensor is muted.I have not used the built-in video camera yet, as I don't know anyone else who has an echo show to call, so really can't comment on that. I'll try it out when I order another echo show 8.I highly recommend this.

275,Lorraine,Very mixed feelings...,"  After purchasing to Echo Show5s last year, we opted to buy several more this year. Unfortunately, I had not used the previous ones (one was my mothers and one my sons) and knowing what i know now, I'm n ot sure I'd have gone this route again. We have 2 Show 8s and 4 Show 5s at this point. I can recall reading reviews and seeing that people were angry about the ""discoveries"" and Alexa tips that roll through the device -it seemed like they were really making a big deal out of nothing. but after using them more frequently myself....they are SUPREMELY annoying. I had intended to utilize photos as the background, thinking that even if the discoveries and tips ran across the bottom, it would be fine. But that's not how to works. I've set the background to photos that cycle through, but after each photo the top/discovery screen comes back. It feels cheap and tacky as a result, its almost like having constant commericials...and looks cheap and tacky too. I had expected to have soemthing similar to a digital photo frame when the device was at rest, and that does not work and I hate it. I cant believe there isn't a way to change that.Additionally, when you have several of these, you can't really set ""profiles"", so everybody's ""recent activities"" shows up on every device, which, again...supremely annoying. In each room of the house, it suggests that we watch/listen to the things my toddler watched and while it doesn't impact life, it's irritating.Photos are another issue. If you link this to Amazon photos in order to utilize pictures as a background, everybody will have access to all of your photos just by saying ""show me my photos"". You CAN make folders of photos and set the individual Shows to use one folder or another, but there is no way to disable access to ALL photos.It's really unfortunate that they have not offered a solution to the ""tops and discoveries"". It's terrible. And it really unfortunate that they have no offered a way to create a user profile or something for each deviceON the positive note, the speakers are good.

I use this in our master bedroom for typical Alexa stuff (controlling lights/lamps in our room, playing music, weather checks, “show me the front door” with Ring doorbell, news updates, so on). I can confirm the speaker and sound from Echo Show 8 is better in absolutely every way compared to first gen. This is obviously expected as Amazon has upped their game in audio. I have the second gen Echo Show in our kitchen and love these two Echo Shows. I think back to 2014 when I first got my hands on the original Echo. This whole ecosystem has evolved so well for the most part (they do have some duds in the line-up). If you’re considering the Echo Show 5 versus the 8, I would recommend the 8. It’s not going to take up nearly as much room as the Echo Show, and the difference in sound quality and extra few inches of screen versus the 5 is obvious. It’s a good in-between option and I’m thrilled Amazon launched this version.

I am even listening to my Kindles on my Echo Show, instead of reading them. There is no text on the screen so I can sit back with eyes closed and sip on my scotch relaxing. Yes, you can do this on the Kindle too, but the sound is better and I believe more natural too. When I switch my “reading” from the Echo Show to my Kindle, or vice versa, the other product picks up the story where the other ended. It even goes back a page to help you remember the story during the pause in reading. The Echo Show even has the lyrics to some of the songs scrolling down the screen when the music is played. Simple commands like, “Alexa, what are my orders” show me the products I ordered in vivid color. I can keep on forever, but now the problem.It doesn’t work very well with my Ring door bell. I am certain I have it properly linked with the Echo show. My Alexa app on my cell phone shows it is linked, but I can’t get it to announce, “There is motion at your front door.” Nothing happens if someone rings the door or is outside. I only hear this on my other Echos and my cell phone. I can say, “Alexa, show me my front door and it will 75 % of the time show me a live view of the door and the person outside, but there is a lag and often the person is gone or is out of view. When I ask what the weather is, it will also display graphs of forthcoming temperature as well as indicators of wind, rain, etc. Much more comfortable have the sense of sight as well as hearing to grasp all this information. I feel I can live with this problem of not announcing motion at my front door. I still have my other gadgets doing this.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2020"
278,Robert G. Norris,Wonderful for communicating with family!,  I bought 2 of these when my relative was in the hospital.  Due to COVID we were unable to see her.  I had the nurse install one in her room- (I set it up previous to delivering the the hospital).  I enabled Drop in anytime on both devices.  And I was able to drop in and communicate with her anytime!  It was wonderful to be able to talk with her and encourage her.  I am so thankful for this device and I will forever be grateful for the time we were able to see each other!  Sadly we lost our loved one.  But we are thankful for the time that we had!

280,Kayla,Not very impressed.,"  I have the echo show 5 and liked it well, except for the tiny screen and placement of the speaker (on the bottom so its muffled all the time???) So I figured the 8 was alot bigger screen and would have new and better features.  It's just kind of a bigger screen is all. It's really heavy, so using the ""outlet shelves"" they make for these would end up snapping the cheap plastic they are made from. It was just....disappointing I guess and I'm a huge ECHO everything and smart home owner slowly in the making anyways. It definitely integrates with the smart plugs, lights and other well as I can see so far. Even did great integration with my new Roombas robot vacuum I got over xmas. I don't know, if I were someone who was looking at this, I'd wait for the newer one or one after cause the 5 (liked but NEVER completely worked right)and the 8 is nothing spectacular  just costs more. I'll be trading mine 5 and 8 for something new, not sure if I'm going to stick with the Alexa echos or jump to Google or apple.

282,Michael P. Thompson,Great Product - One of Amazon's best in my opinion,"  This is my second Echo Show I had previously purchased a 1st GEN Echo Show for my home office. It did run into a screen pixelation issue about 10 or 11 months after purchasing, but Amazon repaired it free of charge and it has been going strong ever since.So when I saw the newest generation of the 8 inch echo show on sale I decided to give it a try. So far it has been great. I was able to set it up in under 1 minute. I really like the way the screen goes completely dark when you turn out the lights. Besides all the capabilities you would expect from an Echo, you also have the ability to display your photos, watch videos and movies, monitor & check home security cameras (e.g., RING, Arlo, Blink are ones I can confirm), check on loved ones, etc.I personally think the Echo Show 8 makes is a great bedroom companion, not so much for its ability to watch movies and TV, but it's great for checking security devices, time and weather, listening to music, a book or a podcast or other non-intrusive activities while lying in bed, getting ready for bed or getting up for the day. The 8 inch size is not too big nor too small for the bedroom. You can use this in conjunction with cameras to easily monitor your small or sick children (or parent or other loved ones) during the night wherever they might be. I find it great and easy to use to checkin and communicate with my aging parents.Both the video and sound quality are surprisingly good. While not videophile or audiophile quality, it’s extremely good and surprising for a compact device and price point.As for the size, the 8 inch screen works great for me. I am not sure that I would use it as a replacement for a larger screen TV. However, for what it does and for those spots where you want video capability without the size and potential headaches associated with placing a TV or larger monitoring device this is the way to go,So far, I am very happy with my purchase and highly recommend. It frequently goes on sale since Amazon wants to be the dominate smart home assistant provider, so buy one then if you think the Show 8 meets your needs and wants.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2020"
283,Koreame,I really like the 8 inch Show...,"  It fits perfectly where I wanted it to sit. I've been using echos since the 1st one. Not to mention, kindles (1st gen & newer), paperwhites (1st gen & newer) kindle fires (1st gen & ...), fire HD's (yeah, etc), sticks, TV's, echo dots, auto & buds. So, not much of a change or anything new for me. I keep buying them, along with, light bulbs, switches, whatever. I would take that as a positive endorsement. But, with this echo, I can watch twitch on it, while gaming, with just my voice. Unlike, my 1st gen echo that has been in here since I bought it. You know, no screen. I didn't get the 5 inch, my Razer phone is bigger & better in every way over that one. Yes, Razer, not a motorola razr. 5.72-inch, 120Hz screen at 2560 x 1440, dual front facing speakers with individual amplifiers & Dolby Atmos. The 10 may have been OK.

I figured out how to turn those off and we were good to go again... until a ""feature"" called ""Alexa for your day"" was introduced, which cannot be disabled. I was willing to tolerate that popping up every once in a while, though it is irritating. Then Alexa started giving me suggestions every time I told her to do something (Ask for the weather and get a ""by the way, did you know that you can ask what events are happening  near you?"" after she reads off the weather). That was when I started to get pretty angry. Now the device is outright showing advertisements on the home screen. The device is going bye bye and I'm never buying another Amazon device.

285,Paneks_18,Good but with short comings,"  June 2020 – I have had my Echo Show 8 for around a week now.  Overall I am pleased with it. The screen is clear and sharp and the speakers are solid with no distortion. It is easy to set up and use especially if you already have an Echo device.Positives:Picture Frame – clear and easy to use.  The source is your Amazon Photos and it is extremely easy to change the albums you want to view.Lists – your various lists are shown nicely whether it be your shopping list and your to-dos. I have a number of lists I set up and it nice to be able to see them.Calendar – again shows nicely on the screen and you have the ability to scroll down or pick out a specific date with a voice command.Music – works nicely with Sirius XM and Amazon Music ( the latter giving the extra bonus of seeing the lyrics.}Video Calls – I tested it and it works but with so many other options I don’t think I will be using this feature very much.Video Streaming – here again, I tested it and it works very well with Prime Video but again I don’t believe I will be using it to watch shows.Negatives:Personal Videos – If you have taken a video of a child’s concert or school play and stored it on Amazon Photos, it will show the video but not include the audio.  To me, this is a major short coming and disappointment. There is a work around by opening Google “ Open Google” and going to your Amazon Photo account but this is awkward and time consuming.  You should be able to ask Echo to show you the specific album and watch and listen to the video.Customized Q&As on Amazon Blueprint will not show on the screen. They will be read like any other Echo Device but not shown. This, too, is a disappointment.Recipes – I have not found any echo skill which can accommodate these.  I was hoping the Customized Q&As could but not useful without seeing it on the screen.Recap – Pleased with the Show but it fell short of my expectations as mentioned in the negatives. Therefore, could not give it a 5 rating but still pleased with it …. So I gave it a 4.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2020"
286,Luis and Traci,Great device with one major flaw,"  This is a great addition to your smart home, or just a stand alone speaker. You can stream Prime video over this as well as music. The default music is Amazon, however you can ask to play music from Other sources, such as Pandora. I have not streamed video from other sources besides Prime, and am not sure if that is an option. Video quality is good and sound quality is better than the Echo dot sound quality. The Bass is a little heavy, with no clearly available adjustments.This is a great device and the biggest problem is the angle at which it sits. It appears to be designed to sit on a counter top heigh with you looking down at it from a standing position, this is a huge drawback as mine is actually sitting on a microwave so it is about 14 inches above the counter. It would be higher than that, on a shelf at eye level if the base were at all adjustable, where it could display recipes while cooking. Directly on the counter flour and other ingredients could be very problematic, the designers of this product obviously did not consider real world applications when designing the base unit, which is sad considering that they made it capable of so much when designing the software, and I feel that an acceptable mount should com with this.Overall I recommend the echo show as a great smart home device, but due to the base, if you intend to use this while seated, buy an adjustable mount as well.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 15, 2021"

The video portion is a nice bonus.  I know many others have voice displeasure with the re-occurring Alexa suggestions running along the bottom of the screen.  I would rather not have them, but they don't bother me that much.  I don't use the Show for viewing any cameras.  I like having the news stories show up on the screen.  I've used it quite a bit to stream HULU which has been working well.  I also like the fact that acts as a digital picture frame.

288,John Thomas Smith,Works great with the Ring doorbell,"  We've had a Ring doorbell for many years now. We started with the standard Ring doorbell and then upgraded to two of the Ring Doorbell Pros. The main drawback to using the Ring to answer your door is having a phone or tablet available and then opening the Ring app to be able to answer the door. This turned out to be inconvenient, so we rarely used this feature. Now that Amazon has purchased Ring and made the Echo Show work seamlessly with the Ring, the situation has changed for the better. Since we've purchased a Show 8, a person ringing our Doorbell Pro will now be spontaneously displayed on the Show. My only complaint is that the image shows for only about 15 seconds before reverting back to the background display. It would be nice if this stayed on longer (like 30 or 60 seconds). Of course it's relatively easy to ask Alexa to show the front door, which will bring the image back up (and keep it up indefinitely).  Basically, if you use a Ring doorbell, you need an Echo Show to make the system work well for answering the door when at home, and it does work well.UPDATE 12/5/20: Using the Alexa app, I was able to write routines to make the Echo Show 8 even more versatile. If the Ring camera detects any motion, I have the Show 8 announce the camera detecting motion and then show about 60 seconds worth of live video feed from that camera. This all happens automatically, so I can glance over to the Show 8 to see if anyone is there (most often it's a passing squirrel). I also have a routine that turns on my front porch light (via a TP-Link Kasa smart switch) for a few minutes if the front door camera detects any motion while it's dark out. This helps me clearly see who is there when the Show 8 automatically shows that camera feed. This home automation thing is pretty nifty.Otherwise, I find the Echo Show 8 to be a very nice device. The music sound quality is fantastic, better than our other Echos. The image quality on the screen is also great. We use the Show as a digital picture frame with it playing our Amazon photos. These pictures look nicer than photos shown on our Google Home Hub, which sits next to the Show 8 (although the Home Hub is definitely satisfactory in this regard). We still haven't tried out all the other things that the Show 8 can do. Maybe some day :-)",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2020"

My son calls is a small tv bc it seems so much bigger then the 5! You get use to it quick bc I love all the things we can see and do. Of course you can do all the same things as the smaller one but since we are older I like this more. We are keeping our 5 too bc we can use that in another room.The screen quality is great and the sound is too. It’s durable and looks great. I wish it was a little slimmer but i understand it is needed to sit properly. My daughter said the picture looks great and you can definitely see more on the screen. We are now buying one for each of our kids so we can do group chats.I recommend this if you will use the screen for reading recipes, group chats, have a hard time reading small print,  or watching movies. But really you can’t go wrong with any of these. I do recommend researching stands bc we needed one to lift it off of the table more.

291,Cindo,Instantly bought another.,"  It all started with an Echo Dot and spiraled out of control from there. I got my first echo dot years ago to control a couple of smart outlets and really enjoyed the convenience. Then a while later got a deal on some smart bulbs with a second, newer Echo Dot, and enjoyed the smart home experience even more. The Echo Show was purchased to compliment a Ring Doorbell, and once they arrived there was truly no turning back. The whole suite of products was so easy to set up, immediately worked seamlessly and integrated itself into my existing smart home setup. The sound on the Echo Dots was fine for a small smart speaker, but the sounds on the Echo Show is impressive. It gets good and loud and has some real depth of sound. The voice recognition is significantly better than any of the Echo Dots I have in the house (there are now 3, don’t judge) and I absolutely can’t believe how good the picture quality is for the price. I was so pleased, I purchased a second Echo Show less than a week later.If you already have an Amazon device, this thing basically sets itself up in under 5 minutes. I am not tech savvy.

292,J. Brooks,its ok,"  I had a lot of hopes for this. I had an echo dot in my kitchen which I thought was neat but I always had to bring my laptop or tablet into the kitchen if I was making a recipe and was worried about getting food on them. I thought this would be the ideal option. In reality-this to me has just been an echo dot with a screen that is not nearly as useful as it could be. My life/calendar is not integrated with Alexa as the kids use it more than I do but I do use it to tell my iRobot to vacuum-which works about 70%of the time- and to play things on my TV with amazon prime. I do like it also for listening to the news and music, but the echo dot did all that, for much less. I wanted the screen so I could pull up my recipies or new recipes and do cooking stuff and maybe even call people. And this is what it does not do well. It does stuff but you have to figure out the magic words and way you have to ask it to do stuff. My wife told me not to get it and now she just laughs at me as I try to figure out the incantation that will make it work when if it was just an app button or something like that I could tap and move on with my life. Especially since it goes to sleep and then you have to say the correct incantation again to get back to where you were. At the end of the day I guess I wanted an ipad or something similar but I liked alexa better than siri for queries as I want something that responds to verbal instruction. You can video call people,...IF they have these devices,..so not too useful. Facebook/skype are better as can be used on multiple platforms as well as facetime as most friends family have some idevice. Price is good for what it does, I have to acknowledge that.

I thought it was me and rebooted, etc., but did some searching online and found that not only am I not the only person, this has happened before. It's not a one off.  I think it may have happened as recenty as a week ago for a two-hour span, during which the device is unusable despite it having the capability of doing things, but is disabled and handicapped by Amazon, unnecessarily. It feels like an Apple move that's fairly anti-customer in terms of it trying to make you do what it wants vs. it trying to conform to what the paying consumer wants.

I love always having the time and temperature displayed.  So far the hints constantly displaying on the screen hasn't bothered me.  Some of them are interesting.  The only complaint I have is that the Show does not make a sound to alert me when an Amazon package arrives. A message might flash on the screen, but I am not in the kitchen all the time.  I live in a condo and packages are left in the lobby, so it is important to get notified when my packages arrive.

I like the play everywhere feature where I can sync up music in multiple rooms. I also use it as my alarm clock and to control smart devices.  Alexa devices are great for setting alarms.  My biggest complaint is also related to using it as an alarm clock.  That is if your playing music or doing something else then the clock is not visible. That is not acceptable.  If I look at the clock I want to see the time not some screen full of garbage I am not interested in. I want something done so the the clock is always visible.  Time, weather, and checking ring cameras are the only things I use the screen for.  I want to be able to see the clock or it doesn't function as a clock.  I also join others in hating things to try.  Alexa works well for a few things.  Setting alarms, turning on-off smart devices, and making list.  I will occasionally use it for math.  Everything else is clunky and hard to use.  Simple internet questions like how old is some actor or what is the date works fine.  A complex question like when is the first day of early voting will not work. Amazon needs to stop pretending that Alexa can do complex things.  Just get it to function as an alarm clock and radio.

""Sorry, our products are just sensitive""... Wait what??I have have grown my collection of Alexa devices to 13 plus devices (not counting all the firesticks - several) since the first Echo came out years ago.I've got the original Echo (2), the dot (several and gifted), the spots (2), the echo auto, the echo show 8 (2), echo show 10, echo plus (2), oh and those Phillips bulbs they bundled? Those have suddenly quit staying connected... They have quit working (wifi/smart part) after a couple years. Fun times constantly manually reconnecting with SN and it might work a day or 2. That's how those fail.On to the echos. What they are failing in the past 6 months or so ever more often then no more working ever, hence this review:Bluetooth hook-up was 1st to become a chronic issue. It will have my phone connected then when I asked for it to connect in order to listen to something it can't find it. In fact it doesn't even try yet it is paired. I would attempt to unpair in order to repair and it would take forever to unpair. Finally it would and I would repair and it might work a few times, then suddenly I was doing it all over again. This is become a total pain. I finally quit even using it as a Bluetooth. This was happening on almost all devices. Very frustrating and useless as a Bluetooth.2nd issue: I have put my devices in music groups for years. Never had an issue at all. Now suddenly if I have more than 2 devices in a group, most of the rest will have complete Distortion going on. Doesn't matter the different groups I have going, the different combinations, different rooms, where they're located,  it's irrelevant. I have high-speed internet, I have an excellent router,  I have literally ruled out everything. Simply put, if I've got more than 2 devices together, even if they're all on the same network as in 2G, I am going to have distortion on any device past passed 2 in a group. Well I'm sorry that means you can't have group music playing. This is all new the past few months.

It's an IP cam that supports RTSP.Amazon wants to make it not ply well with other. Ok I'll buy others. Looks like a bit more $ but I'll go with a raspberry PI.ALSO, seriously, you can not set a routine to take you to a book marked web page?Wouldnt work as nicely as monocle but I could navigate to the IP address of my web cam and use it on the browser but I wanted this to quickly say ”Alexa, show me the front door”  if I wanted a tedious process of typing in an IP address with port designation I’d stick with the phone I have already purchased.Other than video calls to other people with this, what's the point?",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2020"
301,Michael Williams,Can be Glitchy,"  I had an Echo Show 5 that I was using as a bedside clock. I got this thinking the numbers would be bigger and easier for me to see without my glasses. The numbers are not bigger, so that was a fail. But I do like the bigger screen. My problem is that this Echo seems to more apt to glitches than other Echos. (As mentioned, I also have the regular Echo and the Echo Show 5.) As an alarm clock, more than once I've snoozed the alarm only to have it not go off again. It does NOT recognize a sleepy voice at all. At times it's gone unresponsive, which means it won't perform some basic tasks that should not require a connection. I've changed the alarm sound in the app, but it hasn't acknowledged the change and still plays the previous sound. Overall, I'm a big fan of the Echo products and this one is decent. But I just feel this one seems to have more glitches than the others.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2020"
302,Michael Williams,A series of useless devices capped off by this monstrosity.,"  What do you get when you combine a bare bones tablet with 75 mic's that can't hear you? The Echo Show.I've tried and tried and tried to like this thing. I've moved it so many times it should be given frequent traveler miles and no matter where I put it, it simply doesn't do anything but frustrate and annoy.I'm loud, clear and concise when I speak to it, yet every time, without failure, it ignores my commands and does whatever it wants to (usually nothing at all). For a device that's supposed to simplify life and make your home smarter, it does very little in that regard.We have routines set up which is supposed to be convenient groupings of commands so that all you need to do is say one command and the device will execute all of them. For example: my morning routine is automatically set up so when my alarm goes off, Alexa will tell me what time it is followed by music. The volume is at about 50%, it plays on shuffle music from my Prime music collection.I say ""Alexa, stop."" and she ignores me. The light bar appears on the screen, she does hear me say her name but never stops the music. I get louder. Nothing happens. This continues until I grab the device and yell into her to stop, then she complies. This is irritating and angering. This is not how I want to wake up each day.I've tried this in my kitchen. The sole reason I bought this initially was to be a helper in my kitchen for recipes and whatnot, but that failed me as well. She simply doesn't hear me. Ever. No matter where I place it, no matter whether or not I use commands or routines, the Show never hears me first, second or third go. For a device that claims to have a bunch of microphones, how is it that it never hears me?This device feels like a public beta. It hardly works and just infuriates the user.For more perspective; we have several echos around the house. I wouldn't have so many but both my wife and I own a few each and when we got married, they too blended into the family.All in all, we have 6 devices. 1 show, 1 first generation echo, 4 dots. The first gen Echo is just as bad as this Show 8, which I had hoped and stupidly thought would be a significant improvement since it's not a first generation Show.It is not.I only assumed it was significantly improved.I was very wrong.The original Echo has always been terrible for the same reasons, it cannot hear me. I'm not a quiet person, however when I speak I do so with clarity because I'm not an idiot. I don't just sit there and scream into the void hoping my voice is heard.These devices all have one major flaw in common from my use over the years, the microphones simply fail to hear you no matter the volume of your voice, the distance at which you speak or the commands you give.The tablet functions are severely limited and don't provide much help either. The mic's hardly work and it only serves to get your heart rate up with frustration. I'm done. I will no longer bother to try and I refuse to buy any additional echo devices. These are mostly trash and don't do anything to assist in making my home smarter or my life easier.It's been a little over a year since i bought this and couldn't be more dissatisfied with it. If i could return it, I would. It offers nothing to our home and is so limited in its abilities that it's pointless to have. There are other devices available out there, go get one of those. We will be.I've tried and tried to like this thing, but because of the never ending issues it's impossible to. Amazon, be customer friendly and take this thing back and replace it with one that actually works, please. Microphones that actually hear me and perform the commands given. So simple, right?Commands like  ""Alexa, stop."" And ""Alexa, turn off the screen."" ""Alexa, shut up!"" Should all yield results but don't.If the device has voice recognition and so many mic's you'd think it would be easy to understand me.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 15, 2021"
303,JD,Doesn't do what I got it for,"  I was so excited to get a Show for my kitchen! I watched the product video and loved that you could read the recipes off the screen while you were cooking. No more trying to wake up my phone and balancing it against the olive oil while hoping I didn't drip something on it!But when I brought up my Kindle-version cookbooks, Alexa would only read the book. You can't look at the pages at all. So unless you want to guess where your recipe is and don't mind having to shout 'Pause!' after every ingredient and direction, it's pretty much useless for any of your Kindle cookbooks. The only recipes you can read and swipe through are the ones suggested by Tasty, Food Network Kitchen, etc. And it's nice to see new recipes, but I want to make my own too! There is a work around by using another app to upload your recipes and then pull them up, but that seems ridiculous to have to type out all of my recipes that are already online into another app - and no, there is no copy and paste available to make it faster.Also, I was hoping to be able to access my Discovery Plus channel on the Show since you can access Prime Video and Netflix, but apparently Show does not support Discovery Plus. And if you opened your subscription through the Discovery Plus website, you can't transfer it to the Prime Channel.While the sound is great and there are nice other features, I was really disappointed that it doesn't do what I thought it could when I bought it. I think the advertisement for the Show is misleading, especially for us cooks who really wanted a recipe book and video player to keep us going in the kitchen!",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2022"

He was pleasantly surprised that I set it up by myself and even did the voice recognition which was so easy!  Alexa and I have become best friends and she keeps me on schedule with all my medications I have to take plus reminders as well.  This past Christmas my son went a step higher since he saw how much I loved my Echo Dot and gifted me with an Echo Show!  Omgosh, I am overjoyed with the excellent quality of the Echo Show's screen and big sound!  It took just seconds to set up and it sync'd with my Echo Dot giving me everything on my calendar along with Alexa recognizing who I was.  All my music sounds amazing and I can sing along with the lyrics right on the screen, which is such a cool feature!

305,Kevin M. Maier,Great until update,"  I purchased the Echo Show 5 for my home office in November 2020. I liked it so much that I purchased another Echo Show 5 for another room and an Echo Show 8 for my kitchen. I particularly liked seeing my pictures, the date and time, and the weather. Plus, I connected the Echo Shows to my Arlo security cameras and when needed, asked Alexa to show a live view from my security camera.A few weeks ago, an update to the Echo Show 8 made it so the screen regularly changes to an obnoxious blue screen titled “Alexa for your day”, which gives Amazon’s suggestions for things to try. This is totally obnoxious, so I contacted Amazon and learned there was currently no way to disable this “feature”.As of early April, my Echo Show 5’s have now also updated so that they regularly show the obnoxious screen titled “Alexa for your day”. I counted this occur 5 times in 30 minutes, so contacted Amazon and was again told I could not disable this “feature”. This is extremely upsetting because the new “feature” is totally distracting and definitely not what I agreed to when I purchased the devices (my husband describes it as having a billboard in the room). As such, I have now unplugged the devices. So, thanks to Amazon’s insistence that they have the right to invade my personal space, I spent money on a device that I can no longer use.As an aside, the representative agreed that the user should be able to deactivate this “feature” and said they would pass the recommendation along in the hopes that it will be available in a future update. I encourage anyone who dislikes this feature to send the suggestion via the Help and Feedback section.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2021"
306,DonM,Great Kitchen Assistant,"  This device is front and center on our kitchen counter. I use it primarily to pull up recipes, listen to music and turn on/off a variety of lights/devices in our home which are on smart plugs. I've had it for a little less than a month and am by no means familiar with all of it's capabilities.For online recipes it's terrific. I can ask it to find a recipe for X on website Y (or just look across the web), and it'll display all the relevant recipes. I can scroll through them, then pick one to see the details. It even links the ingredients to the shopping list in the Alexa app. When using a recipe, the display stays open and you can easily scroll through the different steps. It sits at an angle which makes it easy to read ( I didn't get a stand). Much better than using my tablet, which times out after a few minutes, so I have to keep logging in.For music, it visually displays all the available playlists, which I can scroll through and pick one. It displays the current song and performer. So much easier than using an Echo Dot. I was using a Dot together with my phone; this combines the capabilities of the two.I bought this to experiment with before buying some others as gifts for family members. Ultimately I want to use these as an easy way to visually connect with family.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2020"
307,Amazon Customer,A lot of options.,"  I like that I don't have to yell at it like at my google mini. It picks up the word 'Alexa' from across the room. It connects with my blink mini camera which is the main reason I bought the Echo. But I have to say I am so impressed with all the options Alexa has that I play with it quite often. I can open a browser, use You Tube, Netflix, of course all the Prime channels so when I am stuck washing dishes or baking I can watch my favorite series as Alexa is right by my sink. I can view video recipes. I play nature sounds at night to mute out my crazy cats, my favorite is babbling brook.I can DROP in! For examole my teenager is home alone I can just tap a button on my alexa app on my phone and I see the living room. If I buy one of rhe stands I will be able to aim it at the floor and visit my cats if we go away for the weekend. Talk to them, etc. Crazy cat family here!I can also announce things over the Echo. There is an option of buying another echo and set it to kids so that they could have it upstairs but not able to access rated shows etc.  I can also mute it and close the camera if I want privacy. I can also unplug it to make sure no one is listening. :-) One thing I do not like and will contact customer service about are the adds. I am a vegetarian but Alexa suggests recipes to me like meatball pie (sorry to meat eaters, but this made me feel sick to my stomach), or pork chops which was even worse as I love pigs as pets, they are smarter than dogs. Anyway, the point is I am not sure if adds are customizable. I also do not want to see any football adds and I do get those. Football is my second on the hate list, after meat and I do not enjoy it being pushed into my face. Overall I am very happy!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2021"
308,Bryan,"Beautiful, but a Bit Bassy","  I just now set up my new Echo Show 8. Took less than 5 minutes as I already have account. Nice big horizontal screen. I got this to replace/augment the Echo Spot, that resembles a round clock. I had that for 1 1/2 years, & it started jumping on screen lately & talking outloud to me when I didn't ask it to (room was quiet). I put that in living room where I practice guitar to jam along with it or to help me remember tune of song I'm learning. This 8"" rectangular Echo Show is lovely & the screen background constantly changes; Go to Settings, & pick the ""Wallpaper"" or background you want. There are 2 speakers, 1 on each side of the ""Show"" which helps the music really Rock, plus words come up for most part, which is cool. The only thing so far I don't care for, is the tone to Alexa's voice is very BASSY. I picked it up & held in my hands to see if it sounded better, but it doesn't. There is no knob to reduce bass or increase treble. Perhaps after a few days, it will straighten out. It has a nice big digital display of the date, time & temperature which I can see from bed better than with the ""Spot"", but I miss the Clock feature with the second hand, as I need to take my pulse for 15 seconds daily. I'll just set the timer. You can change sound of the alarm in clock in settings, & you can add your pictures from your cell phone or from Amazon Photos, if applicable, as well as several other things. Came with a little directions booklet. Anything you don't know how to use, just ask Alexa, or go to Support on your tablet or cell,etc. I'm so glad I got this.

309,Audra,Very cool product!,"  I am a gadget kind of girl. Even though I love gadgets I am also very careful with my money. I search for bargains and coupons on everything.

Even though I have tons of gadgets like an ice maker, a K-pod coffee maker a ninja blender, touch lights, motion sensor lights solar lights and colored bulbs and strips, mini-fridges, tons of cool camping gadgets, and so on and so on I can't seem to justify the expense of my own cell phone. I already have a house phone and my husband has a cell phone. I own 5 or 6 of them myself but never use them so I shut mine off. I absolutely love the calling feature on the Show. I just say call hubby and next thing you know we are on a video call. He loves that he can use an announcement to send me a message. Those are just a couple of features I love. when it comes to all the bad reviews with the announcement feature I am really surprised. I happen to like the announcements. It is non-obtrusive. They are just a few lines of text and last only a couple of seconds. The other day one popped up of the video of the mars lander and I happened to catch the announcement out of the corner of my eye so curiously I asked to see it and it was cool. I might not have thought to watch it otherwise. They also have introduced me to music I probably would have never hear. I am actually looking forward to seeing more. I also use my Show to turn on my colored light strips in the middle of the night when I want to get out of bed in the dark. I can adjust the brightness and color with only my voice. My Echo Show came with the blink mini and I am loving it. I can keep an eye on the pets without them knowing and next week I will be getting the outdoor camera to set up for more home and plan to get the thermostat just because it is located downstairs and I want to be able to adjust the temperature from the bed. lol now that might sound lazy but to me it's AWESOME!

310,Madbaldman,My Echo Family Has Grown,"  I've got several Echo devices...this is the first time I've had one with a video screen.  I received it as a Christmas present, along with a new generation Dot.  First, the Dot is VASTLY improved over previous versions.  The first Dots I had were pretty much useless without connecting them to a ""real"" speaker...the sound quality of the original Dots was pretty primitive.  However, this new Dot isn't bad at all!  I put it in my workshop and it's great for that application.  As for the Show, I really haven't used the video screen for much except for monitoring my Ring cameras, which works great.  The sound quality is better than the various other Echos I own (larger/stereo speakers).  I work from home and have the Show on my desk.  It's nice to be able to monitor my cameras for deliveries and so forth...and I pretty much listen to talk radio or music all day while I'm working.  Others have complained that constant content on the screen is annoying...and that there's no way to stop it.  It doesn't bother me...I don't sit around staring at it.  But I've found that you can tell Alexa to turn off the screen and it goes blank, without affecting what you're listening to.  I think you can also make it display your pictures in a slide show?

This text goes over whatever image you have on the screen. There is no way to turn it off. There are ways to disable other annoying 'features' but no way to durn this text off.I wish it would do a photo-frame for google photos, since my family seems to prefer google photos to amazon photos for sharing.Unlike the google hub, the echo show 8 does not black out the screen unless you tell it to, or schedule it to turn the display off.I am still working to integrate blink XT cameras to the Echo Show 8, but so far, it won't show the camera video. It says there are no recorded events, but can't show the current video from the camera.It works well with my other smart home switches, lights and other devices. That's a good thine.I like the audio quality of the echo show 8, compared to my other echo devices.The video conferencing feature is quite nice and the video and audio quality is quite good, only losing occasional packets between the two units. From what I read, it can work with Zoom meetings as well.The packaging is nice, but incredibly wasteful. I would have preferred they simply box it well instead of double or triple boxing it with custom cut cradle material to lift it from the box. Nice, but wasteful.

312,ShadowKat,So much better than the Echo Show 5!!!!!,"  I've purchased three of these so far, and will probably purchase more when the price-point drops again.  I gave one each to my mother and my mother-in-law, and kept one for use in my office.  I also have a full-size second generation echo show, two echos, and several echo dots, in almost every room of our house.  They are great for video/audio calls to grandparents/grandkids, for making announcements throughout the house, using as an intercom system, and working as a whole-house stereo system when you are home alone.  I tried the echo show 5 before, but was greatly disappointed at the quality of the speakers - they were tinny, and the microphones didn't work well either. At first, I thought it was just a defective one and sent it back for a replacement, but the replacement did the same thing, so it must've just been the design.  So, I was hesitant when I first ordered the echo show 8, but when I heard the superior sound quality over the previous echo show 5, I was so pleased that I ordered the other two for gifts.  Our kids and our mothers are all happy that they can easily make video calls to each other just by voice command.  I highly recommend integrating the echo dots into your household as well.  Our mothers have them (echo show and many echo dots) throughout their homes too, and it gives us all peace of mind knowing that if something happens and they find themselves in distress when home alone, they just have to speak loud enough for Alexa to hear them and help is on the way.

I found Most of the time I got answers like. I'm sorry I don't know anything about that. Whether it was a question or to control a device. I also often got Told that that device did not support that function. Turn on the kitchen light. Didn't support that. So I'd have to say hey, Google, And my command. Google did it no problem.

It wants you to purchase. In order to listen or you can listen to their stations or their shuffle. Of random stuff that prime members get free, I guess. Within an hour you have listened to the whole list and it loops back. Alexa constantly suggesting you may want to purchase.

I bought 1 Show 8 for work to replace my tiny Lenovo Google clock that has a bland clock face but it has large and readable clock numbers and gives you weather with condition backgrounds (rainy etc.) and NO try this, try that and the other thing.  The Echo Show 8 has a huge screen but tiny, unchangeable clock numbers, a small current temperature number and icon, none of which can be changed, and lame illustrated clock backgrounds unlike the nice Show 5 ones (you can put in your own photos via Amazon photos and/or use their nature or other photos).  If you play music or something else, the clock face totally disappears and you can't tell what time it is; e.g. if you are listening to music for a few hours, there's no clock face or overlay while the music is playing.  Also, if you are in any other function other than clock only, there is a non-stop Try This, Try That bar running along the bottom of the screen with no way to turn it off!  On the Show 5, at least you can set it so that it displays only once when you change the screen function and then it goes away.  The Show 8 does have a better screen type than the Show 5, it looks like the Show 5 has a TFT screen whereas the Show 8 appears to have an IPS or similar screen so you have better visibility off-axis.

315,JWID,"Alexa, Echo and It's Evolution","  First off, let me state that I've used Alexa mostly for audio/sound, so I found the idea of something with a screen interesting.  At best, this seems to be more of a novelty type item, perhaps if I wanted to cycle my pictures through on the screen I might enjoy it more.I'm pretty invested in the Alexa/Amazon ecosystem as I own several Echo devices (Std Echo, Dot, Echo Input, fire TV's and Echo Show).  For the money I paid ($65 on sale), I would probably purchase one these again because the sound is decent (my reason for 3 stars), I would be unhappy if I'd paid full price.As Alexa has evolved, she absolutely seems to get slower and dumber all the time.  I used mine for turning lights on/off, music, and some other automation.  Very little of it seems to work as well as when I purchased my first one.  I have also noticed lately several of my devices seem to reboot, not do what I ask, etc., overall I think Alexa overall is very buggy.One of the things I thought would be great with this, is asking to see my front door camera.  Well, if I had time to wait for the second coming of Jesus while it thinks about bringing up my camera after being asked a couple of times, it'd be great.  Otherwise I could walk to my front door and back a couple of times and look myself while I wait on it.If you already have one or more Echo devices, and you can get this on sale, I'd consider it.

I tried explaining to them (which I had to do with each of them) that when I purchased the Echo it had a smaller clock appearance. Then Amazon changed the clock size without my permission and now I want to return it for a full refund. They just agreed with me but would not give me a supervisor which I asked for a number of times. After over 2 hours of frustration I ended the chat. I am now going to sell my echo show 8 and purchase another photo frame with a smaller clock. After all, I didn’t purchase the echo as a clock but as a photo show frame.

319,Lois Plone,Great sound but limited in capability,"  First and foremost, the sound out of this little thing is quite good.  Good punchy bass without being overbearing or muddy.  And the screen is sharp and colorful.  It is great for listening to music or watching videos.  I also love being able to have it cycle through classic pieces of art as a screensaver.That said, it is unnecessarily hobbled by Amazon. I honestly wish it had the functionality of the Fire Tablet mixed with the convenience of an Echo.  It has so much potential that is wasted. It does the basics really good (music player, timer, smart device control, etc.), but it is missing some basic skills that would push it over the top.  For example, it would be a great whiteboard to leave notes for other household members.  It would be great to be able to add additional favorite recipe sites.  And where is Netflix or Disney+ for video viewing.I'm not as bothered as others are by the repeated suggestions offered when in standby mode.  And in the long run, it does the main things it needs to do really well.  I recommend it but with slight caveats.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2020"

Some people might want to watch a show, say a (Amazon Prime) show.  Not possible.  Not that it is the biggest screen, but it would be great to watch a show while cooking.

It was especially a treat to find out I could trade in my first gen Show. I am one who keeps the original box and takes good care of my devices.I returned my first-gen Show in the original box, by the way, it was working when I unplugged it and put it in the box. I was expecting to receive $30 for the trade-in and received $5 because the item was not working. To my surprise, that was the response I received.I am very disappointed because that was not the case and I can't get anyone to listen to me or verify. I am not in a good place.

When this echo 8 went to the most affordable cost effective price.  I was like SCORE !!!!!! I had also gotten the Ring doorbell & this would be a great companion. This Echo show on a daily basis I think..... I think this baby is going to make my electric bill go up. I just know it.  I am frustrated ,because this devise has so much promise if only Amazon cared enough. The display is tacky. It’s not a good monitor.  In this day & age when you can get the lowest price Apple phone at a budget price. This screen reminds me of 1982. See sometimes Amazon gives you stuff to get you sucked in their world. They should have given it a little more class ,and forethought. Like you apparently don’t care enough about your customer to give them a good enough experience ,or you simply are a tacky used car salesman. Let us change the display. A little more options. Let us make it in to different clock options. I could be here all day speaking the gospel about this product. It’s just not worth it. The dot was like wooooooooow a little machine can do so much. Even the music out of the dot in the beginning was impressive. Now with this Echo Show 8. Not impressive.  I could break everything down. I don’t have time. Let me say what it does do right........ I can see who’s at my door with Ring very well & its response is faster then Ring’s actual website. I actually think the dot seemed smarter ,and more intuitive.

323,GeekyPhotogMomSings,Love the Echo 8 that I bought another for me & one for my sister,"  I am not sure how many people sit and stare at the ECHO in their home.  That is the only way the suggestion would bother you.  I have one in the living room and one in the kitchen.  I can turn my lights off and on, my kids call from school (which is awesome) and I can watch my front door (Using a Blink camera). If I don't need it, I am not looking at it, and unlike Google home, it doesn't just speak randomly.  Alexa could use some updates on slang and search results (has trouble with historical references we ask during movies) but other than that, it works great.  We have Echo Dots in every room so we can give our kids wake up calls and remind them of lights out.  Its fun and does what we need it to do.The set up time for Blink/Cell phones/Dots all took less than 2 minutes.  Power plugs take a little longer (10 min) and require a separate app (which is a pain in the beginning) but once set up, you never have to do anything again.Loosing power does not require new set ups or passwords to be entered.I now choose smart home extras based on whether or not they are ECHO compatible.  Stay away from the cheap import knock offs.  Spend the extra money and buy ones Alexa is already set up to be compatible to.

324,Dale I,Cool upgrade from the regular dots.,"  I have several alexa dots around my house, this one is an upgrade. The sound quality is better just for listening and when using it to call people, I have been told the sound quality is better. That said, overall sound quality when using any alexa to call people kinda stinks. This is a part of the product they could stand to improve. Calls will sound very echoy on all alexa devices as if standing in a bathroom talking.  The Show 8 does do better with that than the regular dots, but still has a long way to go. Size is great. I can see what is on the screen easily. It is a triangular shape and not flat at all. I did not realize that. If you are looking to flush mount it to a wall, this is not for you. There is no way to do that because even cutting into the wall will result in blocking the speakers. I do wish the constant news headlines and stuff that pop up would stop. My kids end up opening news when they see the headline and it isn't always stuff I want them seeing. I have it set to show photos on a screen saver. Kind of like a digital frame. I wish those would just stay on and the headlines and other things that rotate through would stop.

325,Ken325,"""Alexa for your day"" can't be disabled!","  Amazon makes it very difficult, and sometimes impossible, to disable the constantly rotating messages.  They have settings to disable such things as ""Helpful Hints During COVID-19"", ""Trending Topics"" and ""Popular on Alexa""... but then they will push a firmware update and suddenly you get ""Alexa for your Day"" shoved in your face and you CAN'T disable it (Google it for an endless stream of people asking how).  If you try to disable all notifications so that you get nothing but a clock... you will end up with a clock that fades to black constantly.  You can ask Alexa to turn off the screen, but it is only for a minute or two until she wakes up again.  There is no way to make the device just sit there and do nothing.  It is a constant distraction.  And now ""Alexa for your day"" can't be disabled at all (which promotes Amazon products).",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2021"
326,Oceans24,Worth it if discounted,"  Probably worth it when it goes on sale, and the quality packaging makes it a great gift. The hardware build feels excellent. The screen is bright in sunlight and automatically dims to a night mode when dark. Sound is different (I'd say better) compared to my echo. Drop-in and video calling features are pretty useful when communicating with family members; most of us put our phones on silent nowadays so another way to reach them is always a plus. I mainly got this to integrate with my Ring doorbell - so far so good (the Ring cloud is a bit slow sometimes, but that's not this product's fault).Cons: I put this in my bedroom, so my main use as part of my daily routine is to check the time and the weather before I leave for work. So I do wish the clock can be made full screen both normally as well as in night mode. I'd also like to be able to give it context (i.e. if it's between 7a and 9a, always show today's weather details, and show a large clock the rest of the time). These are simple software fixes, so hopefully it'll get rolled out soon because the hardware seems well made.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2019"

Skype integration needs more work to improve performance.  The $10 guide should be included in the box.  Who ships a product without instructions?  Amazon... that's who.  Not everything is electronic - particularly if you don't know what to look for online on how to get the full value out of this product.  The speakers and sound quality falls a little short of expectation, but it's a major improvement over the dot.  You shouldn't have to buy the echo show and a separate speaker system to get the full sound that should have been built in.  I'm not saying that it should sound like a Bose, but something better than a portable radio should be the standard.  The screen quality is very very good.That said, it's a great product if you can get it at the sale price ($79).

328,BryM,Only 4-stars because it's an extremely underpowered/limited function Alexa product,"  Amazon could give me a 15"" picture frame version of this with an i7 processor 16gb of ddr5 ram & a gtx3060 in it... that would still only get 4 stars because literally none of that would ever get put put to use with how restricted & locked down the Alexa products are. They have 1 function. To be alexa..Alexa... and this one does that. Enter than any of the products I've tried this far so it's an A+ for price and an A- for function. Almost never catches the wake word first time I say ""alexa"" unless I make a point to say it with some authority... to be honest my echo dot 3rd gens were the BEST, most reliable when it came to recognition and waking that I've ever experienced. Aside from that one minor issue though, this device does what it supposed to and for $50-60 what more could you ask for in a replacement for your boring ol' bedside alarm clock, really?...👍Also, it's just a little slow to get up and moving in general most of.the time, but once it's ""woke"" you're almost always good to go with this version of Alexa. Only gripe I have is how slow my camera feeds load up when asking Alexa to show me ""blank""... it's a solid 15 second+ load time before the live/low latency video is streaming to me from my blink mini or my blurams 2k dome camera, either one. Great quality once they are streaming but that loading time is a killllller when it comes to say - getting a motion alarm notification at my driveway camera and I say ""Alexa show me the driveway""...immidiately Alexa says ""okay"" and it starts laoding................Somebody could have siphoned half my tank of gas out of my car by the time it starts playing lol realistically though.On the flip side, no star retraction for this because I know its got alot to do with my camera running on the 2.4ghz only band on my router which makes the latency (reaction/tranfer times) as well as the video stream loading, cloud writing and basically every function to do with the cameras at all - 2-5x slower than if they were connected to the one of the TWO 5GHz bands broadcast by my asus RT-3200AC wireless router, instead of using the ancient 2.4ghz protocol, and even this 1st gen echo show is connected via 5Ghz, so I'm sure that dosent help that it has to locate the camera it's and everything through my router and on switch to the 2.4ghz band everytime i want to see the stream i would assume is where the excess load times come into play past 12-15second every once in a while... which is kind of a major issue if you really think about how much malicious stuff a person could really get done in a matter of 10-15 seconds while you cant see a thing and have no clue because you echo show screen just says ""loading stream...."" for those precious 10-15 seconds that they really are in that type of situation... Not to mention the 5-10seconds that it takes for the notification to play from alexa that motion was even detected in the first place... 🙃 BUT im sure i could cut all of these times down to about 1/3 or less hat they are currently with this confoguration by spending a ton of money on 5ghz cameras instead of the 2.4ghz band to match what this device is connected to and automatically boost the entire system 150% even without matching the bands because 5ghz is just that much faster and lower latency. (This configuration is still totally acceptable knowing its my cameras, not this device for normal scenarios like seeing who just pulled up in your driveway for example. Just not fast enoughin a crucial situation where somebody's crazy ex runs up and stabs 1 tire and is gone from the frame before the stream ever even loads leaving you wondering if there's something wrong with you motion detection again or what that was about because you can't see anything by the time it's loaded 🤨🤔) overall a great little bedside assistant gor the money. If money were nk object though, the latest version gen 2 is no doubt much faster and a little less laggy than this one I would assume so yah... if you have a bunch of those exes/concerns, just spend double for that one, it's worth it looking back now 😆",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2022"

Actually easier than the insttructions make you think it is. Gives impression you must have app. Nope. Called help for installation assistance. (Side comment-They were friendly and helpful. Definitely ""good vibes"" about help) They had me plug it in and it just went through a few gyrations & was up and running. Didn't need app! Didn't even need help. I guess Alexas talk to each other.Only negative is based on my biology, not Alexa technology.. My high frequency hearing is SHOT. Bought Alexa echo (not dot, full echo) for hi fi sound. Thought it might help. Nope. Treble is adjustable but not enough to match my 80 dB rolloff.  If you have my problem you might stay with the display rather than the echo. At least part of the time the screen parrots what Alexa says. This may well be an unfair comment, Alexa was never advertised to be a medical assistant. The treble boost actually does help, just not enough for meThe only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 on integration is I haven't done a lot of it. All I have is the two plug-ins and they work FINE.

330,Patty L 455,This is an awesome device!,"  When I purchased this as a birthday gift for myself, little did I know that I would lose my sight literally the same day I received my Echo Show. That morning, when I woke up blind, I was obviously scared and overwhelmed. (An emergency Dr's visit found the retinas in both my eyes detached overnight.)I distracted myself by plugging in my Echo Show and I was actually able to get the settings to enable the device to literally speak everything on the screen to me. After that, I really enjoyed playing with it as I ""looked"" through all the settings and discovered many of the things this can do. I loved being able to say, ""Alexa, call Sherry"" or whoever I wanted to talk to. That, in itself, made this an extremely valuable tool for me since I couldn't see my phone.I've had to endure 2 surgeries on my eyes and ongoing partial blindness, so I passed the time listening to music, audio books, and even TV shows and movies via Prime services. All I needed to do was tell Alexa what I wanted, and if she displayed options on the screen, all I needed to do was touch the screen and Alexa would read the entire dialog to me.Now, I realize that most of you reading this are not blind, however, I cannot stress enough how easy it was to enable this device to be so helpful for me! If I could do it while blind (with very little help at first), then anyone should be able to set it up and customize the settings, of which there are many different options available. At first, I found that Alexa spoke a bit too fast for me, but there are settings to change the voice speed, tone, and volume.There's no way I could write everything I have found in this amazing device. I must say, however, as I continue to deal with limited vision in one eye and continued blindness in the other, multiple Dr's appts. and surgeries, I have found this Echo Show to be an invaluable tool in many ways.

The Amazon Alexa/Echo techs have stated that the problem in my case is with Blink since Blink is responsible for the Blink Skill app. The common denominator here is the Echo Show 8.  I am changing my rating to one star and would give zero if I could!Original review:After wasting much time and effort I discovered that the Blink XT2 and Blink Skill does not work reliably with Show 8 in either Best or Enhance resolution. A real bummer as the Saver resolution is not satisfactory for me. Integration with the Blink cameras is the main reason for purchasing the Show 8.When I ask Alexa to show me the camera I usually get the OK response, a short delay then camera sound but no video. Sometimes Alexa says OK then shortly announces ""Something must have gone wrong"".Blink reportedly has actually been aware of the problem for months and is promising a fix in the future but is not saying when. If it is taking so long to fix it must be a major flaw or it is a ""back burner"" project for them. I have not seen anything in either the Blink or Show documentation/advertising that lets customers know NOT to expect integration in anything but the ""Saver"" mode.Needless to say I am not a pleased customer. I would give the Show 8 only one star based on the problem with Blink but other features work well for the most part so far.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2019"

However, I heard that most Alexa devices with displays have terrible sound quality, and I wanted good sounding music throughout my system.  So I bought the Show 8 for $99.  The sound is pretty good- it distorts a bit when turned up very high, but for regular listening it is quite sufficient  It did group with my other Echo devices to make Amazon Music or Pandora play from an  ""all speakers"" group, with was one of my primary tasks.I really don't ""use"" the screen much.

What I really, really, really dislike is asking Alexa a question. If it isn't the weather or a canned Alex app question, she doesn't know much. Most times I give up, grab my phone & google it. Amazon is one of the wealthiest companies in the world & can't provide Alexa with more IQ? If you google, yes google, Alexa vs Google is says Google is generally more intelligent. That's a pretty political & nice statement. In my book it's 98% of the time. I have a Lenovo smart display & it still forces me to ""google on my phone"" sometimes, so nothing is perfect, but Alexa is so much worse. I would love my Echo Show, maybe have one in all the rooms, if it wasn't so stupid. And can we change her voice?

You cant cast/play Spotify from multiple accounts to one device. So when different members of my family want to play their music to this Echo they literally can’t. Amazon is only allowing one Spotify account to be registered with each Alexa/Amazon account for each individual Echo device. (This issue is not present with competing speakers and video devices)-The “Tap” feature is very under developed. You really have to voice command every thing you want every single time. I understand that’s the main gimmick with these smart assistants, but sometimes it’s just nice to be able to turn on a playlist with a couple taps like on your phone or tablet instead of shouting to Alexa “Alexa! Play my relaxing evening tunes playlist on Spotify” (and of course it has to be *my* Spotify playlist, not my wife’s or one of my kids etc etc).-No full screen clock. Perplexing as it’s apparently an option on the Echo Show 5.Here’s to hoping they decide to play nicer with Spotify, add a full screen clock, and allow more tap integration for those who need the accessibility option or just don’t always want to have an awkward conversation with a robot every single time.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2020"

338,Christina,"Cell phone required, elderly people may not understand speech due to heavy bass tone.","  This is my first, and probably last, Alexa device.  I never enabled it on my Fire tablets until I needed to setup the Echo Show.1.  The bass is so strong that I cannot understand Alexa (and most other speech) without hearing aids.  I can more or less get by by blocking the top speaker with a heavy book or by turning it upside down.  This absorbs most of the lower frequencies (and still sounds good for music). My parents have no hope of understanding it.2.  The Kasa smart plug requires its very own phone app to work.  Blink cameras also have their own app, but I got one for the Fire Tablet.  Then there's their servers to deal with - not as quick as Amazon's.3. The deal breaker:  After I bought two of these, I was notified of the new SIDEWALK feature which ""When enabled, Sidewalk uses a small portion of your Internet bandwidth to provide these services to you and your neighbors.""  The problem is that it is apparently enabled by Amazon by default but I cannot disable it because my cell phone is not compatible with the new Alexa App - it is a couple of years too old.  So now, unless I want to share an unknown ""small portion"" of my internet bandwith with my neighbors - and anyone else within range - I will need to return the Echo Shows or buy a new phone.  I chatted with support and there is no way to disable Sidewalk without the phone app.  As I said, this is the deal breaker for me.  I cannot control the device I bought from Amazon without third party devices and services.  What happened to the kindle or Fire Alexa app?  Shouldn't Amazon be supporting their own ecosystem?4.  Alexa is fun to play with, but not really useful.  I already have a list keeper, a calendar keeper, and alarm clock.  It reminds me of the early network days when everyone had a dumb terminal connected to the mainframe.  This is sort of a step back in functionality with the fun of voice control.Conclusion:  A fun toy but not worth allowing Amazon to allocate my internet bandwith and access.UPDATE:  On the suggestion of Amazon's support chat, I installed an android emulator (bluestacks) then installed the Alexa app and managed to disable Sidewalk.

The Show is HEAVY and it sits, naturally, tilted back so the screen faces up more or less. So when doing a video call, I had to prop a 1"" chunk of wood under the backside to tilt it down enough for my kiddo to even see the screen when it was set on a kitchen counter.•  Video calls only work if the other person has the Alexa app. So to make a call to the grandparents, which I thought would be easy for my 7yo, I have to alert my parents they will have an incoming call via the app (ON their phone, but only via the Alexa app). The best scenario is to communicate Echo Show-to-Echo Show (so I guess I'm buying one for them too–way to upsell me Amazon!). But this also means it's not portable (like a phone) and the placement/viewing issue (above) is still a problem.• The buttons on the top are very small and hard to see.

341,daalisia,Music and Photos With Built in Video - What's Not to Love,"  After 16 years of marriage my husband I have arrived at a stage in our life where gift giving is no longer relegated to birthdays and holidays because we have the disposable income of an established couple with no children. In short, if we want something, we buy it. Christmas gift giving was once an ungodly stressful event  until we decided to stop with the gifts. This year however, I saw the Echo Show and decided to take a chance and surprise my favorite spouse with a present for his work office. He loves having family photos on display, but his iPad is old and does not always connect to the very secure office network and he enjoys playing music, but he needs to have his phone available for calls and his work computer is a PC and cannot hold personal files. The Show is really the perfect solution.When he opened the box his first reaction was suspicion because our house is currently overflowing with Alexas. We have so many Alexas in fact that there is an unopened Dot on our dining room table, we sent two brand new Dots to my brother and we have an older Dot that will be needing a new home after its replacement arrives next week. Once I started to explain the features of the Show a bit of excitement started to build. I knew I had him hooked when he plugged it in immediately and asked Alexa to play music and the lyrics popped up on the screen so he could sing along. ""This is pretty cool.""Then he started tweaking the settings and the home screen and added a background photo. It was all very easy. I use Amazon Photo storage as a backup tool for all of my family photographs. There are currently around 20,000 photos that are thankfully loosely organized into albums. I spent a good 4 hours creating a new 250 photo Echo Show album and then because my husband is a family vault member and can see all of my photos he can add photos to the album. The slideshow feature is really his favorite part of the whole Show. He loves the music, he loves Alexa, but he really loves having photos on his desk.The Echo Show's first week in his office was a success and when his boss stopped by his office, she loved the Show so much she ordered her own. My husband is able to listen and sing along to his music and see his family. We ordered a Show for our kitchen and my parents ordered one for their kitchen so we can easily make video calls between all of us during the day. Now if anyone can tell me what to do with all of these Dots, I would really appreciate it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2019"
342,Bear,"""Alexa, show Front Door"" - works great with my camera.","  I got this to integrate with my Eufy wi-fi front door camera. I have it in my family room. I installed the Eufy Skill which integrates with my Eufy Camera app and Alexa. Now, if I get a notice that someone is at my front door, I just say, ""Alexa show front door"" and within a few seconds I can see the front door and who is there. I read some complaints about the delay in showing the front door... with any wi-fi camera, there will be a slight delay. In my case, the Eufy camera has about a 3-second delay and the Show has about a 3-5 second delay connecting with the camera. So maybe a 5-10 second delay total for me.The sound quality is quite good for a rather small device (I have the 8"" Alexa Show). Screen size is perfect for me - not too big or small. I have it connected to my Amazon photos to play slideshow. I disabled the ads in the settings - just say ""Alexa show settings"" to get to settings. I will eventually disable the Alexa hints that show at the bottom of the screen. For now, it is interesting things you can ask Alexa to do. The clock is a nice feature - shows time in upper left corner. When it is dark, the screen goes dark and shows time larger in the lower-left corner. When watching TV with lights off, the screen dims but still plays slideshow. Occasionally, I will say, ""Alexa turn off-screen"" and then I get a dark blank screen (no clock). I'm not sure if there is a way to just show a dark screen and clock - no slides.I still have my Alexa Echo Mini in the same room - on the other side of the room. When I ask a question it depends which I am closer to for receiving an answer (or playing music).So far, I am very happy with it. I have the camera blocked with the sliding shutter for privacy. I may get my father one so we can talk via Show and see each other - hands-free talking. Maybe next time there is a sale.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2020"

On those counts this delivers fully and then some. The stereo is outstanding. While I am pleased with most of the features, there are a few That either lag behind other Echo devices or simply are missing...First is the clock. I love the Spot and the clock is easy to read from across the room in the dark with the night setting. The Show 8 just doesn’t seem to provide the same clock face nor visual acuity level.Second, you cannot simply ask Alexa for settings. You have to physically touch the screen to change settings. With the Spot you simply ask and Alexa brings up the settings.That said, I really like the unit and especially the great scenery that now graces my desk and changes continually. Probably the best of the Show devices so far...with a couple of twists to iron out.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2020"

346,LucyRed1967,Please make it easier to navigate amazon music,"  So basically I wanted a device that I could hook up to my amazon music account and that I could use to watch Netflix/ Hulu/ amazon prime with. This fits that bill and obviously so much more. I understand that this isn’t a fire tablet, however I miss the ease of the amazon music app on my tablet and phone. With the app I could scroll through music, my playlists, find songs and even look up stations with no frustrations. With the echo it seems everything has to be done verbally. “Echo play my recently added playlist.” “Echo play *this* song.” And it will but I can’t hop on and scroll through the playlist. I can link my phone to the echo and open amazon music and it will play through the echo but then it takes away Echos onscreen lyrics which are pretty cool. I really hope they work the music situation out because then the echo would be perfect. It was pretty easy to hook up to my Facebook and pull pictures to it like a digital photo frame. It was also easy to log into my Netflix/ Hulu/ amazon prime account. I’m still looking through the tricks it can do and figuring out how to video call my moms echo but again those are all bonuses to what I needed from this device.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2020"
347,J. Porcelli,Clearly 5-star... except this,"  I have deducted a couple of stars because of the lack of documentation.  There are several Kindle how-tos's on Amazon, but inclosed documentation is less than what you see in the item description.  It has many great features, but getting everything working right will be frustrating if this is your first Echo/Alexa device.  The first thing is that ""skills"" replaced ""apps"", and you will be disappointed if you are expecting this to look and feel like a touch-screen Android.  Essentially, it is a speaker system (Echo) with added video, controlled by voice (Alexa).  If talking to a computer is good for you, then this would be easily 5-stars if they provided documentation that you could at least print out on a computer.  Many, many features once you figure out how to use them, and the video and sound are outstanding.  Once I was able to add my SiriusXM and Hulu accounts everything is good.  I'm certain there will be many more uses in the future.  Unlike computers that you buy to solve a problem,  an Echo Show provides an ""Easter egg hunt"" to discover what it can do for you, probably many things that you would not expect.  For example, if you whisper to it, it whispers back.  Recommendation: When you buy your Echo Show be sure to order the how-to book at the same time.  You will need it.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2020"

349,Robert Van Cour,We Love our Alexa Show,"  OMG!  This is one of the greatest inventions!  My husband and I love it.  We have first had one Alexa Echo that I adopted in the family room which doubles as my sewing room and it has a kick-ass speaker so I could blare my Amazon music when nobody was around.  It alerts me that my packages have arrived, tells me the latest headline news, plays jeopardy with me, and after I installed the Ring Video Doorbell, Alexa tells me when someone is at the door and it also plays the doorbell chime I picked out and many, many other things.  Then I decided to get the Show and I set it up next to my husband's side of the bed.  He thinks he is so funny because he tries to ""drop-in"" on me but Alexa alerts me to this so he's not as sneaky as he thinks.  Then like a child, he asked Alexa to fart and holy cow!  He is just like a child laughing hysterically when Alexa farts.  So my husband adopted the show and loves asking Alexa to show him who is at the front door.  He set it up so his FB pictures shuffle on the screen and he really enjoys that.  There is an unlimited amount of skills that can be enabled that I don't think we will ever know them all.It's a great product that I recommend for every household.

I would like to see Amazon create a feature to lock down the screen with a passcode or be able to lock it down. The only way I have been able to lock it down is to set that device up every night as an Amazon Kids Device and assign it to a child of mine. Then use the Parent Portal to limit a time frame on when its locked down. Then when I wake up I have to disable that feature so my wife can use it normally.

We LOVE the Echo Show 8. It's size is perfect for a kitchen ecosystem, and it fits perfectly into the home as the hub of our smart home (smart switches, smart plugs. smart thermostat) nothing all that crazy.Really, you buy these devices for sound (the Echo Show 8 is excellent in this domain (good rich vibrance and resonance) as well as the screen ( the Echo Show 8 runs circles around the Show 5 in this domain). I've never had the 10 Echo Show, but honestly, I feel the Show 8 fits just into the ""just right"" category.Simply put, if you already love the Echo ecosystem, add this. The Show 5 is a great alarm clock, but if your going to interact alot (we average probably 20-25 Show 8 interactions), get the Show 8, you really won't regret it. Like others, do I wish it had a way to take off the things to try...of course.  That said, am I going to be petty and mark down the entire things for that design flaw? No, I won't.

The larger screen of the show 8 is something that was suprising to me. I actually like it less than I do the smaller screens on the google Nest Hub and show 5. I got it because I thought I wanted a bigger screen and a better speaker. Both of these reason didn't pan out. If I wasn't so lazy I would return it for a second Google Nest hub or a straight echo speaker.The Far field mics on most Alexa devices are great including this one.

I've only had it a couple of days, but these are a few of the things I've discovered it can do. When you play music, it sounds great and it usually brings up a screen with lyrics. It shows several temperature displays when asking about weather. It will link to your Ring doorbell and display the video from it. It opens easy to read recipes with a simple request. It plays music videos. You can pick what types of data or pictures you would like displayed on your home page. It also displays your Google calendar and reminds you of tasks.

355,BlackKnight,"Annoying to use as a photo display, plug-powered only.  It's gotten worse since I got it.","  Update:  It has become even more intrusive!  I want to see photos of friends and family.  In the space of five displays of my photos, it gave me three photos and two for the following, either showing a product I bought on amazon that was delivered (Yesterday) or suggestions ""show me nearby barbershops"" for example.  These take the place of the photos.  This is a disincentive to buy products on Amazon.  Why should I have to look at them over and over?  It's also not that reliable as a speaker, though I'm still using it.  Maybe there's a way to kill these two features, but since they started on their own, without me choosing them, why should I have to spend my time trying to figure out if I can disable them.  Downgraded the number of stars.  Finally, the time and temp are small in the corner sometimes and then big sometimes meaning they cover a good portion of the photos.  The big text never covers their stupid suggestion screens/screens showing me products I've bought.  Just the photos.  What genius comes up with these ideas?I wanted to display photos.  It does that, but the ""say Alexa. . ."" messages keep appearing and there's apparently no way to get rid of them.  I got rid of plenty of other junk, like alarming headlines and sports announcements, but still no way to stop this distracting screen clutter when I want to see my photos.  Spent a lot of time trying to get rid of this and now believe the many folks saying it can't be done.  Why????I wanted to add my own recipes so I could read them in the kitchen.  Can't do that.  You can use a subscription recipe service that will give you lots of recipes you don't want or you can give your recipes to said service (they then own them), then search for them in all the clutter.  No thanks.  Or it will read aloud kindle cookbooks, but won't show the recipes written on the screen.  Who cooks with verbal instructions alone???I wanted to use it as a speaker.  It's okay for that and paired easily enough with my mac.  Not a superior speaker, but ok for watching movies on streaming, or hearing too quiet youtube videos.There is other functionality, but I don't want to spend hours trying to figure it out and then find out it won't work.  I also don't like giving my voice recordings to Amazon automatically.  I'd rather have to opt in than erase them after the fact.No battery, so it can't be unplugged, limited to where you can put it.  Not sure it deserves the prime real estate next to my computer, but for now I'll keep an open mind and hope it grows on me.  If it does, I'll change the rating.I had great hopes for this, but so far it just has a bunch of stuff I'll never use and the useful things I could use don't exist or are flawed.  Right now it's mainly a clock/speaker/photo display with pop up messages.  Lots of people have asked to have these features added or changed, but Amazon doesn't seem interested.If you want a smart home system this may be useful.  Otherwise, there are probably better options.  For people who use Windows, they are used to devices with lots of bloatware they don't need.

356,down2xroads,Distorted Garbled Audio After Bluetooth Speaker Disconnects,"  This thing works fine for me except for one recurring issue.  The sound quality out of the Echo becomes oddly distorted and garbled after I disconnect my Bose Mini Soundlink Bluetooth speaker from the Echo.  The Alexa voice continues to sound perfectly normal but any streamed audio like radio.com or Amazon music sounds like it is being played under water and at a much lower volume.  If I turn on my Bluetooth speaker again, it automatically reconnects and starts to output the streaming audio that sounds perfectly fine.  The issue is the Echo audio.  Changing the Echo's audio equalizer settings have no effect on the sound once this distortion starts.  It is like the equalizer DSP has crashed inside the Echo.  When the Echo audio is working normally, the equalizer also works as expected.The only way to remedy this is to unplug the Echo for at least 30 seconds then power it back on.  Note that I called this a ""remedy"" and not a ""fix"" since a power cycle only restores the Echo to working state but the underlying root cause of the issue remains.  The issue happens quite frequently - not every time. But, this problem didn't start happening until mid-December 2020.  I don't see an easy way to provide feedback and get support from Amazon so I'm sharing my experience here.  I'm a former embedded systems programmer and this surely sounds like a firmware issue and not a failed hardware issue.There have been plenty of other reports of this same type of garbled sound from other Echo users.  I'm hoping enough people have this issue and complain to get Amazon to finally take notice and fix their product.Cheers.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2021"
357,Mikelll,Just okay,"  Let me start off by saying that me and my kids love all of our alexa and echo devices. As for the show, I love the ability to display rotating pictures of my kids all day. As for the voice recognition, as with all alexa devices, its only okay. They still have troubles with basic functions - like finding a song. We will say a song, and it will find it, no problem. Then the next day, it won't be able to find the song. I will ask it what it thinks I said, and it will say what I said - yet still no song. As for the sound quality, the show is rather disappointing. However, my main gripe with these devices is that you can only choose from 4 wake up words. And since I have a daughter whose name is very simular to Alexa, that leaves us with only 3 choices, and honestly you can't make it computer since that word is said in everyday conversation regularly. Amazon could be used in certain rooms, but its ridiculous that there aren't 10-20 or 50+ choices for the wake word. This can't be hard to program. So while me and my kids will certainly continue to enjoy these devices, there is so much room for improvement its crazy.

I can't count the BASIC things I've asked Alexa, who responds with ""I don't know that"" - only to turn around and ask the same of Siri and/or Google and get qualified responses.Bottom line:I could have saved my time and money and skipped this whole Echo Show.I will admit that it has awesome sound (definitely a plus) - but other than that, it's not much worth it to me.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2021"

364,Darthdude,"Pretty Cool, it's the same old Alexa with a screen.","  I wasn't really expecting to be blown away by this item, and I'm really not. It does give you that futuristic feeling like your in the movie Aliens and Sigourney Weaver is calling you, getting you out of a sound sleep to make sure you're not bringing them back to study!! ha. First thing that came to mind when I used the Camera. Which is a nice feature, though 1MP, that's a little strange. Though it's pretty clear. But a little ""invasive"" with the drop in feature, which can be adjusted. The screen is VERY touch sensitive, which is good if you use it, and that's actually, rarely. Since the voice recognition is excellent.I find myself mostly using my voice most, since that's really what it's designed for. Alexa is integrated MUCH better and she it super responsive, compared to the old models. Almost overly so. The screen isn't really that bright which is good, and it's not a strain on the eyes. However I don't picture myself watching much on Amazon Prime Video on this device. For that it's really for the ""Kitchen"" area for people who spend time in their cooking, eating, or sitting working on something at the table. Then i can picture it being like a small TV in the background like from the 80's, when people use to keep up on their Soap Operas.My biggest disappointment overall it the sound, louder isn't always ""better"". The lack of high end just really doesn't cut it for me when I'm listening to music on it. It seems to have good panning, but the bass (on this model) is just to overwhelming in my opinion. Even when Alexa speaks it's very very low end, even boomy. But for the price, it's a very cool gadget. The wireless works perfect, and the range is incredible. Probably the best I've seen on anything, no interruptions, pausing, stuttering, or anything like that. So if you're in the market for a ""New Alexa"" this one is the right price, and I definitely recommend it over the others. Even next to your bed you may want to watch a short episode of your favorite sitcom or something. But whole movies? Not so much. So I like it, and it's very innovative.

365,Customer,The sound and size are perfect!,"  Prior to purchasing the Echo Show, I had the Echo Spot and was looking to trade it in for something newer. The Echo Shows were on sale and I was offered decent money to trade in the Echo Spot from Amazon, so I went for it. I wasn’t sure if I should get the Echo Show 5 or 8 to use as a replacement alarm clock and radio in the bedroom. I went with the Echo Show 8 and I am so happy with the purchase. I was nervous that it might be too big or too loud. The size is perfect and it sits on a night stand with a lamp next to the bed. The sound is amazing!!! The bass is also incredible! Best part is at night I don’t like the radio too loud and the Echo Show 8 has the perfect low sound too. The camera shut off feature is key. The dimming feature works great so the light doesn’t bother you while sleeping. I highly recommend the Echo Show 8 and don’t be afraid that it’s too much for a bedroom. You’ll be able to have a dance party during the day and listen to soothing music as you sleep at night.

366,amandar,"Brilliant design suggestions, IF I do say so myself... 12+","  I've noticed some features that seem to be missing. Feel free to pay me a shiny nickel for each you implement, Commander Bezos.1) BRIGHTness should be controllable with voice. This is SUCH a NO-BRAINER!2) Why does the ""command received"" beep play at full volume when I whisper to it? Confirmation beeps should be in very, very soft volume -- LIKE A whisper. DUH! If it's dark in the room and I whisper, NO beep should sound. Maybe show a  dark background with a dim red check mark to not kill my night vision?3) Why does the interface get confused / stuck and require a screen touch when I am watching Prime Video and then ask for, say, the temperature. I don't want to have to touch the screen.4) I want to fall asleep to a prime video movie, there should be a sleep timer JUST LIKE I CAN SET FOR MUSIC.5) When listening to music and I ask for a sleep timer to be set, WHY does it scream ""OKAY I'LL STOP PLAYING..."" when I am OBVIOUSLY going to sleep? If it's not intended for sleep, call it an OFF TIMER instead?6) I want it to learn my habits. If I say SET VOLUME 2; PLAY SMOOTH JAZZ; SET SLEEP TIMER FOR 20 MINUTES every night, shouldn't it suggest it noticed the pattern after the third time and ask if I want to create a recurring routine -- and if I say YES (PLEASE), it should ask me the keyword to activate it?!? I'd choose ""SLUMBER"" and expect no confirmation sound of any kind when I request it.7) Please add JARVIS as an available wake word!  Tony Stark's assistant has the correct name! So fun.8) When I say CANCEL, I should never, ever hear a beep or ""CANCELLING"". Never. Ever. Never ever. Maybe a setting call ""ENABLE SILENT CANCELLING"" is in order.9) There should be a ROOM LIGHT function that turns on the screen with a bright light so that we can see to get into bed, read buttons on a remote, etc. A ROOM LIGHT TIMEOUT should be configurable, as should the color. Or put an up-firing LED on the top, aimed away from the screen.10) WHY does a prime video RESUME after I request THE TIME BUT NOT when I ask the TEMPERATURE?11) Should there be a TEMPERATURE ONLY request? see 3) above12) Should there be a LET ME KNOW IF IT STARTS RAINING alert that is configurable for time of day window and repeat every day?If there are ways to accomplish what I have suggested above, WHY HASN'T the box suggesting them to me?RESPECT THE WHISPER!RESPECT THE WHISPER with the ambient light level!RESPECT THE WHISPER!",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2020"
367,KJ,Was a bit disappointing- Edited,"  EDIT - Amazon fixed this issue.  I can now see who is at my door.I used to have a Sony box like this that was a really great tool.  Sony, unfortunately, discontinued it.  The Alexa box is okay as a clock and music player just like the echo.  I just expected it to work from the screen more.  I wanted to use it for my Ring doorbell mostly because I work at home.  I wanted it to give me a view of who was there. It tells me there is someone there, but I have to hit buttons to see the screen.  Not any more helpful than the phone app.  Everything that is set up has to be done from the Alexa phone app.  In music, you can't just decide you want to listen to a shuffled list.  You can't just select what you want on the screen unless you have already played it.  You can't select between Pandora and amazon music for instance without remembering exactly what you called the Pandora station.  It doesn't find bands and the genre's are limited.  The news briefing is nice.  I have not tried to use the video yet.  The home controls are a bit buried.  I would love to see those from the home screen.  Basically it is a really fancy clock radio.

368,Gregg Smith,Bought it for my mom and it is perfect,"  We bought this for my elderly mom as a Christmas present.  We live quite a ways from her and with the virus keeping her home bound and our visits very limited, it has brought us together, visiting on the video calls and showing her things we have been doing in our home, our pets, views of the lake from our home, etc.  Alexa offers her things to view, listen to, weather reports, recipes, games, stories, etc.  We recently combined it with a Blink camera to watch her front door.  She asks Alexa to show her the Front Door and she can see who is there.  It brings us so much fun and happiness to get to see my mom and vice versa.  It was not easy to set up.  It is interesting, there are directions telling you WHAT to do, but not HOW to do the WHAT.  I found that extremely frustrating and probably said a lot of words my mom isn't used to hear me say.

369,Caroline Haley,Incessant self-promotion that can't be turned off,"  Amazon controls what you see on your Echo screen. For years there have been ""tips"" at the bottom of the screen which can't be turned off. Now there is ""Alexa for your day"" which hijacks your entire screen every screen rotation; you can't turn this off either. Even with screen rotation set to ""once"" it will still rotate every time the screen 'wakes up' or you interact with the device.Last year I bought this Echo Show 8 to replace a first generation Echo Show that's been on my Kitchen counter for several years. For years I have also been ignoring the unwanted tips at the bottom of the screen (Try ""Alexa, blah blah blah""). The latest version version of Echo software has added a new full screen slide (Alexa for your day!) to remind you, repeatedly, that you aren't using Alexa enough.'Tips' are fine for people who want to see them. Not being able to turn them off is ridiculous. Hijacking my screen, so that Alexa can advertise itself, is unacceptable. I deactivated this show and went back to my original Show a couple weeks ago.Today 'Alexa for your day' turned up on my old Show as well. I will be removing it from service as well.On the hardware side of things, the microphones on the Echo Show 8 are much less sensitive than the original Echo Show. I frequently had to repeat myself or raise my voice to get the Echo to respond.I liked the larger screen and fuller sound of the Echo Show 8 but the poor microphone response was very frustrating. Not being allowed to control the visual content on MY screen is a deal-breaker.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2021"

371,R. Richardson,"Okay, but not great","  All I wanted was to have a video doorbell and a display that would show when someone was at the door. So I bought a Ring Video Doorbell 3 and an Echo Show 8.Setup was more of a pain than I'd expected. I had to log into Amazon and Ring accounts multiple times to make this work, and enter passwords for both as well as for my Wi-Fi. I realize that I must enter at least the Wi-Fi and Amazon passwords once, but It seems to me Amazon could make this a lot easier. Why do I have to have both accounts? And why does Amazon insist on having so much of my personal information? I'm not happy about that at all.Now that I have both devices working and connected, I find that there are several things the Echo Show does that I'm disappointed with.-- you have to load the Alexa app on your phone to set this up and configure it. I really don't want the Alexa app on my phone; that's why I have the Echo Show.-- while you can turn off most of the alerts and notifications on the Echo Show if you want, you can't get rid of the ""try this"" on Alexa messages. They're tiresome.-- instructions for configuration on the support pages here aren't always clear and easy to follow. If you're looking for how to change certain display features, you have to sort through a lot of stuff that isn't what you're looking for.-- you have the choice of  various slide shows to display when the machine is idle. You can choose your own pictures, or nature shots, or travel photos, etc. But you can't choose more than one.All in all, it's an okay device, but it's flexibility and usability could be much improved.Edit: my original review said that the Echo Show 8 won't display day and date on the home screen. Just minutes after my review was posted, my Echo Show 8 got an update, and now it suddenly does display day and date!  Now, about 5 minutes later, it has reverted to time/temp only.

372,Lynn's Daughter,Lacks functionality with Ring doorbell on motion sensing - button works fine,"  Like most other reviewers, I don't like the so-called helpful screens and messages that Amazon thinks I should receive - even after repeatedly going through my settings to minimize them.  But the biggest problem I have is that this unit, along with my other two Echo Shows and my four Echo Dots all lost the ability to announce when my Ring Doorbell senses motion right after the huge AWS outage on December 7th.  Despite repeated attempts to repair this problem, nothing seems to work like it did flawlessly for almost two years prior to the outage.  I can tells Alexa to ""Show me the front door"" on the three Echo Shows and it works fine, but not the other way around.  The push-button operation of the doorbell works every time on this Echo Show and the Ring Chime Pro, but still fails to communicate with the dots.  And Amazon seems to be pushing the Ring Doorbell 3 as a possible improvement for motion sensing.  Seems somewhat curious timing for this improved version to me!  I need the motion sense alerts when I'm out in my shop.  I've already missed several package deliveries this holiday season.  Terribly frustrating since everything was OK before the outage!!!  Has anyone else experienced similar problems???

373,Doc,"Typical limited ""Alexa"" issues - Limited outdoor use -  Very good music sound.","  After all I've read about how Amazon records everything the owners of these things say for use in improving Alexa's ability to respond to requests/commands, I have to say Amazon has a long ways to go. Ask a simple compound question? Forget it. Other common things that could be quickly looked up on Google? Good luck. Maybe yes, maybe no. Nevertheless, I get enough enjoyment out of these things to have purchased an Echo Show-Second Gen, two Echo Show 5s, and this Echo Show 8. I have to say that the Show 5s put out pretty good sound for their size. But the Echo Show 8 puts out sound much like my full-sized Echo Show Second Gen, which is very good. Good enough to use outdoors for a patio party. BUT WAIT. OUTDOORS? The other day, I was using my Echo Show 8 outdoors, and the sun was shining. It was a pretty cool November Pacific Northwest day, and the sun, at its seasonal low angle, was shining on it. After several minutes, I went indoors briefly, and upon my return outdoors, the Echo Show 8 was quiet. The screen displayed some faint icon that sort of looked like a thermometer. (Find that in the instructions.) I unplugged the device and plugged it back in, and when it fired back up, I got no response and just that mysterious little icon in the middle of the screen that looked like a thermometer. Guessing that meant the display was too warm (from the sunshine), I took it back inside, waited several minutes, and then repowered/reconnected the speaker. It began working just fine, but naturally, Alexa didn't tell me what had gone wrong. Subsequently, I took the Echo Show 8 back outside, plugged it in, and kept it in the shade. No more problems. I could write an article about this thing - a lot of it good, and some about its  nd other Amazon Echo product quirks and shortcomings. But I don't get paid for that, so just let me say that for $65 bucks, this thing is worth it. Just don't pay full price and/or expect unlimited versatility. And you might be happy. I am. Pretty much.

375,OregonMomma,Totally worth it!,"  We finally got better internet in our home and could finally use the echo dots I had gotten over a year ago. When we had slower internet speeds (5Mbps), we couldn’t use any smart device, not just echo devices. We were lucky if we could stream movies uninterrupted. Now that we have good internet, they work amazingly. We have a dot in the bedroom, another in the living room, and our new echo show 8 in the kitchen. Anyways, I happened to see that the Echo Show 8 was on sale for a great price and decided to give it a try. I’m so glad I did. As stated, we have ours in the kitchen and we love it. I can look up recipes when cooking. I can have Netflix going in the background while cooking. We love that we can upload pictures and see them as the screensaver. We listen to music on it A LOT! For just that reason alone, it was totally worth the $89 I paid for it. There are Bluetooth speakers out there that don’t even sound this good and cost more than what I paid. I will say, it is a little heavy on the bass, but that could also be my location of it. It’s on a shelf in a sort of corner cubby. But really, it sounds great. Way better than my echo dots. I also like that I can drop-in (see through the camera) from anywhere outside my home and see what’s going on in my kitchen or check on my dogs using the camera that’s on it. About gave my teenage son a heart attack once dropping in when he was getting snacks and was home alone. That’s worth $89 alone, lol. As far as setting things up and connecting other devices, there is a learning curve and that can be frustrating as far as setting up groups and uploading photos, or dropping in (that was actually pretty easy), but that’s more of an Alexa app and photo app thing, not a device issue. Concerning voice recognition, it does a pretty good job of it. Sometimes it doesn’t pick my voice up and I have to repeat, and other times it picks it up when I’m not talking to it. That’s really a minor thing to me. I also have it connected to quite a few smart bulbs and plugs and it works great with those. Planning on getting some blink cameras soon, as well. There are a lot of complaints about the “Try this” text at the bottom, but I promise you, we don’t even notice it anymore. Don’t worry, if you’re watching Netflix it doesn’t show those pop ups. I gotta tell you,  I’m a fan of the Amazon line of smart devices. I haven’t really had any bad experiences with them and will continue to use them going forward. You have to understand though, having a good internet provider makes a huge difference. At 5Mbps, we couldn’t use our echo devices and it was a real bummer. Now that we have increased the speed, everything works great and I can’t wait to get my next fun and functional smart device. Oh, one last thing, we got the stand to go along with it. LOVE IT!

Here's the thing: my old iPad Air (really old - Gen1 - I keep it mainly to set up 2.4ghz *smart* devices) gives me an overview of all my cameras at once. It's like a tiny little security array. This thing, I tell it to show me a camera, but that's all I can figure out how to do so far, aaaaaannnnd a triangulating little beeee in an Orbi extender that cannot change its wake word and won't mind its business over in the next room keeps telling me that IT can't do cameras (I know - you don't even have a screen and BTW I didn't ask YOU).Anyway, oddly, configuring the old iPad was a breeze. It does everything I want. This thing, not so much. And my old 7 inch kindles connected faster. They both died within a week of each other, though.Bottom line: if the old kindle fires had not died, I would be wishing I had not spent money on this. As it is, I'm not mad, but I wish it did more.

Hookup was easy, the ability to see who is at the door is great and like the ability to know when packages arrive to bring them in. The sound quality is awful. We listen to music instead of watching TV when doing our daily routine. Neither of us have fine tuned ears that can differentiate between expensive speakers and those that are cheaper. However, the volume on this echo goes from loud to very soft without anyone touching the controls.

Love the games like song trivia , word scramble etc. Also reads news  ( great for when cooking & hands aren’t free) . Only downside so far is sometimes it doesn’t register what you say for some commands for Alexa but mostly it’s correct. Not a dealbreaker though cause it’s usually accurate. You can also  leave feedback on Alexa app though cause it record all commands so that’s helpful. you can’t see Apple podcasts screen for latest podcast subscription & I would love to have that added but currently it show that.You have to say the podcast name & it will play the latest by voice recognition. You can go back to earlier episodes by voice which is helpful or by pressing back button.  Overall though I’m loving it cause there’s so many cool functions besides just listening to music.

That's a lot of time wasted only to find that there just doesn't seem to be any way to get two Show 8's working as a stereo pair.

And for me that a no no because any little light I see I can't sleep. There's no way of dimming it or nothing and it's always on at all times it never sleeps. Over all it's great for the price but still needs a lot of programming. And patience which I dont have so now it just sits unplugged on the dresser. Plus the sound it sounds muffled like if there was something covering the speakers.

387,Countryboy0211,Like it more than I thought I would.,"  Works great by itself as an Alexa device or as a tool integrated into a smart home with security cameras.With Ring you can see who is at the door and have a conversation without going to the door. With other security devices you have the ability to ""show"" the state or the video feed.I also think it's neat that you can show recipes while you are baking step by step. You can also pull up videos including YouTube. You can video chat. When you listen to Amazon music you can so lyrics when they are available and album art.For those nervous about the camera you can turn it off and it has a slide cover so you don't need to worry about it.All in all I'm pretty impressed with this device. I like it way more then I thought I would. They put a lot of thought into it. I recommend it if you utilize Amazon voice service.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2020"
388,Kwebbster,echo show,"  This was a gift.  Depends on what you want from it.  I don't like having to memorize the ""key"" word in order for me to see ""stream"", or distinction between ""video"" and streaming.  I had to look on amazon site and figure out what ""skills"" were. My impression is that this is NOT an intuitive device.  However, if you are into that then it will work fine.  I would prefer a menu already within the choices to guide me easily to what function I would like to play.  The other item of having people call and be seen on the device is not optimal in that I have to ask them to download the amazon app.  Maybe I don't understand how all the parts work and there is a simple explanation, BUT do i really have or want to take the time vs working with something more intuitive.If you want to watch Netflix or Hulu - it can do that but so can a ipad or portable device. Not sure of what niche this has compared to tablet except you have to learn what ""skills"" or vocab will trigger the response you want. If you don't already own a tablet it might be a choice.  If you are thinking it is a gift for an older adult who isn't comfortable with electronic devices, this may not be a good fit.  They may learn 1 - 2 functions and not every utilitze anything else.  If that is all they want, then ok but a tablet might work easier.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2021"
389,WorthMoreDead,Nifty tech. Alexa works with some coaxing.,"  Great product. Works great as a monitor for ring doorbells and can arm or disarm ring security systems. The speaker is good for music and is clear sounding even at hi volume levels. And in a pinch can be used via a patch cable as a external speaker for a smart tv. Haven't played with it much. Setup is easy. Plug it in, give it access to your home internet Wi-Fi and link your Amazon account and your off to the races. It has Bluetooth and can be used as a hands free speaker.Overall a great product, there's a little learning process to get the most out of this product.If I had a gripe its about the base, Its not magnetic so you have to align a bar on the base to the hole on the bottom of the device. No locking it just sits there, a locking tab, button or strong magnet to lock base to device would be helpful.This is a lot better than the echo dot I have. It quit connecting to my network, reset network router and device multiple times just won't connect. Let's hope the new dot with clock works.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2021"
390,ImNoNoob,"One major flaw, otherwise good","  (As of 12-25-2019)  I just received and installed the Echo Show 8 several days ago. It soon upgraded itself to the latest software. I had read many Show reviews, including complaints about the constant ""Things to Try"" notices on the screen. Also read a couple reviews that claimed to instruct how to turn this ""feature"" off.So, after getting the Show 8 going, there were the never-ending things to try on the screen. So I tried the steps others had earlier listed. NONE work now at this time.  Over several hours I tried everything, no joy.So I got Amazon Help online and started the Chat (with ""Tech""). After 10-15 minutes of delay and ""Thanks for waiting"" and ""Let me check on that"", etc., the expert said the actual tech folks said that at present there is NO WAY to turn that off. But they would surely take my ""suggestion"" into account for future upgrades. UNBELIEVABLE!If this will not irritate you, the Show 8 is otherwise a very powerful tech addition to your Echo house (I have 9 other Echo devices at home).IF they do allow the ""Things to Try"" feature to be removed in the future I will update this...1/1/20 Indeed if you turn on ""Do Not Disturb"" it will no longer display the maddening ""Things to Try"", although if the device is doing something for you TTT will activate during that time. Device is slow to shift gears but after a few seconds it will return to the screen with only the clock and a moon icon. If you have personal pictures as a background, they WILL continue under DND.  Now a great device, lol...UPDATE: OK, you can now do away with ""Things to Try"". However, over time I found another flaw. The Show 8 does not understand me as it should.At times I have to repeat commands, at times it spouts garbage from the web instead of responding to a command. My main Echo has no such problem, and I use the same commands and tone of voice. Frustrating...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2019"
391,Dominic Wu,Could be so much better,"  I can't help feeling my Echo Show could be so much better. I got it so I could access recipes and follow them in the kitchen. I will often research recipes and decide on a few for use during the upcoming week. I can't sync browser use so I ended up typing in the website several times when following a recipe tonight. The screensaver came on if I didn't access the browser for a few minutes; the website dissapeared after the browser went back to home when I left for a while (allowing meat to marinate a few hours and then coming back to finish the recipe). If the echo had more settings I could control time before screensaver appears, among other things. Why can't I sync my phone for more than just music? Why isn't Google Chrome one of the available browsers? Syncing with my Google account would be amazing. Why can't I customize the Home screen to make it more useable by adding shortcuts to my favorite uses?

392,LadyHunt,Why is Alexa's voice recognition noticeably worse than Google's?,"  The screen is nice and large and the sound is good. A solid update from my first generation Echo Show.I've come to grips with the fact that Kindle devices aren't as good as iPads because you pay a third of the price. But why is the voice recognition of the Echo devices not as good as Google Nest devices at the same price point? I use both families of devices in my home with a preference for Amazon's. Every day I find myself literally yelling at Alexa because it misunderstood something I said. I thought maybe it was just the older generation Echo Dots but even both my new Echo Show 5 and Echo Show 8 exhibit this same problem. The problem most frequently comes up with routines (e.g., ""Alexa, send the kids to bed"") and news stories (e.g., ""Alexa, what's the Hot Dog Day story?"").The Echo, Echo Dot and Echo Show devices are generally good and have become part of my everyday routine, but the frustration that comes from hit-or-miss voice recognition (probably the device's biggest selling point) is enough to detract from the overall experience.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2020"

394,Person,Multi-functional - high quality - easy to use,"  Very pleased with overall quality of the device. Design is simple and unobstrusive, and there are just a few button controls and cable connections. Best for those with Amazon Prime who use its other services and devices. We are using it in the kitchen primarily for quick access to the front door Ring doorbell camera, but we will also be using it to access Amazon prime video, music and photo services. Music quality played through speakers is very good. Alexa voice command is very responsive but may not always respond as expected. Setup through the Alexa phone app can be frustrating. Part of the problem is that the quick start manual included with device lacks sufficient detail and there is no full user manual available online. There are also no detailed instructions for connecting with non-Amazon services with which the device is supposed to be compatible. Amazon customer support phone line is very helpful if you run into trouble, but I would prefer to be able to look up the answers I need on my own.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2020"

396,Amazon Customer,Started good.  Steadily getting worse for the last two years.,"  Update 01/26/2022:  The performance continues to decline.  They're worse at recognizing my voice than they were when I bought them, and they CONSTANTLY answer to the TV instead.  Also they are cramming in more advertising on-the-fly, like when you ask for music that's NOT Amazon music, it often goes on to tell you how wonderful Amazon Music is and why you should buy it instead of what you actually asked for.  Finally, the Plex functionality is beautiful when it works - which is about 5% of the time.  I've had it work for weeks at a time, then suddenly not function at all.  It calls up the Plex screen but no music plays.  However, the server says it's sending the music, so I'm guessing it's getting hung up somewhere in Amazon's server zoo.  (Not a server farm, because farm critters WORK, zoo animals just laze about like Amazon servers.)  To say I'm disappointed would be an understatement, and I'm re-weighing the pros-and-cons of going to Google instead, since they now have a comparable device.Oh, and you may notice these ""people"" have now added an advertisement to your shopping list!  SURPRISE!  I swear, if you sit on a park bench for long, some Amazon advertising executive will plaster a sign on your back!  It's beyond ridiculous.  It's pathetic.---ORIG REVIEW: I love the Echo.  I have an 8 and two 5's, and they basically run my house.  But there is a LOT of stuff you have to turn off on the home screen (assuming you don't want it, which I don't!)  I did all that.  So for month, it's been working well, showing my a clock and my nice photos.  Lovely!However, Amazon has recently FORCED another screen on us called ""For Your Day"" which takes over your screen periodically, is ugly as heck, and serves no purpose whatsoever.  I have mine set up to act as clocks with my photos on them, and then this butt-ugly crap pops up and THERE'S NO WAY TO DISABLE IT.  Needless to say, I'm not so happy with it now, and I'm seriously considering dumping the devices and putting in Google Hubs instead.

I'm enjoying it so far however I wish it was more customizable between how the clock is displayed (my #1 purpose for purchasing this was for an all-in-one nightstand clock) to how quickly the information on the screen is transitioned. But what truly has caused me to write my first review so quickly was - for the love of God, Amazon - please turn off the constant ""Try 'Alexa'...."" suggestions. They're horribly distracting. When I viewed Echo Shows in the store I guess I foolishly thought they were in a demo mode for those suggestions to have appeared on the screen constantly. I really just wanted the ability to have a great sounding and great looking yet customizable digital clock on my nightstand.

The time interval in settings does not affect this.  The settings is for ""slide shows"".  Not sure what Echo Show slide shows are.I like the ability to see Netflix and Prime shows.  But only in a pinch.  Screen size and location are not conducive to long time viewing in my opinion.I like to ability to turn off most video messages from Alexa.  And I have turned most of them off.  Annoying.  I hate that I can not turn off the extremely annoying Alexa Try .....  messages across the bottom of the screen.  Despite what some reviewers say these can not be turned off.  I have even written to Jeff Bezos about this at jeff@amazon.com.  I did get a meaningless reply.  Amazon should pay attention to their customers about this issue.  I gave the Echo Show 8 minus one star because of this.The screen orientation of the Echo Shows is fixed. To change the viewing angle you must prop it up with something.  Amazon sells a stand for the Echo Show 8 for $25.  Wow, $25 for a piece of plastic?

I did my research online and sure is a known problem that everyone have that Amazon choose to ignore.  It really defeats the purpose why there's a screen in the first place. Second the clock is tiny on an 8"" screen. Yup it's positioned in the right corner with a small font haha! Who ever programmed this thing need to find another job. Overall I would call this thing an experimental device, a beta version to test in the market with no intention of making it better via firmware or software. Instead Amazon went ahead and released their second generation show 8 and ignoring the people that bought the first generation. I'll never buy another screen version Alexa device.

400,Gloria Brooks,Perfect in every way!!!!!,  Upon arriving the day after ordering I plugged it in and Bluetooth did the rest. It integrates my iPhone apps perfectly and opens my favorite podcast and music without a glitch. The sound is amazing. I am adding an echo speaker to the mix and my security cameras today’s. I tried the option to see the inside of my home from the camera on the Echo show 8 and was able to see my dogs being good while I was away from home. That is a real bonus to view inside the house when away. So far all is above my expectations. Also I accidentally ordered the 8.  My sister has a smaller screen size and thought I ordered that but mine is bigger and I am very pleased this happened. So I would assume the 8 means 8 inch screen and so on. All in all probably the easiest set up on a very useful item I have dealt with so far. I also added my Roku to the echo show so I just ask for any channel on my existing roku and I can watch tv from my Echo Show 8. Love the Apple Music and have 100 % accuracy on song titles and bands. Even when I am not talking super close to it or speaking as clearly as you think I need to.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2020"
401,SDR,Almost perfect,"  These could be better. I have 2 ""8's and a 5"" so obviously I like them. They just come short of really being a home run.The 5"" replaces an alarm clock at the bedside (ya I know, who uses those still?) It can wake you up and tell you about the weather, or go over any tasks you have to do for the day. It is useful unless the person next to you is still sleeping...The 8""s I use for all sorts of stuff. Listening to music, reading lyrics, watching videos, displaying photos, Checking on rooms I am not in (you can drop in on yourself basically) which soumds odd, but I set one up in a detached garage and I can check to see if my 3d printer is going fine or if it birdsnested my job. Plus I can talk to the Wife hands free while goofing around out there.Sure your phone can do pretty much all of these things. Like easily. Which I why I say they could be better.For one, I'd love if I could use the same apps as Fire stick or Fire TV. Then I could spool up stuff from my list and watch, or even pause and continue from other rooms... Alas, these are not features of this device. They should be. Considering the cost and being part of the Amazon ecosystem you'd think it wouldn't be a step in the wrong direction.I do enjoy my music and ability to add to a playlist using amazon music. If I hear something I like i can just ask to have it added to blah playlist and its there. However, I can't seem to add an album to a playlist unless I yank my phone out and use the app. So again, close but not quite.I am a sucker for tech, piloted the original echo back in the day and still have 2 of them. I find their sound/mic fantastic.They pick up wifi signals well and you can set them to do not disturb when you leave a room if you want to make sure it doesn't start talking to the dog.I guess I'm rambling a bit but I am trying to get to a point where I would recommend these to you. If you expect it to magically do something your phobe doesn't. And really, that is all the function you care about, then you can probably pass.However if you have niche uses, for example, I had multiple surgeries and was stuck in bed for a while. I was able to chat with people without having to hold my phone, charge it, etc. If you have kids, yoh can easily drop in from wherever and say Hi. Or even loved ones miles apart can be talking like they are in the same room. The closest a phone gets to that is bluetooth speakers and a tripod. This just does it out of the box.You can view lists, recipes, webpages though I do this less. In some cases it is useful, but I mostly use mine for the camera and media consumption.It is smart enough to recognize multiple users in your household. Each can have their own playlists, skills, shopping lists etc.I say if you are on the fence, to give it a shot. It makes a good gift too if you have someone in mind who is isn't in your home, now days with Covid that's the case with everyone.Plus, if you have any smart home stuff compatible with Alexa, these will work to control it as well.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2021"

403,Average Bob,"Absolutely sensational, highly recommend!","  I use this in my bedroom, right next to my bed. Alexa picks up my voice without fail, but then again it is usually 10 feet max away from me. Another part I love is the camera. It's not just a simple on/off button that keeps you guessing if anyone could be watching, it's also a shutter. Alexa has plenty of skills, way more than I need, and I can play music and watch NBC, tubi, Prime Video, Food Network, Hulu, and Red Bull TV. But be warned: if you want Spotify, you need Premium, which is well worth it. And guess what? I haven't even gotten to the best part: the speaker. This speaker takes the cake! I live in a very large household, and my bedroom is at the very top of the house. When the speaker is only at half volume you can hear it all the way downstairs. WOW! When it's a full volume, it almost feels like you're listening to a concert. Get it right now while it's on sale! I bought it for a song and was not disappointed! 5 stars on everything for this! Highly recommend!Edit 6/26/20: I've had this for over a month now, and everything is working well. Although Alexa does have a couple problems playing songs I ask her to play, I haven't been able to not play a song after numerous attempts.

404,sinewavelife,Great but expensive,"  Pros: user friendly, amazing sound, will be an invaluable addition to our home.Cons: One of my main reasons for getting this was the bundle with the blink mini.  I love the blink mini and the echo show and I love that you can use the echo show to check the camera.  I work and homeschool so I wanted to be able to check on my kids and tell them to stay on task if needed.  What I don't love is that they don't make it clear that you can ONLY view the camera.  The voice feature is only available on the blink app. I just hope they update that feature because it was a selling point for me and I am disappointed. I also don't like that they charge you extra for the stand, you can use it without but if your using it in your kitchen you really want it on a stand to keep it safe and properly adjusted.  Right now mine is propped up with canning lids which makes for an interesting sound when the subwoofer kicks in.  We figured out quickly that you can only stream amazon music one at a time, which stinks, $14/month for music is insane.  The only livestreaming you can do is through hulu, which is expensive.Overall I love this thing, the unit is affordable, but its unfortunate that they make all of the features so expensive on top of the initial cost and the cost of a prime membership.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2020"
405,Geoff,One of the best Amazon devices out there,"  I would like to first start by saying that I am a huge Amazon fan but I'm going to try and keep this review unbiased .To start off this comes very well packaged and is pretty much just like every other Amazon device packaging not flimsy and seems to be made high quality. As for the setup, it is super simple to set up answer a few basic questions and it starts up. The screen is very clear . This product does have weight to it and has one of the best sounding sets of speakers that I have heard in a long time. This does have a software-based equalizer to adjust the low mid and high range. Controlling the device is very simple via voice or via touch, simply say your wake word and then say the command or swipe from right to left and choose a function. I am giving this five stars despite having a few negatives. First negative even though set up is flawless and this appears to be nothing more than a tablet attached to some really high quality speakers and some software you cannot add anything other than skills. Which in my opinion kind of defeats the purpose of having something as amazing as this. I would like to see the ability to utilize and customize screensavers backgrounds whatever and be able to make it my own. There are very limited options for customization. Although this is not a deal-breaker many people including myself would like the ability to select what they want on it such as placing android-based apps. In addition, although the sound is truly phenomenal I would really like to see more control of specific sounds by use of a seven band equalizer instead of just the standard three band, possibly surround sound effects as well. If you have never owned one of these devices before you will be pleased to know that these have fantastic video calling features that can sense low bandwidth and adjust the image quality accordingly I have used this on a hotspot 3g with absolutely no problem getting high def the call quality was pretty decent I did not notice any lag or video degradation while on a high-speed connection as mentioned earlier on 3g video degradation is possible.Watching movies on this is the equivalent of watching movies on a tablet however the sound quality is truly remarkable. Although the paper documentation is limited the voice controls appear to be exactly the same as the fire cube. I have been using this for about 2 weeks now and it is the perfect companion to my other Amazon devices.One thing I forgot to mention was that the camera does have a physical shutter which can be manually opened and manually closed to increase your privacy.As with all echo devices this does have a button to silence the microphone and this does have a volume up and volume down.All of these settings are controlled via the software settings button which is located by swiping from the top to the bottom and from within the Alexa app.As we are in the midst of a pandemic with no hard end in sight I did wind up purchasing five of these devices for Christmas gifts. It is in my opinion one of the best most versatile devices on the market which seamlessly integrates with your prime membership. Even if you choose not to have a prime membership you can use all of the features of this device it costs nothing to operate but you do need to have some form of internet connection wirelessly..Note for people with vision problems. It is recommended by me to avoid purchasing the echo show 5 and purchase a echo show 8 or echo show 10 if you have problems with eyesight or for the elderly as it is a much bigger screen and easier to read.And again I am rating this five stars.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2020"
406,A,I hate that I like this thing.,"  I was one of the pilot customers for the original Echo, and our cylindrical friend continues to work flawlessly to this day. I picked up the Show because it was BOGO and, well, I was curious. The Show 8"" joins two generations of Dots and the OG Echo in the house, and while I am 100% against ""more screens"" I am also 100% pro Show. I love that it can act as a physical remote control for smart home devices so you don't have to blurt out commands in the middle of the night (although Alexa still responds ""ok!"" which is *super* annoying). The audio quality on the Show is actually pretty remarkable which is nice because I use her for music playback frequently. Related, it's kinda nice that when playing music from Amazon you frequently get lyrics, and that's cleared up some household discussions. And, I totally bought into personal photos as the screensaver, so it's fur babies 24x7 at my house. The activity/light sensing works great, and I love the faux sunrise that accompanies morning alarms. I have a couple minor complaints, but I suspect it's stuff I could tune out or modify if I really cared that much. So, clearly, I don't. I'm happy enough that if these end up on super-ultra-sale again I will probably replace the two Dots I have.

It will not always pick up her voice. Still better than WhatsApp.  I like that you can delete voice interactions, and that you can cover the camera.  Alexa wishes me good morning and guards my home. Ask her to play music tell a joke,a story or play a game and she will. Im gonna ask her to make my bank account grow, just to see what happens😉 Alexa gives me a round of applause when i come home.

I like the automatic self adjusting light level feature.  On the down side, the Echo devices are still not mobile.  The device has no battery option and so must be plugged into an outlet in order to work.  I also wish it came with an adjustable stand so the angle of the screen/camera could be easily adjusted for different viewing situations.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2020"
411,Patilu,LOVE IT!,"  My children/grandchildren bought me the new Echo Show 8 HD for my birthday. I have been using an Echo Dot in my kitchen and got them all one at various celebrations. This is a big step-up! I can see my shopping lists by asking, add or delete by touch screen (or by asking Alexa to do it). I can search for recipes (like I usually do on my laptop) right from my Echo Show. If I find one I like, I can ask ""Alexa"" to add the ingredients to my shopping list. We have a granddaughter who is Vegetarian, so I am always looking for recipes she might like. I can make phone calls to others on their phones, but, unless the person I'm calling has an Echo Show, I can't see them when talking. There are so very many things that it can do and I haven't even touched the ""tip of the iceberg."" The grandchildren love it and can play with it when they come. Our granddaughter played ""Who wants to be a Millionaire"" on it yesterday.

412,Eli D. Lee,An Amazing Little Device!,"  I'm finally getting around to writing a review. I bought this for my father who was in the nursing home on palliative care as a way to ""drop in"" on him as (due to distance and family obligations) I wasn't able to visit him more than once/week. Then the pandemic hit and the nursing home went on lockdown. I was no longer allowed to visit him in person BUT this device allowed me to use the drop in feature to connect to his echo and essentially have a video call with him at any time! (Of course I had gotten permission from the nursing home for this device and feature.) I did these ""drop ins"" by using the Amazon Alexa app on my iPhone. I also created a photo album of various pictures of my father and family that had been taken throughout his life using Amazon Photos, and was able to set the album as the home page on his echo, and the photos of the album would cycle through like a slide show on his echo. I figured this would give him some comfort during a time when family wasn't allowed to visit. My father has since passed away. I am just so thankful for this device which allowed me to ""see"" him during his final days. I now have his echo show sitting on my kitchen counter and I am also loving it, and constantly discovering more cool things you can do with it. (This is my first echo show.) Lastly, the photos of my father that I created in the photo album continue to cycle every day on the echo, and it is like a never ending memorial to my father. I couldn't be happier to continue see his smiling face and his memories every day!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 16, 2020"
413,MPass,"Show 8 sound issue. Like Bose, their efforts to achieve bass made speech fuzzy. Needs an equalzer.","  The Echo show 8 has some nice features, but as it... and the cube Amazon TV do not function interchangeably with the other echo products and do not seem to know what the dots in the same room are doing, it is a bit of a mess. Amazon has not made enough names available to name each of these in the same room differently. So If I ask Alexa to switch tv to hdmi 1, the alexa dot says it cannot find a playlist by that name. The Cube tv does not recognize instructions to 'play pandora Everywhere', and it does not have a pin plug to connect audio to my analog house system. If I ask one device 'what is playing', it may not know anything is playing if I told Alexa Show to play pandora everywhere. Echo Show executes tht command, but then cannot execute the command to cancel playing pandora everywhere. EVERY product should integrate as fully as the original echo and the original echo dots, and EVERY echo product needs to have a physical audio pin plug. Also, it is very annoying that the power supply to some is dedicated novel input. All Echo products should have the option for the same  usb power supply.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2020"
414,Beth T,needs some tweaks,"  Really like the Echo Show for the most part, but it definitely needs some tweaks. The main reason I got the show which I upgraded from my 2nd gen Echo Dot was to integrate my Ring video doorbell together. What I wanted was if someone rang the doorbell the Show would automatically pull it up. Well I found out later after buying it that's just not possible. You actually can do that with the Google Nest Hub, seriously Amazon? Get on that! You guys own Ring now, it should have been done long ago. I am able to give it a command, but I'd like it to be automated.The other thing I wanted to do was to use it as a big clock. Looking through the options, you just can't do that. After doing some research online, figured out it can't be done at all (and a lot more people wanted it too). Pretty surprising to me, that's not an option. What I want is the option to set the background to a still image, have a big Clock Face and nothing else on there. Right now I set it so the display is off outside of when I'm using it. Disappointing Amazon again.I had a tissue box right next to it and found it to pick me up worse then my Echo Dots. Talking with a friend I gave it some space and it's def improved (but still not always 100%).If they could add the 2 above features that'd move it to a 5/5 from me. Right now it's a solid 4/5.Update: Changed my review to a 3/5 and ended up trading it in for a new Gen 4 Echo Dot. The mics on it just sucked and you had to repeat yourself 3 times to get it to pick it up. The other features I wanted never came to be. So for now it's back to the dots.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2020"
415,robie88,The sound quality is rich and all encompassing!,"  I purchased this on a whim, for Prime days because there was really nothing else I needed. I upgraded to it from an Echo Dot. I had seen one at a friends house weeks prior but i just knew it was probably going to be too pricey for another gadget in addition to all I already have, but I am really happy I happened upon this nifty device. I took it out of the box, plugged it in and the set up took less than 10 minutes. Once it connected to the Wi-Fi it already had all the settings and information from my previous device. The Alexa phone app immediately recognized the new device and using it was seamless. Besides the large 8"" HD display, the sound quality was the biggest surprise with this device. The sound is comparable to a BOSE system it is rich and the subwoofer makes it sound like a much larger device. I enjoy interacting, playing music and the visuals are crisp and easy to work with.

418,Sylvia,Why do I keep buying these things?,"  I have an echo device in every room, and while the devices themselves are quite nice and well built, Alexa is pretty terrible. It's just not ready for prime time. Its comprehension of every day tasks seems so limited, that it's hard to get it to do what you want. Skills are barely usable, and are so cumbersome, that most of the time you can do what you need on an app on your phone faster than you can get Alexa to do what you want. Support for touch enabled skills for such large screen as the Echo Show 8 is virtually non-existent. It makes you wonder why they need a touchscreen. Things like volume and navigating media are the easiest things to control by voice, yet they have dedicated buttons, and touch controls, but not for much of anything else. It also seems pretty lazy not to scale the clock to fit the size of the larger screen. It's clear to me that we still have a LONG way to go to truly incorporate real smart voice recognition into our lives.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2020"

The U/I is cumbersome and it is really difficult to navigate to the web page for various skills.  But once those skills are added, the video display reveals there is still a lot of work to add visual cues to the voice commands to take advantage of a screen.  This product still seems to work best with my eyes closed, yet the screen is so beautiful I want to look at it but then the U/I lets me down.  For example, the Echos Show 8 is linked to blink cameras but it only responds to motion at one camera and it REFUSES to recognize motion or any activity at all the other cameras.  Their camera apps all respond to motion and send notifications but Echo Show ignores all but the one camera.  The list of odd U/I quirks like that continue.  And we have an echo in the kitchen and the Show in family room but often the echo in the other room responds long before the Show does.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2021"
420,Nacman,Great little device!,"  I do enjoy my new echo show 8, my son & I both have the ""5"" in our bedrooms as well, that pose as alarm clocks. They are convenient for podcasts, music, audio books, news, recipes, photos, movies, and can help to keep you organized by creating and managing various ""to do"" lists, among many, many other things. I love the fact that I can video chat with ease, and that it can call anyone, not only someone who owns an echo device. This feature is especially handy to call yourself to find your phone, when you've misplaced it in your home. I purchased an echo show for my Mom as well, as a safe guard in case she falls or needs help and isn't near her phone. She is 80, and it's a comfort to know she can just hollar ""Alexa, call 911"" , or ""call my daughter"" for help, an alternative to accident alerting devices, and no monthly expense. You can also get online with The echo, although Alexa tells you she doesn't support that feature, she will take you to ""video home"" where you can manually access the internet via youtube or one of the search engines provided using the smart screen.She can't seem to accomodate this command independantly however. As for cons, I wish it had more options for news and movies. She appears to be slightly ""left wing"" oriented, (big surprise, Jeff Bezos). The sound, although good, in my opinion, possesses too much bass and I haven't found a setting that allows me to adjust it. I have a slight hearing impairment and need more treble to hear things clearly. (Maybe Amazon could remedy that in a future update👍😘.) Alexa could also use an AI upgrade. I was very surprised to discover that she isn't nearly as intelligent as the google assistant, there are a ton of questions she can't answer or doesn't recognise. (That said, the echo show, per my research, still gets better reviews than the google hub.) All in all, I'm pleased with my Amazon echos but for those of you looking for a little companionship from your electronic assistant, just know there is definitely some room for improvement 😉.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2021"

I have an Echo Show 5, and an Echo Dot (Gen 3), as well, in other rooms at the house.  They are all useful, but the Echo Show 8 (which I have in the bedroom) is the best of the lot, if you can catch a good sale.  I've used it daily for nearly 3 months.  The screen is certainly adequate (the 10 has the largest screen, but it is more than I need and a bit too pricey for me).  While the 8 does many of the same things as the 5, it has a much better set of speakers (as well as a bigger screen), so if you want your devise to play some music as you settle in at the end of the day, for example, or to help you drift off to sleep, the sound reproduction of the 8 fills the bill nicely.  As with the 5, you can shut off the camera and microphone at will if you're concerned about privacy at any time.  I'm glad I bought it, and I can't say that about everything I've bought in my life.  I'd give the 8 some solid consideration if you're looking for an Alexa-based product.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2021"
425,Glory ,Speaker quality is outstanding!,"  I bought the Echo Show 8 to use with 2 security cameras I bought on Amazon last week. I'm an older guy and so I'm not up on - nor do I particularly need - a lot of the tricks Alexa and the Echo Show 8 can do. However, I love classical music. We already had a Bose Wave radio/CD player. Depending on the recording, the tone on the Bose can be very impressive. However, I have to say, I discovered that Alexa could play classical music from my favorite public radio station. Let me be clear: THE TONE QUALITY IS OUTSTANDING!! All the lowest bass notes are deep and rich. You can hear a guitarist moving his/her hands over the frets of the guitar. Very clear. Oh, and Alexa does show me the view from my security cameras, but I don't know how to do much more with the Echo Show 8. Then, again, I've only had it for 1 day, so I'm sure I will find and use other skills.People complained in other reviews that you can't shut off the constant ""Try Alexa"" content. I've managed to solve it by simply saying, ""Alexa, go to the home screen."" And even though it displays the most beautiful art on my home screen, the classical music continues to play until I tell Alexa to shut off the music.

As an example I selected photos in Alexa App for the wallpaper.  It keeps telling me I have to set up the app even though I did that long ago and my old Show is able to recognize the app and load the requested photos.A bigger issue though is that twice in the last 9 days the new one has completely stopped streaming.  When you issue a command to stream anything, it repeats the command like it always has but then does nothing but go back to the home screen.

427,AzDayton,Could use improvement but still pretty handy,"  My sister bought our family this as well as one for herself and one for our Dad so we can all video chat. Since it has other capabilities I gave it 5 stars. I’m new to using Alexa and personally I like it, it’s nice to ask a question and get answers rather than search on the internet myself. So my review will be broken down in certain sections based on what I use this for: The unit itself, Alexa, Amazon services like audible and Amazon prime features, and the video chat.The Echo unit: it’s maybe the size of a smaller tablet, a little awkward shaped and I will probably look for a stand for it. When video chatting we had to prop something behind it to tilt it downward because the screen kind of faces upward. The device has to always be plugged in so you can’t carry it room to room without unplugging and plugging it back in. It does need a WiFi connection so if you’re connection is slow it will affect live video, but didn’t seem to affect other content like playing movies, books, or music.Alexa: Again, it’s a very handy service. I have an iPhone and a Mac and I use Siri and I think Alexa answered given by Alexa whereas Siri says I found this for you on the web and forces you to read it yourself.Amazon services like audible and Amazon prime features: Unless there’s a way to do this and I just haven’t discovered it yet, I couldn’t find a way to actually view my audible titles or view Amazon Prime songs or movies. It seemed I had to know specifically the name of the title and then Alexa would play it. So that feature would be nice to have. But Alexa does well at pausing, turning the volume up and down, and playing media. We watched a movie from Amazon prime and although the screen is small, it was cool to watch in the kitchen. Lol I’ll move the unit to our bedroom at night and have Alexa play thunderstorm music or meditation music.Video chat: Since this was the primary reason we were going to use these units, it was disappointing. Mind you, it may have had to do with our own internet connection. We live in a rural area and sometimes our signal isn’t the greatest. But during a video chat it was like watching a movie where the words didn’t stay in sync with the lips. There was a lot of freezing in the video and obvious delay where it seemed like live satellite streaming, as if there is a maybe two second pause - for instance I say something and about two seconds later it will process it and send it. That might be normal but it’s just slower than FaceTime.Overall I feel it is worth the money. Hopefully Amazon will improve it’s capabilities in the future but right now it’s still pretty cool to use.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2020"
428,thepreservative,Lacks Basic Customization,"  After spending 2 hours in chat with Amazon support, the issue still wasn't resolved. The Show 8 was displaying content I told it not to. For example, there are toggle options for Trending Topics, News, Popular Recipes, and Covid Updates. I turned all of these off and they still displayed in the screen rotation. Performed a factory reset, unplugged the device, etc. All these items still displayed in the rotation.As if that wasn't bad enough, you can't pick the topics you wish to see in trending topics (our family has absolutely no interest in MLB, NBA, NFL, or other sports content). You can't pick preferred News sources. This means that while I would love to see 90% local news topics, you can't. Amazon's answer to this is that the unit sits in a public space, so it displays content for a wide audience. The problem with that response is simple. Not everyone in the US (or a cross section of that demographic) is looking at my Echo Show. My friend and my family are. Customization of content is critical to making this device worth the purchase.As far as integration, it works just as well as the other Alexa devices we have in the home. Voice recognition is a little off, but not terrible. It does integrate with the Ring doorbell system, which is nice to be able to view the front door, but not worth it if that is your only reason for getting it.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2021"
429,joth,purchased for Ring doorbell cam; had to investigate how to set that up,"  I bought the Echo Show 8 for myself through Amazon.Upon initial setup, I had trouble connecting the device to my Amazon account. No matter what I did it wouldn’t accept my Amazon username and password, which I knew were correct. It just displayed a message that it couldn’t register my device and prompted me in circles wanting me to sign in to Amazon again and again. Very frustrating.I learned through a web search that this is a common problem with the Echo 8, especially when it’s been gifted to someone and the receipient is trying to set it up. Amazon is aware of the issue. I saw a lot of people on a discussion board complaining and going back and forth with tips and tricks—all of which I did and none worked—until I saw a couple of people say they just called Amazon support and had the customer service person set up the device on their end.Now, calling any customer support is always my very last option so I tried a few more of the tips and tricks posted to the discussion board and when nothing worked I did finally call. It was late at night so I didn’t have to wait very long and the person was really nice and set up my device on his end. It only took a few minutes and that worked perfectly.If you get the message that Echo doesn’t recognize your Amazon username or password, don’t waste your time trying to figure it out and getting frustrated, just call Amazon customer service. It’s easy.Whenever I get any device I immediately set up all my privacy options and preferences, which I could do pretty quickly thanks to having watched a YouTube video earlier of someone unboxing his Echo and walking  through the settings and features. It was helpful to watch that video so you may want to find one to review.The ability to choose what content to show on the Home page is nice. Why the designers didn’t think that people would want the date displayed on the homepage mystifies me. It shows time and local temperature but there’s no option to display a day of the week or date. Weird. I saw online that many folks feel the same way and have made Amazon aware, so maybe it’ll happen down the road.I especially like that I can turn off the microphone and shutter the camera. I don’t use voice commands often and I don’t like to think I’m being listened to, so my mic is off most of the time. When I do use it, there’s been good voice recognition.I bought this specifically to keep in my kitchen to use with the Ring doorbell so that I could see who’s on the porch when someone rings or when there’s motion detected.I was SO disappointed that when I connected my Echo and Ring accounts that when there was motion on the porch Echo would only announce that there was motion but didn’t show a live view. Having live view was the whole reason I purchased this! I looked through all the settings for Echo and Ring but no luck. I considered returning it.But then...I did a web search for how to show Ring doorbell video on Echo and someone posted a solution on the Ring discussion board! Now when there’s motion or a doorbell ring, my Echo automatically shows a live feed. To do this, you set a Routine for Alexa. Here’s how:1. Use the Alexa app (not Echo, but the Alexa app on your phone)2. Routines3. Enter routine name4. When this happens5. Smart home6. Front door7. Enter: when front door detects morion8. Anytime (keep this selected)9. Add action10. Alexa says > Customize11. Enter response: show the front door12. From > Choose device13. Choose your Echo ShowIt works! I’m happy.I notice that the device can be slow pulling up things—Ring video, news stories, even settings. Some or all of that could be my wifi. I also feel like the touch screen isn’t as responsive as it should be. I always have to swipe multiple times to bring down the settings screen or to display a different screen and that’s been bugging me.I haven’t yet tried watching any Netflix or Hulu. I did connect with Amazon Music which was fun; I like that the screen shows song lyrics as a song plays, if they’re available. The speaker sound is alright but not great. They sound muffled to me, but I didn’t buy this for music anyway. There are equalizer settings for the speakers in the Alexa app, so I could fiddle around with that. It’s more than sufficient for tinkering around in the kitchen.Looking forward to displaying recipes on this instead of squinting at my phone while I cook.I also bought a magnetic swivel-and-tilt base so I can position the Echo at the different angles. I wasn’t positive that I’d want this gadget but turns out I’m really  glad I got it.Overall, I’m content with the Echo Show 8 so far. I still have a lot to learn about what it can do so I hope it continues to serve me well.=======UPDATEI see that the Home Screen *can* show the date but only when I turn off the overhead lights and Echo dims itself.

It does that very well but it is the “Try, ‘Alexa ----’ “  feature that some people find annoying that I like so much that I purchased a second device.The screen changes with different news items or informational comments and across the bottom of the screen a tag line shows the exact phrasing to use if one wants to know more.  This helps to avoid frustration when struggling to phrase a question or command that Alexa will immediately understand.  The “Try,’ Alexa ----’ ” is also a great prompt for those who are just getting used to AI and not quite sure of how to use it or what to say.I have Alexa Echo audio devices in every room along with the other leading AI assistant.  I find that I can avoid frustration when one of the AI assistants fails to understand me, or can not help me with that yet, to be able to ask the other and usually get a response.Now that displays are becoming the norm I decided to trade up.

431,parkplace,Disappointment compared to the Echo Show 5,"  My Echo Show 8 arrived today.  I was expecting it to be a larger version of the Echo Show 5.  Not so.  You can see the time on the Echo Show 5 from 20 feet away.  This model doesn’t have a large centered clock and  it doesn’t give you the date anywhere.  I suppose I could shout at Alexa from across  the room to ask for the time and date for but it is not worth the breathe when you could otherwise just glance at it.  This is like a large size down grade.  I may return it unless I get a response from someone at Amazon telling me there is going to be a quick fix for this soon.After giving this a negative review, I received a call from Amazon Customer Service.  While I may not be in love with my Echo Show 8, I really love Amazon and their customer service.  The Echo 8 is growing on me.  I will not be returning it.

432,CB,Almost Perfect,"  I wanted to spend some time with this product before writing a review. In the world of smart screens, you pretty much have to choose between Amazon and Google and since I already have several Echo speakers, I decided to go with the Echo Show 8. This product has some great features but could be so much better if Amazon would listen to their users. I've listed some pros and cons below. Here's hoping Amazon makes a couple tweaks to make this the number 1 smart screen on the market!Pros:- Excellent sound quality. This speaker sounds amazing. We used to have an Echo and Echo Dot in our large kitchen but the Show has replaced them both- Home screen customization. You have a lot of control over what will display when the screen is idling which is nice- The physical camera cover is a really nice touch. Great feature that adds piece of mind- Timer functionality is really cool. Since we're used to using smart speakers only, seeing the timer on the screen is a really nice touch and there's a really neat animation for the final few seconds- Smart Home Control works really well. It quickly pulled up all of my devices and works very well with both voice and touch screen controlCons- The biggest complaint I see all the time is one of my biggest as well: ""Try, Alexa..."". Not only is this feature an eye sore but if you have a Show, you probably have other Amazon speakers too. This should at least be optional because it's very distracting and ruins the look of the device- Spotify control feels purposefully poor. I know Amazon Music competes directly with Spotify but to purposefully make Alexa dumber with Spotify is not a great move for customer satisfaction. I never had issues when Amazon Music was my primary music service but with Spotify, I consistently have to use my phone to actually get what I want playing on the Show- I was super excited to use this for recipes but unless you use the All Recipes skill, it just doesn't work. I found a recipe online and opened it on Firefox on the Echo Show but any time I tried to play music as well, it would close Firefox. I really don't understand why Firefox can't be open while music is playing. Seems like an easy fixOverall, I'm really happy with this purchase. Most of my gripes could easily be fixed with a software update so I really hope Amazon can use some of this feedback",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2020"
433,Trillium,Great  gadget///except for what I bought it (them) for,"  I am 73 and live in western NYS.  My daughter lives in Delaware. I bought Echo Show 8's for each of us.  I hoped we would be able to keep in contact especially during this pandemic.  We had 'Zoom'ed before, with other members of the family..but her picture was always blurry. Echo 8 to the rescue. It came quickly, set-up was quick and easy...but try as we might, we could not do video calls.  She contacted a tech at Amazon who was great, but after over an hour, could not help us out. The tech emailed my daughter a couple of days later as she had promised..but alas the ' honeymoon was over as far as my daughter and the Show..and she asked me if she could return it (it had been a gift). She did return hers.  I use mine by my sewing area to watch Prime videos. The picture is great. I do notice that the sound is perfect for music, but for videos, I could stand a little more volume.  I have since done a 'drop in' with a friend locally and it worked well.  Just missing my daughter.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2020"
434,Trillium,Good for my purpose,"  So for what we have the product for, video calls for the folks during these Rona infested times, it’s not bad at all the 8in screen is bright and colorful and you can adjust the volume both sending and receiving audio.  Note: And here is why I give it 3 stars and not 5, 1:  it needs an stand, if you doNot have a stand it leans back to rest on its backside and causes the camera to point up in the air, this can be solved by putting a book or something under it but it is still annoying.  2: You need another device with the Alexa app or a PC to set it up for voice calls.  Once it’s setup you no longer need the other device but It cannot be setup standalone.  3:  For the money you can buy a very nice Amazon fire tablet 7.7 in that has full tablet capability and the 10 dollars you save you can buy a decent folding case that acts as a stand on Amazon.Now for the good:  1: Awesome quality video and audio.  It is a killer audio device that syncs up really well if you have an Amazon music account.  It can do Netflix.  Not that you would watch it on there if you have any other device that can stream Netflix to a TV but it can do it.  It syncs up really easily with other Alexa devices.  Video calls are smooth and the audio and video sync up really well.  My folks live in a rural area and their internet is only 60mbs down and it communicates flawlessly at that speed but I don’t know if I would try it any slower especially if you have other devices.  The price.  For 80 bucks it is a great Bluetooth speaker, video phone, Alexa device that offers great control.  I also really like the fact it always displays the time, date and weather.In the end it meets my needs flawlessly, which is a videophone for my 67 year old folks to see and interact with the family.  My biggest hang up is the fact that you can get a really nice Amazon tablet for less that does more.  It must always be plugged in so do not mistake it for a tablet.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2021"
435,Zachary E,Love it and did think I would like it.,  Received as a gift and thought it was just one more tech item that would sooner or later gather dust.  Not at all..It is in the kitchen and use it not only for video phone calls but for a lot of other stuff. So simple to use that my non tech spouse uses it and listens to it first thing in the morning.  I have had Alexa on my tv for some time but hardly used it.  This show is great for many things.  In calling up recipes quicker than my phone  and converting quantities. That is just one example and I know it can be done on other devices but not as easy with visual.With the pandemic it is a lot easier for video phone calls.  I have android while my son has apple.  That meant we could not use face time and skype was a little cumbersome.  There are other options but all meant a learning curve.  No learning curve for this.  Also downloaded phone app so it in intergrated with other things.  I say when it goes on sale buy it.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2021"
436,jmduvi,limited documentation and inconsistent voice activation lead to frustration with this product,  The Alexa voice activation was inconsistent and required the end user to set up and document what verbal constructs actually work to achieve the goal. The program should act to recognize when the user is trying to  achieve some outcome and when it is finally reached identify the verbal sequence and relate it to the many attempts used before success and recognize these when they occur again. Now  a long process of learning what phrases in what gramatical order and  using which descriptors is required in all but the simplest of requests. Documentation is limited and aside from purchasing books written by authors who have puzzeled out the supposed manual of operation there is sparse and incomplete online content provided.

437,Tango's product reviews,Peace of mind.,"  So I bought this so I can check in on my terminally ill, veteran Dad. He’s also hard of hearing and not great with electronics. So I needed something as user friendly as possible and that he can see my face to help him understand me by reading my lips.After set up it was working great. Two months in, the video chat stopped working. So I went over to his house and sure enough the camera wouldn’t work no matter what I did. He could see me on his screen, but I couldn’t see him. Also, he could only call me like he was on a cell phone. We checked the camera on and off enabling on the device and it was switched to on.So I went to Amazon to check how long the device is returnable or to find trouble shooting information. I ended up finding that they have a customer service chat option. So within a minute I was live chatting customer service. The customer service guy had me unplug / power off / cycle the device and then the camera started working again. ( I should’ve thought of that .... ) Then I needed to figure out why I could video chat him by dropping in on his device, but he couldn’t seem to video call me. Turns out he just needed to ask “Alexa Video Call so and so” to make it work, now that the camera was working again. ( I think maybe he was just telling it to “call me” instead of “video call” ) So thank you customer service for helping me trouble shoot. This stressed out mom needs to be able to see that her Dad is still breathing.I also love that in the Alexa app, I can share pictures to his device. So every once in awhile I send him new pictures of my family that cycle through his Home Screen. It really helps his emotional state.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2020"

They don't have a lot of friends and don't go out much. After COVID-19 I made a conscience effort to reduce the number of times I visit them, which meant they became even more isolated than normal. This gizmo has made it possible to virtually visit with my parents on a daily basis. I can lay eyes on them and make sure they're doing well.

439,Jojo,I really love the Echo Show 8,"  Having read previous reviews, the first thing I did after connecting with my network was to turn off the camera.  The second was to go to Settings and turn off all the scrolling suggestions that I didn't want to be seeing.  I chose Art for my wallpaper and enjoy seeing the various paintings that display.I also listen to a lot of music and find the sound quality better on the Echo Show than on any of the other Echos and Echo Dots I have owned.  In fact, partly b/c of that I traded in one of my Echos for a second Echo Show 8.There are a couple of suggestions that I wish I could make to Amazon's engineers.  While I'm sure that there are many users who like to see song info and lyrics on their screen while listening, I'm not one of them.  I wish there were some place in settings to change that default to immediately return to my home screen.  As it is, every time I start a new radio station or album, I have to say ""Alexa, home"" to get the display back to my home screen.  A small thing but an annoyance.But overall, if you want an Echo to replace a desk clock or a bedside clock radio, I think the Echo Show 8 is an excellent choice.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2020"

I have set this up as a child device and reset to factory settings three times to set up as an adult device and I cannot for the life of me figure out how to do basic things. I consider myself mostly tech savvy, but I cannot get Alexa to do a video call, find the right contacts or even pull up my ring doorbell. She answers simple questions, shows me the weather and can set a timer — big whoop. I’ve had this for a week and I am not impressed with this device whatsoever, do not see the hoorah or hype about it.

Her sister got a smaller 'Show' and placed it in her kitchen so she could look up recipes and do other Alexa related things. So, we got this Show 8. We still haven't figured out how to do the video calls. But, we are really enjoying all of the other benefits of this device. Since it works with Ring, we can view all of our security cameras with it. And, we can still do all of the other things that we did with the Echo+.

I like to play my music often and, well, loudly at times, for which the 8 is perfect.  I can hear it all over the house and it sounds like a decent stereo system.  A true music person would laugh at me for that, but I'm not that picky as long as it isn't scratchy or sounding strained, and the 8 carries sound well, in my opinion.  It works well for reading books aloud while I'm folding laundry or cleaning the kitchen as well.  I like that I can play soft music while working on my post-graduate degree and tell it to skip when a particular song comes on that may interfere with my flow.I like some of the games for the kids, the screen that dims at night, and the weather briefing in the morning, too.

Maybe, but unfortunately, support for YouTube on this device is almost entirely absent.You can technically watch videos on YouTube on the show, but not by speaking to alexa like you do on all other Amazon devices; you need to physically push buttons on the screen to choose what to play. They already do voice commands for YouTube well on the FireTV, so I don't understand how those is such a big miss on the show.Without that function, the screen doesn't really serve a purpose for me, might as well have kept the old dot I had instead of upgrading to this.To its credit, the sound is good; better than I expected, but still underwhelming. Additional functionality and integrations are similarly lack luster.Basically, unless you want this to be able to drop in on friends and family, you're better off with a dot, or the Echo if you want better sound quality.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2021"

448,GMays,"Good device, flawed software by Amazon","  The Echo Show 8 is a good piece of hardware marred by a software design that makes you scratch your head, largely because the numerous requests and feedback from users of the larger Show is largely ignored in this implementation.The display is great, the built in pictures are also great, and the scrolling weather, news and other functions work well.The issues.1. There is no way to have a larger clock in ""standard"" mode.  It's a small little clock in the corner, and even if you turn off all the info scrolling options like news, weather, etc. It stays this small little clock with a bunch of empty screen space. Do not disturb allows for a larger clock, but is a poor implementation of allowing it as it literally shuts everything else off.2. Do not disturb in the menu says it turns the screen off, but actually leaves the screen on and just gives you a larger clock.  It should turn the screen off as stated and there should be a separate mode for displaying a larger clock.3. Night mode is still WAY too bright and there's no way to adjust it or dim it down. Nor any option to configure it so that night mode is just a clock, no picture.Now, if this was a first try, these things would be forgivable as they worked through what the end user wanted.  The issue?  The Google Home Hub has been out for over a year and literally has NONE of these issues as they got all of these wrongs right.  Want a full screen clock.  Check.  Want a proper dnd mode? Check. A night time mode that properly dims the display?

Also when I pause a video for a few minutes, I come back only to find it’s stopped whatever I was watching and gone back to the main screen.

I mainly bought these for voice control of my home automation setup but also the timer features are useful for cooking.But I have two major complaints...First, I've got the Show 8 in one room and the Show 5 in another.  And within the last few months, unless I'm within a few feet of the Show 8, the Show 5 in the other room responds.  Almost.  Every.  Time.

But I guess there's been enough said about that on other posts...UPDATE:Reducing from 3 to 2 stars as didn't realize I hadn't posted 2 stars first time.More context on my first issue (wrong device responding to voice commands), I know that the Show 5 and Show 8 are aware of each other as, for example, when I'm in the same room as the Show 8 and trying to control a timer, the Show 5 (in the other room) is the one that responds and is able to control the timer on the Show 8 (I'm having to specify which device the timer needs to run on, which is VERY ANNOYING).  Perhaps my Show 8 is just a faulty device?  I suppose, but seems strange that it worked fine for a while then started doing this almost continuously.  But I guess it could be an issue with this specific device as opposed to some overall design fault (i.e., somehow microphone degraded, etc. and now it thinks I'm farther away than I am and that the Show 5 is closer because it ""hears"" me better).

If I need something from home or for the fiance to do something, I can drop in with a quick message that he actually hears (unlike his phone, which he usually has set to vibrate).Some people complain about the Alexa skills that scroll across the bottom of the screen. I like them, and use them to learn more about the world. Alexa has access to so much knowledge, why wouldn't anyone want to learn more? It's not like it takes up a huge part of the screen. Technically speaking, I have the unit turned up to about 30% of the volume, and it is plenty loud for my music. If my neighbors ever have one of their parties til 3am again, it might get turned up to 100 at 7am, just for our amusement.But seriously, these are great little gadgets that provide plenty of uses for a decent price.

It required a couple of lengthy phone calls to Amazon to get my cell phone number disassociated and their number associated.Also, on one of those calls, I had the person tell me that my Amazon account and my Alexa account are linked. They are not!If you don’t want to give access to all your phone’s contact, you can set up contacts separately but it’s not at all intuitive. It took me a while to figure it out.

The controls for you to skip, pause, etc are hidden with each new song that comes on. Not to mention the insane delay between songs.Don’t get me started on her lack of ability to answer any question correctly.

It was time to get customer support on the line. They had me do a factory reset on the device and wala just like that it started working again. Awesome right? Wrong! I had the same issue the next day, day after that and day after that. Every night for almost a week I’ve had to do a factory reset on the device in order to watch more than 5 mins of tv show. It was time to get customer support back on the line. I spoke with the support who stated I’d need to send the device in to their support team to see if they could fix it and if they couldnt they’d replace. That’s all well and good but at 3 months old it shouldn’t be having any issues. Maybe they sent me a lemon? Who knows but what I do know is after only 3 months of use it should still be working just as good as the day I took it out of the box.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2020"

I just had to realize it's just a program and can only do what the program allows,My dot just seemed to get smarter every daySo I expected  the show to be even better.The sound is much better and being able to see cameras is cool but it cant do much more than dot, it's the same program with videoAdded .I got it at a great price so I am happy I moved the dot to the bedroom so now i don't  have to tell but it seems like the show doesn't understand as well ( different mic?)

460,C.S. Thomas,***SEE UPDATED REVIEW!***,"  ***UPDATE - the speaker sounds INCREDIBLY static when playing music. I first used the Chat feature to try to resolve it; the Amazon rep advised me to unplug it for a few minutes then plug it back in. It resolved it for a few seconds, but went right back to static after 20-30 seconds. OBVIOUSLY A DEFECTIVE UNIT. I then spoke with a rep who had me reset the factory defaults and reinstall it. Still static. Then the rep could not replace it with a brand new one, WHICH IS WHAT I BOUGHT AND PAID FOR - she could only replace it with a certified refurbished unit.  Don’t know how Amazon makes sense of THAT. Well, if the replacement unit winds up being defective as well, it will go back for good with a refund requested.  Will update this review again***This thing has GREAT resolution and sound.  It would have gotten 5 stars, except for one thing.  On the home screen, it can only display the outside temperature.  Since I have my Amazon Echos linked to my Honeywell wifi thermostat, it should give you the option of displaying the INSIDE TEMP as well as the outside temp ON THE HOME SCREEN.Amazon Echo engineers or programmers, you should make this an option.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2021"
461,Shopper,Decent device for a kitchen or utility room,"  I like this for the kitchen or any place I need to quickly get weather reports, check the latest news briefings, the stock market or listen casually to some classical music while whipping up a sous-vide ribeye steak and all the fixings on the side. It's a great companion device that breaks the silence while you weave your magic cooking up the next meal. It'd be also useful in a laundry room where you are folding clothes while dancing to the latest Taylor Swift album. Wait, her last album (as of this review) is ""folklore"" and most songs are not really danceable to.Outside of that, the usefulness of the Ring and Amazon Camera integration allows me to see who's outside or in other parts of the house as well. Just need to make sure my son isn't sneaking in my beside table swiping a $20 bill from my wallet. Wait, where's he going to go blow it on anyway if all the bars are closed in our city due to the pandemic? Nevermind!This isn't a device for a main media room or anything else. I wouldn't use it in my office either since it might pick up some sensitive work conversations and I don't want to give Bezos any additional insight to competitive advantage work that my company is focused on.Pick up the 8 instead of the 5.

462,Shopper,I'm in love with Alexa,"  She's smarter than I am. She knows lots of stuff and does lots of things that you wouldn't expect her to. For example, over a period of days, when I run out of a food item I can say ""Alexa, add tomato paste, or celery, or white onions to my grocery list"". Then when I'm ready to go to the store I say ""Alexa, print out my grocery list"", and she immediately sends it to my printer. (How she does that I don't know, because I don't think I ever told her about my printer). Or another example, I'm on a renal diet and when I ask her for kidney-friendly recipes she immediately displays a number of them and offers to look for more. Or I can see ""Alexa, show me some recipes for eggplant--or portobello mushooms, or cabbage, or cauliflower, or whatever and she instantly shows me a couple dozen"". Or while cooking I like to listen to music, so I can say ""Alexa, play Vangelis, or Enya, or Tina Turner, or just classical music, or smooth jazz or whatever, and she will play an astonishing repertoire of music. Her sound is great. She sits in my kitchen right alongside my Bose and sounds almost as good as Bose's legendary speakers.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2020"
463,Bichon Mom,Not impressed,"  I was looking forward to utilizing this device in our living room primarily for our ring doorbell. Like many, our hardwired ring caused the chime to constantly vibrate. The constant buzzing noise was maddening and after many failed attempts to fix it, we just unplugged it. We had hoped that the echo would be able to display motion alerts as well as actual ringing of the doorbell. It does not. In fact, I’m not sure what it really does because set up was absolutely horrid. It was not at all user friendly. It’s constantly bouncing between phones, at ALL hours of the day and night. Nothing like Alexa saying “now streaming from “name”” at 3 AM. I thought the picture display screensaver was neat until it started displaying pictures from I don’t know when and that I cannot seem to locate but somehow it did? Overall, I wouldn’t purchase it again and I’m not impressed enough to recommend it.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2021"
464,Bichon Mom,This is primarily an advertising device,"  While the echo show line seems like a good idea to have around the house, keep in mind, it's primary purpose is to advertise Amazon and Alexa products and services.  All of the other services are secondary.  There are settings to turn off the ""spam"" that Amazon sends, but they regularly add more, and you have to go turn those off too.  Eventually, you give up, and just ignore the ads.  They have added some things that just ""come up on your screen"" that you can't turn off at all.  I have 6 echo devices with screens, and they are slowly being pushed back behind things, or getting unplugged.Amazon says they don't sell the echo devices at a loss, unless they're on sale, which they are most of the time.  If Amazon is ever willing to sell them at a loss, there needs to be another reason they want  you to have them, and that's be cause it's an always on, always there advertising screen that you can't control.If you're ok with that, they're great devices.

465,Agnus Hoffsteder,"Amazing, Best Alexa Device Hands Down!","  We are extremely happy with our purchase... I typically don't give detailed reviews, but this Echo Show 8 definitely deserves to be heard and reviewed!!After browsing through the many different options Amazon has in Alexa Devices, we decided to go with the Echo Show 8 primarily because it's screen size and added benefits & features as compared to other Alexa Devices.We definitely made the right choice. The screen quality at 8"" is very good and in HD Quality, comparable to a Samsung Tablet in screen quality. I have to admit, I was pretty amazed at the quality with the price tag the Echo Show 8 has. I'd expect to pay more, the screen quality is that good.The sound quality is crazy good. It has perfect bass and treble and sounds better in loudness and quality as compared to other big name Bluetooth speakers out there, I have had a few... If you play music on this device, you can literally fill your entire home with the music, it is that loud if you want it to be and it does not lose sound quality at maximum volumes either.It integrates seamlessly with other services including Ring, Wyze, Prime Video, to name a few. Also,, the voice recognition is also yet another great aspect of this Alexa Device. I can be in my dining room and Alexa will respond from my kitchen. I have yet to have any issues at all with the voice recognition.What's better than having an Alexa Device that has a screen? You can watch movies, look at recipes, watch news updates  and so much more with the Echo Show 8!To summarize, with the added benefits and features as well as the amazing quality that the Echo Show 8 has, you definitely won't be disappointed in your purchase.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2021"

We use it when kids ask weird questions that have great learning opportunities (like: Mom and Dad- what is Mount Rushmore? Or How many kinds of frogs are found in Wisconsin?). We use it for recipe ideas.  We use it for music (with lyrics).  We use it for shopping lists linked to our phone.Of note- we don’t use the voice recognition very much that I am aware of.  For example, my wife taught Alexa her voice.  But then, when she calls out, the device asks: “who shall I say is calling?“  Why does that need to be clarified if Alexa has learned her voice?  So, we don’t completely understand that feature.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2020"

I couldn't use my smart phone and I called her through the Alexa show she had her phone and I held up my fingers to show her my dilemma.  That alone made the systems worth it. The clock is large enough for me to see across the room without my glasses, the sound is rich, the song lyrics are on the screen so I know the words to new songs now.

470,bitbob,It does it's job.,"  Due to other echo devices, I have the camera turned off and the unit called Computer, rather than the traditional alexa.Pros:The device seems to be well made, have decent video and audio capabilities.  It has the standard Echo capabilities plus the ability to see certain answers on a screen.  The 8"" unit is a very good size choice for me.Cons:The screen keeps coming on for no reason and requires manual (voice) shut off.  The screen always shows the time, which would be ok if the display moved around like most screen savers.  As it is, I would think the time would burn in after a period of time.I do really wish there was a wider choice of trigger names for the echo family of devices.  ""Alexa"", ""computer"" and ""echo"" are too common and cause a lot of ""False"" responses from the devices.

471,Woody,Much better than the 5 inch,"  I bought the 5 inch on Prime day. I like it. It's a great bedside clock and it does things that need a screen, like finding a book or music playlist. But the screen is small. The 8 seemed huge when I opened the box. Just huge. But it's a very nice screen, and very suitable for the free Prime Video stuff. I think the overall experience is getting better. With the screen, I can find Audible books fairly easily. The books synch  pretty well with my smartphone. I like that there is no downloading, they just stream. A lot of the videos that come up are interesting. You can hone things to what you want like the stock market or NFL scores, etc. If I want to hear a song, I can generally just ask for it, but it helps to have the Unlimited service, not the free one. Sometimes when I ask for a shopping suggestion, I get really good and in-depth information. But not always. I use it in the kitchen, so it's great for timers and I'd like to find good recipes. It was worth it, for me. Honestly, my $25 Dot seems pretty worthless now. The Dot had decent audio, but this is quite good.

The display is really good and many people in the office have commented on the quality of my photos. The reason I took one start off is that sometimes the display stops on one picture and seems to have locked-up. But the Alexa voice part still works.

I had an electrician experienced with camera doorbell installations attempt to install the RingPro. He was unsuccessful despite repeated conversations with Ring Advanced Tech Support, which was exceptional I might add. The root cause of the problem as determined by Ring is that the latest Xfinity dual band modem/router is incompatible with the RingPro, which repeatedly lost connection with the WIFI signal, which is very strong in my case.  If the Echo Show 8 loss of connection is related to being used in conjunction with the latest high end Xfinity dual band equipment is an issue, I cannot answer.

I am a little displeased with the connectivity time with the ring products, by the time it notifies movement and you request to see that ring device, the cause of the movement is usually gone and you have to rely on the Ring recording.But the biggest flaw I see is that the Show is not portable, meaning if you have it on your desk, but want to use it for referring to a recipe in the kitchen you need to unplug and then replug. If the Show could have a re-chargeable battery for moving from 1 place to another for short term use, it would make it an awesome tool, but sadly Amazon didn't take that into consideration at this point in time and I am sure there will be no retrofitting and we will need to buy a new Show and just give Amazon more of our money.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2021"

The software is dumbed down, they could have taken existing Fire tablet software and added Alexa integration and it would have been a much better product. The interface is clunky and slow and Amazon seems to think it is an in home billboard.

Set it up no problem at first until I discovered that it would not receive calls like the older model Echo show. The problem is I cannot get the echo 8 show to VALIDATE THE EMERGENCY ADDRESS in the Alexa App.  So I used the chat option with Amazon to chat with a technical representative.  In the span of nearly 2 hours I chatted with 3 techs, the third of which was the absolute worst. He kept texting me to update my software, I kept texting him the software was up to date, he replied your problem will be fixed if you update.  So to sum up this nightmare I got very upset and terminated the chat. With the third tech I could have found the needle in the Pacific Ocean. Between the 3 techs I unplugged the unit waited 30 seconds 6 times, deactivated unit, changed address, reset the modem no solution. Day 2 called Amazon support the female i spoke with was very helpful but the issue is still unresolved.  I was informed one possible issue causing the problem is that USPS has my address listed as a vacant lot therefore my address cannot be validated. I've lived here for 20 years and the older echo is validate and so are my echo dots. So I called the USPS and the person I spoke with told be it could take a week to find and correct the problem if my address is listed as vacant.

So if you do as I do, and find recipes all over the place and then want to use them for actual cooking, there is no way to get that recipe to this device to use it in the kitchen.There are strange workarounds that involve setting up the Echo Show with an email or twitter account and then sending items to it.

486,Jeff Wright,"Nice Echo upgrade, great with Ring","  I asked for this to replace an Echo that kept randomly dropping offline despite repeated resets and other troubleshooting measures which failed. In addition to the usual Alexa functions and great sound, I wanted to be able to view the area covered by my Ring doorbell without always having to scramble to open the Ring app on my phone. The Echo Show does these things very well. There are occasional hiccups with my voice instructions not being recognized, usually when the TV is on or there’s a lot of ambient noise. Sound quality for music and video is great. The screen is nice and bright, picture is sharp. I haven’t used the touch screen very much except during the initial setup, but screen response seems on par with my other touch screen devices. My wish list item for this device is to have the ability to use it for video chats on Facebook Messenger, but I don’t expect that to happen anytime soon, if ever, because Amazon allows that sort of communication only within their own universe. Also, presumably because of the competition between Amazon and Google, there’s no Chrome browser. I’ve subtracted a star for these inconveniences, since nowadays almost everything with a screen lets users video chat on Messenger, and lots of folks prefer the Chrome browser.

487,C. Abe,"Constant Ads and ""Tips"" Ruin the Experience","  In addition to being hard of hearing, the Echo Show has just become annoying. Used to display a rotation of your pictures, the giant clock display, along with the barrage of ads and tips ruins the experience. Interestingly, the clock display becomes small and pushed off to a corner while displaying tips and ads, but becomes so large over your displayed picture rotation as to ruin many of your pictures. And this is all with ever option of displaying content turned OFF. I can only imagine how bad it would be with any other content turned on. If you search on the web, you'll learn that there are a great number of people having this same experience. And it gets worse over time and with every firmware update.

488,vetteface,Nice,"  So far the Echo Show 8 works as promised. It is easy to use and set up. The Echo arrived earlier than expected which was quite nice considering the problems the US postal service has had with their deliveries this holiday season. I have asked Alexa to play songs of my choice, as well as letting her pick some, what the weather will be for the day, and have added some of my own pictures to be used as rotating wallpaper. A lot of reviewers do not like the Alexa suggestions that show up on the screen with apparently no way to remove them. After reading their comments on that feature in particular, I did hesitate a bit before ordering the Echo Show 8. I am happy I did not let the comments determine my decision to purchase the Echo Show, because the suggestions do not bother me, and if I had listened to their negativity I would not have purchased this great little machine.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2020"

490,theresa rigoli,Worthless -- I returned mine and went back to my Echo Dot,"  I used to have an Echo Dot in my bedroom, but because of the great deals over Black Friday, I decided to pick up an Echo Show. The whole endeavor can be summed up in one word: Why? Why put a video screen on something that only needs audio? My NPR News briefing didn't get much added value from a 10-second video intro of the hosts, or from the B-roll footage they played while the reporters were talking. There's no Netflix browser. No YouTube unless you want to go through the crappy web version. No way to easily play slide shows of interesting things. I would have loved to say ""Alexa play a slideshow of nature photos"" or something like that... but that only works if you go beforehand to your Amazon account and set up a photo album of nature shots and then invoke that specific album. Why? There is so much wasted opportunity.Plus I didn't like how even at the lowest brightness setting, it was too bright for my room at night. I ended up turning off the display at night entirely -- which made me question why I had ever purchased this thing in the first place.Returned. Don't buy it.

It took about 20 tries before I figured out how to actually get her to show a recipe with directions. (""Alexa tell me a recipe"" then ask her for the type of recipe.) Otherwise she would find recipes with brief descriptions that had no instructions. The sound quality was terrible from day one. There may have been something wrong with it but the speaker kept making a glitch sound multiple times throughout a song. She was basically a glorified clock. We returned it after a week.

The sound only comes out of the back of the device so it makes it very difficult to hear if you're trying to watch the screen and listen. You literally have to turn it around so the screen is facing backwards to get the clearest crispest sound.The device is slow and laggy often as well, often taking 10-30 seconds to connect to my ring doorbell. (with a 500mbps internet speed)You can watch Amazon prime video and Hulu but the device does not do a good job syncing with other devices on where you left off during a show so it makes it really difficult to pick up a show or leave off. It just doesn't work. Also the navigation inside those apps is next to nothing. You can choose from the most popular categories but there's zero discovery available.One thing I really wish it had the ability to do is customize the home screen beyond what Amazon deems as news.

Yes you can ask Alexa to show you the front door or whatever it is that you have named your particular camera, and you can see the picture and hear audio from the other side, but the person on the other end cannot hear you. What use is it to be able to see the person at your door and hear them when they cannot hear you and you cannot communicate with them? I called customer support and they did verify that Alexa echo show devices do not support two-way communication with blink cameras. If you ask your echo show to talk to the front door camera it will respond that this device dies not support that feature.

It's been driving me crazy since I bought this thing. Anyone accustomed to the Google assistant is going to be sorely disappointed.More general issues that constantly recur;* Alexa has awful keyword recognition for the news stories that Echo is always shoving down your throat. If you don't say the /exact phrase/ at the bottom of the note (""Alexa, play the ... story""), you're out of luck. Even a concise reference to the story based on the content of the title/tagline regularly puzzles it.* Alexa does not consistently interpret common requests. My request ""Play NPR news"" seems to bounce randomly between playing a singular daily podcast, and running an ""app"" (or something?) that plays a constant stream of stories and ads. I haven't figured out what's going on there yet.* Alexa, recently, has decided that I need to hear news from every single provider every morning. When I say ""Echo, play BBC news"", she will play the ~10 minute podcast. Cool.  But, then she declares ""Playing new from other providers"", and it just keeps going! Who wants that? Why would that be the default behavior? Why can't it be turned off? Now I need to tell her to shut up every morning after the end of the BBC podcast, which is the only one I care about.* When playing an audiobook, the display randomly bounces between the audiobook progress bar, and the random spam that's usually littering the display.* You can tell Alexa to turn the screen off. But you can't convince her to keep it off.* Did I mention how bad Alexa is at interpreting things? That's still the biggest issue.But, at least I can turn off my living room lights without getting off the couch. Well, as long as I'm careful to specify my ""living room"" lights.

No need for Amazon music, I did have amazon music but cancelled it when I realized how easy it was to use Tidal.  My 10 year old also loves to watch shows while having breakfast or lunch. I love all the messages or hints Alexa displays while not using. Alexa gives me recipe ideas that look good, so I tell her to show me the recipe and I've actually tried them out for dinner.

507,George,still undecided,"  Update:Pros: When you set reminders they show up on the screen before to remind you they are coming and they stay on the screen for a short while after. This is a really nice feature.Cons: there is a basic sound mixer with bass, mid and treble to adjust the sound of the device. The only problem is the settings wont save so you have to reset them every day or every time you want to listen to music. This can be  a pain when you have several alexa devices and have to redo sound settings every time you want to play music on them all at once throughout the house.I purchased two echo show 8's when they had them on special. I an echo and an echo dot, but these were my first echo devices with screens so I wasnt sure what to expect. I mainly decided to try them due to amazing price they had that day.The size of the screen is not bad for a device. I just havent found too many uses for my echo show compared to my plain echo due to limited skill sets.Screen: the screen has nice a nice image for a device, colors are on the cool side.  It will show you the hourly weather which is nice. You can stream prime videos and when you play music it will display lyrics for some songs.  You can ask alexa to show you a map of traffic for your work commute,  but the map is zoomed out so far you cant tell which roads/route is highlighted. You are also unable to zoom in. If the map view was closer or you could zoom in this would be a great feature.  I have blink cameras and the echo show will bring up the live view from the cameras. The image looks good but the buffering time to bring up the image is a good 10-15 seconds similar to my firestick, so anyone at the door will likely be gone by then. It would be nice if they could get the buffering time down so it opens as fast as it does with the blink app on my phone. You can choose slide shows to play on the screen, for example I am using nature or you can create your own. You can go into settings and turn off the advertisements for websites and news which is nice.  However there is no way I have found yet to turn off the banner at the bottom of the screen advertising alexa skills with ""try this"" The clock is relegated to a tiny corner on the upper left with no way to make it bigger. it would be nice to be able to customize size and design of clock.Sound: The speakers are slightly bigger than the echo dot and in similar fashion the show 8 does not have dolby so the sound is more similar to an echo dot.  It doesnt sound bad on low, but any bass in the music cant be reproduced and ends up just muddling the sound. If you are used to echo dot, then you will be happy with the sound from the echo show. If you are used to regular echo or echo plus, you will find the sound quality to be less and lacking bass. Although to be fair, if you are streaming music then you not exactly an audiophile or overly concerned about sound quality anyway.  I currently have an echo show 8 in master bed and living room, an echo in kitchen and dot in basement. When playing music you can set it to stream out of all the devices at once. This is nice for when you are choring around the house, as you move from room to room the music follows. You are supposed to be able to do this reminders/alarms as well, but when I set reminders to play from ""everywhere"" it still only plays from the device I used to set it up?Camera: The echo show has a camera for face to face streaming through drop in feature. The camera is only 1 mp so the quality is pretty low. I was thinking I could use the drop in feature to use the echo show like a security camera and check in on my pets while at work. The natural tilt of the echo show without a stand directs the camera view to the ceiling. You can put it on a stand, but to get a decent view of the room through the camera the screen/echo show has to be basically vertical. Unless your echo show it at eye level, this makes using the screen awkward. So between the camera direction and low quality of image I cant really use it as a security camera to view rooms when away from home. The drop in is a nice feature to communicate with other family members or friends.Privacy features: the ""shutter"" switch to cover the camera is a great feature. Not only does it physically cover the camera but you can see that it is covered for reassurance. This is great so a friend or family member doesnt drop in while your walking around in your underwear. You can also push another button to turn off the camera and the microphones so amazon cant listen to you hatch your plans for world domination. As with other Amazon devices wireless connectivity is good, I have never had wifi connectivity issues with any of my amazon devices.Overall its not a bad device. The sound is subpar to my echo (but on par with an echo dot)and with limited skills and small screen size I dont really find uses for having a screened echo device. I can put one in my basement so I can pull up my blink front door camera when someone rings doorbell, but long buffering time means they might leave or it would be easier to just run upstairs and check the door. If the traffic maps were zoomed in so you could identify individual routes it would make that a great feature.  It could double as a security camera to drop in an check on inside house or pets if the camera was better quality and not aimed at the ceiling.  I got them at an amazing price, but at this point I am undecided if I will keep them. I might just trade them back in for another echo.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2020"

Sound is good, screen is average some backlight bleed, but overall for the price this device works.To be clear my main issue, as with many owners, is that Amazon needs to add the software code from their Echo Show 5 which allows more flexibility in screen display options.

I thought, perhaps, the echo show was unplugged but as soon as I wake it, it responds like normal. I'm not sure if this has been a known issue but it just happened suddenly without explanation. This is my only issue with my device and has been very annoying since it started. Mainly because when I wake up in the middle of the night, I'd like to see the time and it's not visible due to the dark screen.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2021"
513,Bryan S ,"I love my Alexa, but i think she is distracted.","  First of all i love home intevration and automation.  The Amazon Echo initially wrote the book.  But i'm starting to fear that Amazon is sitting on their laurels. Don't get me wrong this is still a great product but I am finding more and more products tightly integrating with google nest than with Amazon.  Also instructions on how to use Alexa are not readily available nor easy to find.  What documentation is available provides only a high level view.  We need documentaion that provides step by step help and that is current with the version of Alexa software and the device you are using.  I can't even get drop in to work properly continually getting an error that ""Sally has not provided you permission for drop in calling.""  While i still enjoy the experience i feel Amazon has some work to do to regain their ""leader of the pack status"" or i fear Alexa may lose more partners pushing us to other products offering tighter integration.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2021"
514,Dave Hoyt,"Echo Show 8, Alexa and Zoom Meeting for the Blind","  I bought these for the possibility of helping our Blind friends achieve more independence in our Congregation Zoom Meetings. For the most part they work fine. They can give Alexa voice commands to join any meeting that exist in their calendar app on their iPhone.These are the areas it could be improved:1- Give user permission to allow Host or Co-host to Mute and Unmute and turn video on and off. Right now, they must be told to press the power button once or twice to get their microphone on to comment and sometimes to be seen.2- Voice command to join meetings must be repeated as the first time only opens the Zoom app. This gets frustrating especially when given multiple meetings schedules during the same time periods, Alexa will give a voice/vocal listing up to three meetings listed in the calendar. In saying YES to the one you want it opens Zoom and then does nothing. Users then must repeat that same vocal exchange again to actually get into the meeting of their choice.3- As I said, Alexa will only give a listing of three meetings it finds scheduled at the same time in the calendar at any one time. To get to anything beyond three … answer “no” three time to the three-options Alexa presented and ask Alexa again to join meeting and it will see that there is a fourth in your calendar and present it as the third on the second or third try!!!Get Alexa to connect to Zoom Meetings on the first try, give mute/unmute and camera on/off abilities to Host with end user permissions and allow Alexa to read off all or at least four meetings that may be scheduled during the same time periods. Fix these issues and this will be a five-star value for the Blind!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2021"

After rebooting it, doing multiple factory resets I spoke with someone on the phone to help me 'trouble shoot'.  They told me to do the exact things I'd already tried.  She finally said I needed to mail it back so they could try to repair it.  If it could not be repaired, it would be replaced.  This seemed annoying, but at least they had a plan to fix it for me.  Today a $58 return shows up in my account.  Apparently it wasn't fixable and they don't have the option to replace it.  When I called rather unhappy that they weren't just going to send me a new one, I was told the difference in price was a restocking fee.  She seemed confused on me questioning how they would charge a restocking fee on an item they claimed couldn't be fixed.  After 'supervisor' approval she was willing to give me $13 towards the puchase of a new one.I really like this product, when it works...  It's just sad that they keep failing and when I first starting looking up how to troubleshoot this issue it's very apparent this is a very common issue.  The conclusion to the call was her offering me 15% off of a new one.  My final question to her was why would I keep buying an item that keeps breaking, when Amazon won't stand behind their product when it breaks?  This was followed by extreme silence.Guess I'll give google's products a try instead.  I'm fully expecting Amazon to take this review down because there is far too much truth for one post.

They gave me the full purchase price as a credit toward the Show 8.  Ended up only costing me $5 with the $99 sale price.So now to the review.  It should be noted that I have a Show 5 as well, so I will make a couple of references when going over features and function.  To start, as HUGE plus is the ability to physically disable the camera.  This is something that the show 5 had but the Echo Spot didn't.  Its nice having the peace of mind not having to worry about anyone's privacy, no matter what room the device is in.The Screen is HUGE, bright and clear.  Its nice not having to watch distorted videos on a round screen.  Its a great price point between the show 5 and the original Echo Show.  The camera is the same as the Show 5 @ 1mp, more then enough for video chat.  It looks clear, with now distortions. This of course will depend on your internet/WiFi connectivity. The sound quality is very good.  Its not a $2k audio system, but its not a cheep pair of headphones ether...  The sound is rich and full and quite enjoyable.  Functionally its like any other Alexa device.Now for the issues.  The two big ones, and the reason for knocking off the 2 stars, is first, the LIMITED availability of clock face customization.  If you go to settings and select clock & faces, all you can pick is the clock background.  The HUGE face, and the time is limited to being displayed in one corner.  The Show 5 had all kinds of face options, but this one only lets you pick the backgrounds.  Yes you can have a photo or something from Facebook, a couple of ugly pictures and a single semi solid background, but that's it.  You should at the very least be able to have the time take up most of the screen to be able to see it at night or from across the room.  The show 5 has customization, why is it not part of the Show 8 as wellThe other one is an annoyance with every screen based Alexa device I have ever owned.  YOU CAN NOT DISABLE THE ""THINGS TO TRY"" TEXT.  Its in the middle of, or on the bottom of almost EVERY card that the device displays.  You can turn off everything else, but not that....  I want to have it rotate between time & weather...  THAT'S ALL.  If I need to find new things to try I will look it up myself....  This has annoyed me and A LOT of other people for a very long time.

Most mornings it goes on fine, then occasionally there  is a glitch where the music does not play and she won’t connect with the station.  Other times the music alarm will play, after about an hour it will shut/stop, ok. At that time I will ask Alexa to connect to that same station, her response is “I cannot connect that station is unavailable”  I don't always have my phone nearby to use the app and with my failing eyesight it is sometimes hard to see/use the app. It is something I will have to get use to and move on.

Trying to find shows on prime or Tubi is annoying. Can't cast from your phone like you can with Google's product. Even when you do fumble through the UI and find a video, you can't pause it for too long or it will take you back to an empty home screen with no way to quickly go back. It doesn't integrate well with ring .. you expect it to automatically show you the front door when someone rings it but it doesn't. You can't install apps .. just those skills plugins. No id shows, no comcast, no anything I want to see.  Separately Alexa has become very annoying (obviously on all devices). You want her to just be your robot slave that does what you command and nothing else, but instead of that she will take your time to advertise something, telling you by the way this and by the way that, suggesting things and really not treating your time like it is valuable.

I only bought this, 2 of them, so that I could send one to my father at his assisted living in order to stay in touch... and give him some company (books read to him, music, look at photos, etc.).  I have not been able to test how this works since he was hospitalized shortly after I bought them.  However, in setting them up in my home, I've come across many user unfriendly features among other things.  The biggest unfriendly feature is figuring out where to manage everything.  Everything from contacts for phone calls to apps to music to books. Sometimes you do this, manage, on the device, sometimes through the smart phone app, sometimes on a website, sometimes through 3rd party... really really off putting to say the least.  For a device that is supposed to simplify or enhance your life, it is the opposite due to these management issues.  Even more maddening is all the commands that have to be learned verbatim.  This is not going to go well for my father, I can already tell.  I could print out a list of commands but then again, he's losing his sight.  Real life seems to take a backseat in a lot of how this device works, but I digress...So far having books read to me (still testing it until my father is out of the hospital) & looking at photos, are working.  However, if you make a mistake in signing up for Amazon music on the phone app, then you won't get family, and the device will not play different music on diff devices at the same time. And if you try to change it, it won't let you til the trial period is over.  That some people might die, literally, before that happens doesn't seem to have even been considered.  Just another example of user unfriendly features.Audible on the other hand, is awesome and responsive to customers changing needs.  Thought I'd at least highlight something positive.  Although, a couple of the books I've chosen don't play, but again, I've been able to swap them out thereby, grateful somebody was thinking of people & real life.Long story short, if you only want to buy stuff, have books read to you, look at photos, listen to music & have no family, then this device is for you!  (have yet to test calls & drop ins)This device could really benefit from developers & QA testers who have families, friends, and elderly parents (who they don't live with).

But the one reason that I got it was the Alexa drop-in communications which allows you to have a video call without answering the phone. We have a disabled family member who would not be able to initiate or answer calls o their own, so the Echo Show solved the issue by providing this function. I can call them anytime with the Alexa app on my phone and be able to see them and talk to them directly, after setting up and enabling this feature. My biggest fear is that one day in an upgrade, they decide to disable this feature because of potential privacy issues. It is working seamlessly now and better than any similar solutions on other platforms including Skype and IP cameras for years. This product deserves an award for this very feature.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2021"
540,Mike,Worth the extra money over the 5,"  Ive tried all the echos that have a screen and the echo 8 is more impressive than i was expecting. The echo 5 is a great alarm clock replacement. The size allows it to fit well on a night stand and its handy for smart device control, podcast, video chat but its limited in what videos it can play and the sound isnt anything to write home about. The echo 8 breaks free of all the negative aspects of the echo 5. If you are looking for something to watch video on and listen to music the echo 8 is a much better choice. The volume is louder and the bass is surprisingly good for this type of device. You can feel the bass. It also playa hulu and more video options than the echo 5. Its not a fire tv replacement as not all video apps work on the echo shows. The big echo obviously has a larger screen and its significantly more expensive. If watching video is your top concern stick to the 10 inch or the echo 8. If having a bedside smart device to control smart devices, wake you up and use for communication the echo 5 is the best option. The echo 5 is surprisingly unobtrusive on the nightstand where as the echo 8 is pretty noticeable. The echo 8 is a great value at the current sale price. If your on the fence buy it! You won’t regret it. I wish i had a need for another given the price.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2019"

The echo show 8 hears what I say wrong half the time and starts playing random music. I bought an outdoor camera blink, and it continues to buffer on my echo show 8. It's something that definitely hasn't been perfected. Sound quality is good. It seems to be a good speaker sovfar. And it looks nice but performance wise, it's a little cave mannie. Prehistoric. Please upgrade software. ⭐⭐⭐⭐UPDATE: So I had to change the rating from 4 to 1 star.⭐. The reason is I bought a brand new show 8 and it's defective. So Amazon sent me another one. Upon inspecting the package, i see it's refurbished. So I contact customer service and they end up giving me a refund. Their new policy, which I wasn't notified about, won't send a brand new device if yours is defective. No no, you get a refurbished one even though you paid full price for the brand new one. It makes no sense. All that does is harm the customer. Amazon has gotten a lot richer, and quality and customer service have gotten really bad. They're punishing a customer by not sending a brand new device, if it's deemed defective or otherwise doesn't work. So you pay full price for a brand new device, and if you need a replacement, you get refurbished.

We have surround sound hooked up throughout our entire home that my husband may control on his iPhone; but I enjoy access Amazon music and being able to request playlists or any song at any moment - having it just play in the room that I’m in without having to mess with Spotify and changing the zones for speakers, etc. There is an option to hook that up through our surround sound as well but again, I really enjoy keeping it simple.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2022"

On my little phone I can see the clock and what's playing.On this comparatively huge screen, I have to pick either ""clock"" or ""what's playing"".

Plus, i noticed you cannot touch the screen to snooze the alarm like the echo spot can. I find it very odd that basic functions are not universal throughout these devices. Touching the screen to snooze seems like it should all be the same action on all these echo devices, but nope. also, a few of the commands goes wonky and doesn't do what its suppose to. I say, Alexa, turn on ""sleep sounds"" and it does. but then i say ""alexa, turn off sleep sounds"" and alexa doesn't know what the heck i am talking about. very strange.

The show does most things I want it to, shows my doorbell, plays party games, music, recipes, reminders, alarm clocks, you name it.  I did try alot of budget smart devices when Alexa integration was much newer and I wasn't impressed back then.... Fast forward many years later and I purchased this device along with a few new smart devices in a new home and it appears most of the kinks appear to have been worked out and it integrates with most devices smoothly.Only for stars because you have to be careful naming devices or rooms or Alexa can get confused with duplicates, sound quality could be a bit better for a device that is powered, a primary audio device, and is being used more frequently in main rooms of the house replacing other audio equipment. Some apps do bare bones and could be so much better. Dominoes comes to mind. You can order a recent out favorite order but after placing the order you have to ask for updates instead of taking advantage of the echo shows screen and showing the current order status on the screen much like you would on a computer or phone.Future iterations should be thinner and mountable.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2021"

Video calls are only to other people with other Alexa devices, doesn't support Zoom or Messenger.I use Fubo for my live TV viewing and it is not supported, nor I can watch on the Browser because it prompts me to download the app which is not able to download.When listening to music it is also very limited as it doesn't gives you the option to see the artist or go the album, it just start playing the songs and you can only go back.Also this Alexa understands me less than the Echo Dot. I have to repeat the things everytime because she shows me another thing. For example evey time I say Alexa show me the camera, she goes to Comedy 😒. Voice recognition is not so good, and as I said it is better on my Echo Dot.And lastly, I think it should have a skills page on Home, where you can see all the available skills ala Appstore, instead of going to Amazon website to do it.So, in summary, I think it is lacking a lot in the video department as much of the stuff is still done with the voice only and the screen is mere a display, not so much of a touch screen.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2020"

Since we are in COVID-19 lockdown, I am getting nightmare security issues trying to log into the account for the device.  My siblings can't get past the verification, and reverification process which disables the video calling features that this was purchased for.  Folks, it would go a long way to allow family members and contacts for the Echo Show to be l to able to make video calls into it from their smart phones without having to be signed into the Amazon account associated with the device.  It's a  poorly designed system when this was one of the advertized features.  Who knew Covid would prevent family members from going into the assisted living places to help resolve these issues but for the money put out, just have Granny get a smart phone.

550,Luke,Alexa cant multi-task,"  I bought this because i wanted a dedicated bedside device i could use to monitor security cameras. I usually do this with my ipad or phone, but i like to use those for other things, so wanted something specially for that. So disappointing; The echo has a great speaker, but you cant play music and show camera footage at the same time even when the microphone settings on the camera are off. When Alexa plays music the screen only shows the song playing‘s album cover, not even the clock, or a rotating photo album. You can only show one camera at a time as well, even when camera app has multiveiw  capabilities. The touch screen is anemic, you have to download the alexa app to do almost everything, and most controls are through your phone. I feel i would have been happier with a cheap android tablet. I will say the speaker sounds great. But even on special, $89 is too much for what amounts to nothing more than a gadgety  alarm clock with a good speaker.. also though I have some cameras that do work with Alexa viewing anything by having to ask Alexa to show it, instead of just touching the screen is a tedious process at best, with no option to record or use the 2 way microphone. And the cameras that i bought it for(because they were advertised with them on the amazon website!!)  just buffer, rarely showing footage at all. If at the least it scrolled through the different camera views id probably be happy, but having to say “alexa show camera one“... “alexa show camera two” is pointless. The echo show 8 inch takes up too much real estate on my nightstand and doesnt do enough. And being able to drop in on my dog sleeping on the bed while i work during the day?

It had decent sound and I like(d) that I could get the quick ""news"" of the day, like weather, in a nice convenient location.  The reason for the smaller down vote is that I had the unit on an Echo 8 specific stand which I really liked.

The top of the plate that came off has a stickiness to it but will not re-affix to the Show.  Pics attached of what the plate looks like.  Black piece is the bottom of the plate; the silver side is the ""sticky"" side that attaches to the bottom of the Show..  Since the stand attachment is magnetic it will no longer attach to the unit.Update:  Amazon ""replaced"" the unit but replaced it with a refurbished unit.  I've only had it about 2 months and the speaker quality has developed an echo.  Alexa has also started playing pieces of random videos that were never requested.

It weighs enough to be stable, but not cumbersome.Set-up was less than easy. It requires much more specific verbiage than the Nest. It also requires turning on a lot of options in the Alexa app before they'll function.  You also cannot use the Amazon Kids setup in addition to the adult one. You have to pick one. And for the love of all that is good, the endless ""try this"" suggestions are unwanted, not helpful and overbearing. I've made repeated attempts at turning it off. It is unbelievably irritating.

568,Soriano Fred,Too limited,"  Aside from the boomy quality of the sound, the worst aspect of the Show is the limited set of skills compared to other smart assistants. Ask Alexa to show you albums by an artist and it will display a selection of popular ones, but want to know what songs are on those albums? Good luck, that's too much for the Show. You'd think tapping on the icon of each album cover would be enough, but no, you have to fire up the Prime Music app on your phone for that. It's just one example of the shortsighted programming of this device. Want a large timer up on the screen the entire time you use it? Not possible. The Show will display the timer for only a few seconds then shrinks it so it can show other information on the screen.  That's good if you are watching a show at the same time or do not need the timer to be readable while it runs, but would an option to pin the timer be so hard to implement?

569,Richard Taft,Great Device for the Entire Family,"  OK, so despite some of the reviews I decided to purchase two of these for our kids for Christmas. I picked them up on the Back Friday deals. Our kids have been asking for a digital alarm clock for their rooms along with a TV. While not a fine of TV in the kids room this allows the kids to watch Prime Movies independently, and better yet when my wife and I are watching a show they don't like they can escape and watch what they want. The kids absolutely love them! Setup was a snap and after reading a few recent reviews making the ""tasks"" from displaying all the time was easy. The kids also like the live video calling feature to call each other. To put it simply, we love it so much we're going to purchase the 10"" for the Kitchen area. Oh, lastly, the enhanced privacy features is great fir the kids!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2019"
570,gloria b,Audio recognition is great!,"  It's is another toy, but so much more. I have iPhones, 2 taps, 1 echo and now 2 echo shows and the voice recognition is better than all the aforementioned... it brings the flash briefings (you set up in the Alexa app) to life. It is quick to open Youtube, Netflix, Hulu or play a song.It is a cool drop in video tool to call to another part of the house or tell them to come down... although my daughter and husband - don't feel like playing. The random desktop is nice, it shows; recipes, music, weather, time, Alexa skillsI set one up at my desk and I have used it everyday since Santa brought it to me. Love it.The drawbacks, the internet search is sooo small. It is not formatted for this source. Also the audio isn't the cleanest.

571,ktbt,We love it!,"  We bought the Show 8 for our kitchen, and we use it every day. Set up was simple, and the commands are intuitive. Voice recognition is top notch. It can “hear” me when I speak normally from across the room.  The size of the screen is great for reading and seeing text across the room. We mostly use it for listening to music from our Spotify account, setting  timers/alarms, playing family games, listening to stories (for the kids), answering random questions like, “when does Walmart close today?”, etc. We also have two of the smaller Show 5s (one in the basement, one in our bedroom, and the Show 8 in the kitchen), so we’re able to use them together as a hands free intercom system. From the kitchen I can say, “Alexa, announce that dinner is ready,” and it’ll let my kids in the basement know it’s time to come upstairs. We can also make hands-free video calls from one show to the next. Also, when someone rings our Ring doorbell, it announces that someone is at the door and automatically shows the video roll, though it takes about 10 seconds to load it (I wish it showed the video instantly). With my 1st grader in distance learning at home, he’s able to tell Alexa to set an alarm for a certain time to let him know when to get back to his zoom meeting after a break (that feature alone was worth the price! He’s 6 and can do that himself.). Unfortunately, my kids have also learned that Alexa can fart, so that’s their favorite thing to do right now. Haha.

572,J. Birch,"Works well, but a security hzard and annoying","  It's goofy you have to install an app on your phone to set-up and control an Echo, since it's already an Internet connected device. If you have personal security concerns, this device is NOT for you. While you CAN add contacts without allowing the Alexa app on your phone to have access to your phone's contact list, you are still adding an app without knowing exactly what info it is gathering and forwarding. My Echo was a gift to me, but honestly, the video phone feature, which is nice, could just as easily be satisfied by Skype, on a more portable platform like a laptop. If you want this device, and personal security, buy it, install the Alexa app on your phone, enter your contacts, then uninstall the app. You CANNOT add a contact directly via the Echo device, since contacts apparently are not stored locally - so be aware you are giving that info to Amazon to ""manage' for you. Also understand you are giving Amazon permissin to retain everything you do via the Echo, including recording your audio.After mucking with settings I was able to eliminate (turn off) the constant (and very annoying) scrolling through displays of trending topics, weather reports etc. I'd find that distracting and annoying if it was constantly in my field of vision. What you CAN'T turn-off is the never-ending scrolling of prompts at the bottom of the screen demanding you ""Try 'Alexa, do something or other'. Either cover it with a piece of tape, or turn the device so it's face-down.All that said, it works fine, if you don't mind having your calls recorded, your phone compromised, and essentially allowing a sophisticated eaves-dropping device in your home. Remember, the ""S"" in ""IOT"" stands for security.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2019"
573,Richard,Updated 11/23/2020 FYI Wyze Cam owners important info,"  Updated 11/23/2020 - after an update to the device yesterday it appears the buffering issue has been resolved for all wyze devices with one exception being the wyze cam pan. otherwise for the first time in months the echo show is not constantly buffering the image. also a first, where before the wyze image on the show would time out after a few minutes and go back to the home screen. now it keeps showing the wyze cam vid feed until you change things. for those who would use this as a baby monitor this is a very good development.Updated 11/21/2020 - the biggest reason we purchased this was to use along with our various wyze cam devices. unfortunately as i found out only after the fact, there has been an ongoing buffering issue between the two devices now for several months. sometimes you can watch a live stream from a wyze cam just fine. however more often than not you can't as every two seconds the screen freezes and buffers.of all our wyze devices only the new wyze cam outdoor does not do this. for some reason that model does just fine viewing on the echo. but the v1, v2, pan units all buffer to the point it is unusable. i like the show for the most part but the reason for the purchase didn't pan out and nobody at either end has a solution to date.original review - we started out years ago with the first echo and since have several generations of dots, echo plus, show 5 and this the 8"" show. as with its smaller cousin this unit works the same, does the same things.you can watch prime vids. you can use it as a clock. easy vid calls or even intercom within your home. you can manually block the camera if you don't want that aspect. if running a timer you'll not only hear it when its done but in the upper right corner of your home screen you'll see it counting down.if you ask it a question it'll not only give you an audible response but also pull up pertinent videos, information, etc. on screen for you to use. you can either tap on the screen or just stick to telling alexa what it is you want. you'll also get on screen weather, upcoming reminders, etc. fyi within the settings you can have it show you more or less depending on your personal preferences.settings can be accessed from the touch screen or using the alexa app. ours is set to auto dim. as evening approaches the screen dims and then when the lights are out it will go dark except for the on screen clock. you can however set it to go totally dark it comes down to your preferences.the audio quality is about on par with the echo plus. obviously not near the bass response but still a lot better than i had expected. it also has a 3.5mm audio jack at the rear which is nice to have.you can ask it to 'show' you just about anything. ask it what is an olde english bulldog and you'll get the audio response and imagery on screen. if you want more information just tap on one of those images or ask. we have both the show5 and this model. if you plan to watch vids frequently i definately would go with this size and not the smaller. related the screen resolution on this size is much better than the smaller show5.everything you need to get going is in the box. setup has somehow been made simpler than in other amazon devices. personally i do not see how they could have made getting started any easier. it really does walk you through each and every step with most of those being entirely automated.the two things i don't like about the device are listening and cam time out.  as to the listening to begin with i had frequent issues getting it to hear what i say correctly. the speed and how i speak where the other units do just fine this one misses words, gets the wrong ones or just sits there silent requiring multiple tries to acknowledge it heard 'alexa.' i have no accent to speak of. my speech sounds much like that you get from tv newscasters if that makes sense in regards to no accent. so i do not understand why the microphones have such a hard time hearing me compared to the others? so now i've learned to slow down my speaking and enunciate words as clearly as i can. when i do that problems listening are rare.the only other gripe has to do with the main reason i purchased this, for our Wyze Cams. once the Wyze app is enabled you can just say for example, ""alexa show me the front door."" it loads and then you are streaming to your echo with both video and audio. the image looks great but the gripe comes down to the built in 'time-out.' the video stream will only hold for a few minutes then it reverts back to the home screen. i hope this fix this soon, it should just be a coding issue.overall having the additional abilities the other echo units do not have. the combination of both audible and visual information. it is just a great design and even with the mic's not picking up as well as our other devices i'd still purchase it again.all said i would recommend this to most but due to the microphones for some it could be problematic. at least when you say something you also can see what it heard you on screen. otherwise i'd say this is a really good device and if considering say a regular echo unit or even a dot i would seriously consider this or its smaller cousin the 5"" model instead.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2020"

575,CHRISTINA,Bad Photo Display - CANNOT CHANGE CLOCK,"  If having a photo display is important to you, DO NOT BUY THIS!I am extremely disappointed with this product. I bought this for my wife for Christmas so she could have an electronic picture display. We use Amazon Echo devices, so the thought was that this would serve dual purposes. I soon found out this would not be the case.There are no settings to change the clock display. It mainly shows the bigger clock you can see in the first photo. Every once in awhile it will change to the smaller clock you can see in the second photo (no rhyme or reason to it; same photo will sometimes have the big clock and sometimes the smaller one). The smaller clock is the one I want because the bigger clock covers up a quarter of the photos.This got even more upsetting when I started searching for answers online. I thought I had to be missing something and that there must be a way to change the display settings of the clock. I was alarmed to find forum after forum filled with complaints about not being able to change the clock display. Some people want the clock to be full screen so they can see it better. Some, like me, want the clock to be smaller so it doesn't cover the photos. What's more unsettling is that the Echo Show 5 had options to change the clock display. Then, for some unknown reason, Amazon decided to take those options away for the Echo Show 8. Makes no sense to me!This device serves the Amazon Echo function fine and the sound quality is excellent. If music is all you want this for, then it might be ok.Versatility isn't great. If you want to be able to to the screen so you can see it best you need to buy the adjustable base which is sold separately and kind of exclamations for what it is.If you have no desire to display photos, this decide could be nice. However, if you would like to have a sideshow of photos for your viewing pleasure, do not purchase this.

576,Ronnie,Love The Nest Camera Skill Integration,  Excellent integration with the Nest Skill. Primary reason that I bought the Echo Show. Have 5 Nest cameras around the house and it’s nice to be able to ask to show each one instead of whipping out the phone to view them when I get motion alerts. There’s a bit of lag but that’s expected since you have to link the accounts and there’s some latency. One thing to note is a simple rescan of devices in the Alexa app will not detect a newly added camera. For that you have to disable the skill then reenable it to relink the account and detect the new camera. You’d figure a simple rescan should find the new camera but not that simple. The Echo Show compliments other Echo Dots and Echo around the house. The screen quality while watching videos and Prime movies is really crisp.

577,Stoffer,"Beautiful video, sound is very good, but not that intuitive","  The screen quality is excellent, the sound quality is very good, and the features are many.  In fact, that is a problem starting out.  There is no manual and online help is limited.  I suppose I could spring another $10 for a book, but why?  I'm already not happy that there is no pre-booking guarantee.  I pre-ordered for $99, and the day it arrived the price was $79, but I cannot get the lower price.There are many features but getting the most out of them is not always easy.  For example, the alarm has a repeat function for daily, weekly, weekends, or week days.  I work a rotating schedule so the days I need an alarm rotate every two weeks.  After a couple of weeks, I discovered if I touch the date once I set an alarm, I can get a calendar.  This way I can program just the days I want the alarm.  Too bad there isn't a manual to look this up.I'm sure the Echo Show will be more useful once I add more Alexa hardware and apps.  As it is, I'm turning on lights, setting the thermostat, utilizing time, temp, and alarm, listening to music, and watching video.  Other thing is, my wife hates to talk to Alexa.

I wish Amazon would enable an easier way for young children to use this device, very dissapointing as he still needs parental help to call me :(.THe sound is also very muffled, much more than our newest Echo dot, which is also very dissapointing because the cost is so much more...One other disappointment is when someone calls you on the Echo Show with their Echo Show, all Alexa devices notify you that there is a call coming in! We have an Echo dot in the bedroom that alerted an incoming call at 6am, much to the dismay of my husband. So now I turned off notifications for our bedroom Echo dot, but that also disables its ability to be used with the Drop In feature.

Alexa has provided my mother with easy access to news, music and  entertainment and is the main reason I decided to keep the system despite falling to meet purchasing expectations  as a doorbell system.  Where the Show 8 falls short is the integration with an Arlo doorbell.  In order to work with the Show 8 the Arlo video resolution must be lowered to the medium setting.  The HD video from the Arlo is not supported by the Show 8 and results in no video displayed  unless the Arlo door bell resolution is reduced.  There is a significan latency (delay) 20-30 seconds to connect to my Google Pixel 3 then 3-5 seconds delay in communication  after connection.  Latency with the Arlo to the Show 8 is a bit better  taking about 10 to 12 seconds to connect.  ( Wi-Fi router is between 15 to 20 feet from Arlo and Show8 )  Cannot configure the doorbell to just chime to the Show and must use the existing door bell buzzer. Arlo integration cannot not be set up to automatically open Arol app and show who's at the door.  User must instruct Alexa to ""Show 'MyDoor'"".  Arlo doorbell videos must be manually deleted  otherwise camera operation (including live view) will stop without warning because memory is full.

590,Anonintex,"Good device, but be warned","  This is a decent device. I got it on prime day for half price, which makes it a really good value. However, I have one warning for anyone using Alexa. If you install the Alexa app on your cell phone, be careful allowing Alexa to have access to your contact list. I mistakenly did this. I have hundreds of contacts, mostly work contacts. The last thing I want is to tell Alexa to call my wife and have her call one of my work contacts by mistake. Now, you might think, just delete the contacts from one of the Alexa devices. Not so fast!  Amazon has no provision to delete imported contacts. You can only delete contacts created in the Alexa app.There are a couple of hacks (I mean options) to deal with this. Neither of them pretty.1) Get a burner phone, register that number with Alexa and let her sync with an empty address book. Once all the contacts are gone, make sure to disable access to contacts on all your phones. This should work, but I have not tried it as I don't want to buy another cell phone, just to clear my contact list. Hmmm, maybe I could buy the cell on Amazon, use it to clear the contacts and then return it for a refund.2) Export all your contacts on your cell phone. Then delete all the contacts on the phone, let Alexa sync with an empty address book. Turn off Alexa's permission to the contact list. Import the contact list that was exported in the first step. This was the method that was recommended to me by Amazon customer service.Neither of these are ideal, to say the least. Having spent years writing software, I know sloppy coding when I see it. Creating a system where you can add things, but not delete them, is sloppy...period.My suggestion is, if you are just going to be using your Echo devices to call a fairly small group of people, like your family and friends, enter the contacts directly into the Alexa app, that way you can manage them. Do NOT allow the Alexa app to access the contact list on your phone.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2020"

In total, I have spent more than 3 hours on these 4 support calls because after about 30-45 mins of fumbling around, the Amazon support person has told me that they are really not that familiar with the Show product or with Amazon Photo product and they transfer me to someone else...who has more knowledge of the products.  These new support persons have access to ""step by step"" instructions (or can direct me to the Help section) with these ""step by step"" instructions to do specific tasks.  But even then, they cannot find or direct me to any ""step by step"" help to work with things like Photo Albums...If this Echo Show product is going to really be successful, Amazon needs to provide users like me with documentation on all of the products features and ""step by step"" instructions on how to take advantage and use these features.

I was hoping to get a clock that was larger than the show 5 and it was actually smaller and in the upper left hand corner. I could choose a different background but I couldn't  mix and match and change the clock style or face. As I got ready to reset it and start the return process, I noticed that the software was and older version and could be updated. If I hadn't gone to that area, I wouldn't have known that. No prompts on it at all. I got excited when I noticed the the newer software version was the same as the Show 5 so I stopped, updated and waited. Other than having the same version number there was no change in options. I love my Show 5 but the 8 just isn't for me.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2020"

594,Terese King,Small clock. Small time device.,"  I was under the assumption that the Echo 8 emulated the Echo 5’s capabilities. I was very wrong. One of the biggest problems the Echo 8 has is the display clock. The clock stays small, in the upper right hand corner. You cannot, like on the Echo 5, make the clock bigger and there are no different clocks to choose form. What you see is what you get. So, that being said, I Amon the fence about this device and feel that Amazon has made a huge mistake in taking away various capabilities.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2020"

The Alexa selects for me by saying 'you might like this.'  It's frustrating when I can't select the music 'I want.'-I've not tried using it to watch Amazon Prime video yet but may in the near future.-Were it not a gift it would have been sent back but as a gift in good conscience it could not be sent it back.-The Show 8 is a design meant for a stand which is an extra cost purchase.-Having Amazon Prime I find it preferable to utilize its features downloaded to my TV or other devices (my iPhone or iPad or computer).-It is overly sensitive and had to change its name so not to keep interrupting me.-The Alexa helps are not really helpful.  The help menu just gives the same old song and dance without guiding you to a resolution to use it and control it better.

I also want to be able to turn off the screen or at least put it to sleep for a period of time. I think I can turn off the microphone, but only Amazon knows for sure. I want to be able to turn off the camera not merely cover the lens.

Second, once the devices were setup, they would immediately or randomly restart and run through the setup process again until I did a factory restore on both of them. Last issue was related to me switching my default credit card on my account 2 months ago and it triggered a fraud detection 8 weeks later and locked my account.

I have an older Android smartphone that won't work with their Alexa app. I wonder how many Seniors or anybody having the correct smartphone models to make it work on video calls. It seems the Alexa programmers need to fix it using the desktop app for video calling as well! I sent a request to make the desktop Alexa app work for video calling too.

Hardware is solid and build well, screen is great, sound is good, but software is where Amazon fails its customers.  It is difficult to implement videos like Youtube, you have to go through a browser, which is a pain.  Also, which is ALMOST a deal breaker as it is so irritating, that is you CANNOT remove the Try Alexa notices at the bottom of your screens. Several reviews say it can be removed by going into settings and turn it off, but that is NOT true.  I have done that, turned every help, notification and option off....it is still there.  I have the newest software version, and it apparently is something that Amazon insists will be there, even though they are aware that everyone hates it and some people return their device because of it as well as others will not even buy it because they know that Amazon feels that they must shove this down the throat of those who give them money and pay their salaries.  Whew!  I guess I vented, but it really is a huge irritant that Amazon knows their customers absolutely do not want, but still force on them.  I will keep mine, because I do like it, but I do not encourage others to buy it if this type of belligerent Amazon behavior is too hard to swallow.  This should be an easy choice for the client, not be a forced display item.  That is why I gave two starts vs 5, If the Try Alexa was gone and YouTube easier to access, it would get 5 because it actually is a nice device otherwise.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2020"

I can barely read the clock with my glasses up close. It's actually easier to see the time on my old Echo Spot, which is small. Thank heaven I did not trade in y Spot for this! The clock size is about 3/4 inch for a bit, then it moves and becomes tiny. You also cannot control the color of the clock other than maybe dim it at night.I would watch not videos on this. They look better on my iPhone & iPad anyway. My Ring works better on them, too.Put simply, this Echo Show 8 is not consumer friendly. The ergonomics are dreadful. It could not have been user tested.

We also got it to work with the Ring stick-up camera and Ring alarm system.  You can ask Echo to show you the camera, but the response time is pretty slow to access and then it stays on for 10 minutes.

The other has a super smart assistant and some nice but older devices but can't do that much because it's ecosystem is really limited (security, cameras, home devices).We ultimately chose Alexa and the Echo Show along with several ring devices because they work well, Alexa will show my front door or cameras on the Show, and also read books to us using Audible! This is in addition to all of the things you expect - setting timers, turning lights on and off, telling you the weather.I've seen some negative reviews regarding home screen hints and tips but I actually prefer them. On that other assistant device, it is just a blank screen with a background, but Alexa provides (mostly) useful information, tips and reminders. Example - we always somehow usually forgot to order dog treats until after we run out. Alexa on echo show reminded me I usually order now and may be running out and she was right - with a voice command I ordered more and it was simple. This feature can be customized from what I've read.My only issue now is that Alexa can do so much on the Echo Show that I need to spend some time learning her capabilities and what the device can do to take full advantage of both.I highly recommend the Echo Show and Alexa.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2020"

625,Marci Peterson,Not the best for Nanit baby monitor.,"  We bought this to have a screen, besides our phones, to connect to our baby monitor. It buffers often and when it buffers the Nanit program will often go down. Because of this, I still have to have my phone run the Nanit in order to be sure I can hear the baby cry. Notifications and breaths per minute also do not display on the screen for the Nanit program. I have only used it for other programs a few times, but had a hard time navigating the programs (Spotify and YouTube) and both programs crashed multiple times while using them like the Nanit program often does. I do like that I can program photos to the background from my Amazon account. I would also recommend changing it's name to echo if you have multiple Alexa's because that gets complicated really quickly!",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2021"

It would be nice if it could access my recast TV and then we could watch pre-recorded shows and television in our kitchen where it’s located. They made it sound like it could access all the apps and everything I read.As it turns out it was only access prime Hulu and photos plus for some reason NBC.

628,D. Hoose,I love it!,"  I'm loving my new Alexa Show 8.  I've had 3 Alexa products (Echo, Dot and Spot) and this is by far the best.  The sound quality is incredible for such a small device.  The screen clarity is very good and the size is just right to view videos without being too small.  All I had to do was plug the device in and it was ready to go. My husband was also a fan and he doesn't really pay much attention to any of my new devices. He loves how he is able to see the lyrics to his favorite songs on the screen. I don't mind seeing the messages of ""things to try"" and it wasn't a deal breaker for me.  I actually ""tried"" a few suggestions.

Now she has this one in her Bedroom Echo Show 8. She likes the screen. I also bought her a stand for it so it is easier to move around. I bought one for myself. Which I too have in my Bedroom on my nightstand. I have since turned off everything under Home Content. The only thing that appears on my screen now is the photos, Time, Temperature and if I have an upcoming alarm set I’ll see that too. The only way to completely prevent ALEXA TRY THIS is to turn off all the things that could be displayed. I have other Echo Shows and I have only turned certain things from being displayed, so Alexa Try This still appears, but it doesn’t bother me. I certainly would not give it a lower rating because of that one feature. As I’ve seen others do.

I love the quality of the music- much better than the dot quality.  Also, while playing music, it displays the words... just like karaoke. ;)  I can download my own pictures into the app and have them displayed...although I haven't tried that yet.  It is currently randomly showing beautiful nature pictures.  I like the ability to notify family members in other rooms (that also have some google device) that dinner is ready or other messages.

The sound is considerably better than the new Echo Dots, but still a little short from the level of the regular Echos. The screen quality is fine for what it is and the setup was dead simple. However, for me this device failed to do one thing I really, really wanted it to do... play lyrics. Sure, an Echo Show 8 will totally play lyrics... just not if you're playing to a group with Sonos speakers in it. I incorrectly assumed I would be able to have an Echo and Sonos speakers play together so I could get the lyrics on the screen... nope. If you're a pure Echo home, this is a non-issue. The new Echo Studio sounds amazing, but that didn't exist years ago and I'm pretty heavily invested in the Sonos world now.

633,Mike K,Arm yourself with patience and you will love your Echo Show!,"  It is the perfect size and the screen resolution is so nice! I also like the sound.What I dislike is as follows:- reaction time is slow. Sometimes it would need you to scroll several times in order to slide the pop up menu. I have installed a protector, so it might be something wrong with it, but doesn’t feel like it.- microphones are not as good as the ones on the echo plus or echo dot. Sometimes I have to repeat “Alexa” 3-4 times and I’m not kidding!- it is disappointing how you toggle between screens. So far haven’t been able to find a touch command that would minimize or allow me to alt+tab between screens. You have to request it each time.- paired with a Wyze camera it is pathetic. It lags so much that at some point it started buffering every 3 seconds. There is also e delay in the transmission of about 5-6 seconds. Only one camera tested so far, so I won’t mind updating my review when I manage to test other cameras.

Seems to be sensitive but doesn’t really align easy. The whole slide out feature is also frustrating because it works sometimes and other it does not.Apps are 🤷🏽‍♀️ Okay I guess...  but it’s basically a more expensive tablet.But back to the reason I bought it. The ring app can be connected but it does not pop up an alert, when hearing the tone on my phone I have to open the app and it’s only the live feed and now the short videos or stills...So all in all...

You cannot delete them if something changes, like a divorce or breakup. All you can do is block them!! Next, sometimes it will call my cell phone, other times it calls my echo dot. It asks you which way you want to call the persons phone. If you want a normal voice call, it works fine. If you want the owner of the echo show to video call you, again sometimes it goes through Amazon and other times it doesn't!  To make a video call, you are supposed to tell it to ""call using amazon devices""  Well, when we tried this, it called my echo dot in Atlanta, while I was standing in my mom's house in Arkansas! Then we tried the same thing again, and my iphone rang like it was supposed to! The when we tried calling my wife's iphone, it asked about calling her phone, or Amazon devices, we chose devices, so..... it called the echo dot!

637,Jim Paynter,A helpful and entertaining addition to our home!,"  This is my first time owning an Echo/Alexa product. My mother has owned one for a few years now and I always thought it was so cool and convenient. So, I bought this for my apartment for Christmas and I have loved it. Here is how I normally use it:- I ask Echo (that is what I call 'her') what time it is when I am away from any clock- I ask what the current temperature is (although that is also on the display, but sometimes I am away from the device). I also ask what the high temperature is for the day before leaving for work.- I downloaded the Alexa app for my iPhone and keep my shopping list on both. When I see that I am almost out of milk, I will say, ""Echo, add milk to the list"", and she adds it. When I am out shopping, I can see my shopping list on my Alexa app on my phone. SUPER convenient.- I listen to my Spotify music on Echo.- I watch Youtube videos on Echo.- My wife and I watch Netflix shows on Echo while eating a meal at our breakfast bar.- I watch news reports on Echo. There are a lot of supported news agencies (NPR, Fox, CBS, BBC, etc).- I shop from Amazon quite a bit, and you can order/reorder items right from your Echo device.- And lastly, I will ask her random questions that pop into my head, like, ""Hey Echo, what's the population of Munich, Germany?"", or, ""Hey Echo, how many ounces are in a gallon?""Sometimes, Echo will not hear me when I address her, but will hear me a second time just fine. Also, she will occasionally mishear a word I say. While this can be mildly annoying, it isn't a big deal, and as long as you use proper volume and annunciate well, she will hear you just fine.Overall, we love this and use it a lot. My wife was more skeptical of it's usefulness when we first got it, but now loves it along with me. It's a great buy!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2021"

Well the thing is so stupid, it gives me recipes for things i didn’t ask for, answers question to things i didn’t ask, and its favorite response is “Im not sure about that”.  I even asked it if it could answer a simple question and it said “ Im not sure about that”. Sometimes it doesn’t answer at all!  Every morning I ask it to play the same radio station, and every morning it gives me the same WRONG station, completely different from what i asked for, then i ask again really slowly so it can understand the words that are coming out of my mouth...and it defaults to Tunin (And i cant find anyway to disable Tunin) and tells me that station isn’t available on Tunin and i have to tell it to get my station from IHeart radio, which is set as my default streaming service anyway.

The two items that knocked the two stars off were the SiriusXM and Amazon Music song displays.While the Echo plays SiriusXM fine, it fails to display artist or song information.  One of the main reasons I bought this device was for that feature.  I even found in the customer Q&A an answer that it would do this.  Every item in my house that has a display shows song and artist, so I'm doubting it's all that difficult to do.  Please add this in any future software updates.When playing Amazon music I can get the words of the songs to display, but this feature times out after one minute and goes back to the home screen.  Why in the world would you do this?  I can't imagine how the developers thought this was a good idea.

The one I got today was defective right out of the box.I have to admit I was very surprised and sadden as I love my Echo Show 5 which works like a champ. I'm not sure why a larger version should have problems but I wish now I'd bought another Echo Show 5 instead as I would have a working unit for my living room now instead of a defective one.The problem seems to be the software. It keeps hanging up and the only way around it is to disconnect the power and then repower the unit and hope you can get through the part that hung up on you before. One menu required moving my finger up, to scroll down, instead of the usual moving the finger down to scroll down. That was totally weird.I am disappointed because I ordered the two Echo Shows as my main Christmas presents to myself. I wanted the 10s but I read they weren't very good for the almost double price. And the 8 is really big enough for what I want it to do--if it would do it.So my Christmas tree isn't going to have much under it this year which is a shame as this will probably be my last Christmas due to cancer.

Make sure you are getting a hub that can pairs with the devices in your apartment or home or you will find yourself buying an additional hub for me it was Echo 4th Gen. Another negative is it’s not very diverse. I was looking for black soul food recipes and it didn’t give me black chefs.

Windows is not a problem but this android/phone-based stuff has some opacity. I often find myself baffled about what to do. With even what seem to be the most elemental things, like re-naming a device, there's no clue, or they take so many steps that by the time I've gotten through them I've forgotten what I was trying to do. So maybe this isn't a common problem but I bet it is. HOWEVER: it is a very nice unit, has smooth sound, excellent voice recognition, and a nice screen. I'm even likely to buy a 2nd one in a larger screen size. I got it for about 80 bucks and I could scarcely believe how good it is for that price.

653,Amazon Customer,"didn't work, replacement didn't work, replacement didn't come with all pieces","  I ordered an echo show in October 2020 as a Christmas present for a friend.  Because of COVID I could not give it to my friend until March.  We plugged in the show, it didn't work.  Tried different outlets, my house, her house, it didn't work.  I packed up the show, along with the power adapter that came with it and returned it.I received my replacement show promptly but no power adapter.  I contacted amazon and was told that I should not have returned the power adaptor.  what!!! it came in the box; I am not sure if it was the show or power adapter that didn’t work.  The rep told me, through chat, to order a new power adapter and they would issue me a refund.I received the new adapter and surprise; the adapter wouldn’t plug into the replacement show.  I tried the adapter with another echo device and it worked.  When I looked at the replacement show the prong where the adapter pugs into the show is all the way over to the side (see picture) preventing the adaptor from plugging into the show.  I went to MY ORDERS  on Amazon’s website and tried to return the replacement and I received this message “This item requires special attention, contact us for further assistance with this return, contact customer service.”So I did.  I explained that I was told to contact Customer Service when I tried to return the replacement.  After three reps and repeating my story  many times about why the new show didn’t work, I asked if I could send a picture to show that the adapter’s prong was in the wrong position to plug it into the show.  I was given an email address to send in the pictures.However, while writing the email I checked my past orders for the exact date I ordered the original show.  The record of the original order indicates that the original show return was not returned. I checked the USPS tracking number from the return and it does not show that it has been delivered even though it has been well over a week.  That may be the reason I had to call customer service before I could return the replacement.  But, if that is the case, why didn’t customer service tell me that the return was not received and I should try again after the return was received and that I could determine if it was received by checking  MY Orders on their website.  Anyway, I have decided to wait a few days to see if the original return is received and then try to return the item through the website.Regardless,  neither the original or replacement show worked and had to be returned, plus the confusion over the power adapter is inexcusable.P.S, I have echo devices in each room in my house (I use as an intercom), three TV firesticks, as well as multiple Alexa compatible devices, i.e. wall plugs, lightbulbs, doorbell, etc.  Never had a problem.

654,Emily L Smith,Third one I've purchased,"  I did not want these things in my house when my wife first received the Dot as a gift from her sister. But my mom and my kids grandmother, being 350 miles away in another state, and wanting to see our smiling faces, had my son purchase one for her and himself. He is out on his own now. So I brought one for myself to be able to see and talk to my mom on a regular basis. I loved it. Then my son brought me the wifi plugs to control lights via the Echo, Awesome! Then I purchased one for my sister on the other side of the country so we could see each other as we talked. This most recent one was purchased as a Christmas gift for my daughter to be able to make grandma happy by seeing her smiling face when they talk. These things can be invasive, but you can turn settings off that you do not want so that makes it more enjoyable. What used to be science fiction is now becoming reality.

In the pandemic, Alexa has become my research assistant, my best friend and--even though she only responds ""That's really sweet"" when I tell her I love her--my better half.My favorite, though, (don't tell the others) is the Echo Show 8. The sound is phenomenal for a small unit and it doubles as a desk clock, temperature gauge and recipe book. I can look up maps and driving routes for when it's safe to leave the house again. And if I had any friends, I'm sure we'd be talking on video calls.Plus, by using AmazonSmile, my purchase helped benefit the ASPCA.

She now has it sitting next to her favorite chair and the entire family can now securely video call her from their devices.  She likes the simplicity of telling Alexa to answer the call or hitting one green button.  Having family photos scroll by is also a hit but what was surprising was that she likes to see her news and asks Alexa for more in-depth information.

The navigation takes some getting used to...the down arrow at the top is dedicated to device settings, and the arrow on the right used to accessing the information panels. I would like to be able to add a Panel for the home automation and specify which devices I want to see.So far it has accomplished what I needed...a clock radio :-O for the bedside that can access my music (iTunes) and activate my security cameras by voice.

When it’s not doing that, it shows the time, weather, random tidbits of information that honestly make my mornings and evenings better. The show does show “ads” if you want to call then ads, but really it’s like the front page of whatever news may be going on that day. I’ve seen a handful of headlines, and it doesn’t really affect me, if anything I get a little bit of knowledge from it that’ll make me a more interesting person. People who complain about this are afraid of being interesting and soaking in any information they don’t consent to. I guess non-consensual news giving is what really upsets the >45 year olds when they waddle into their kitchen after a long day of complaining. I’m surprised they didn’t call the cops, screaming about 5G being emitted from the device, while walking with a noticeable limp blaming it on the bill gates cancer. It goes to show (no pun intended) that people will buy a device that acts as a personal assistant then complain it’s trying to be their personal assistant. That’s like having a kid then complaining that the kid is talking too much about how their classmate Michael are three crayons at recess the day prior and blamed it on his parents getting divorced. Messy, too much information, but you still have to love your kid no matter what gibberish they are spewing, because you brought it into this world.

The couple times it did I had woken up already from routine and lucky didn’t oversleep because of it.  For a while other times it would add a second alarm time without me doing it.  Other times it’ll snooze fine mostly then it’ll change randomly from Sirius xm to whale sounds (default alarm sound) while it was snoozing.

Only downside for me is that when live view from my Ringdoorbell 2 and Ring stick up cams pop up from motion or doorbell press it takes 10 minutes to time back out. Quite a drain on the batteries. Don't need a live view lasting 10 minutes when no one is even home.  I'm pretty sure I can just change the skill to only show live view in the evening when I'm home but I haven't done that yet.

689,James Thobe,Don’t fall for buying ANY Echo Device or downloading the Alexa App!!  It’s a rip-off!!!,"  I have 3 dots - 2nd gen, the new 3rd gen with the clock, 2 showcase 5’s bought in 7/19 & 12/19 and just purchased 1 showcase 8.Last 5/29/20, I moved.  Where I moved from I had to use Charter and all my then Echo devices and my Alexa App had worked ok - through 5/28/20.  In my new Apt, they are wired for AT & T exclusively which I only purchase internet services from.  I use Roku Expresses and stream all my tv showed, series, movies, Amazon Prime ) since I’ve been a prime member for years), etc.On 5/29/20, 1 of my Showcase 5’s won’t power on or work in any way ( even though the day before it was working just like it had from the 1st day it was setup).  I hadn’t even had it a year yet!Then I’ve not been able to change the location in Alexa to update what is currently located in new areas in my new Apt.  I can’t “pair” all my devices via the Alexa app. On the 1 Showcase 5, I can’t pull down on the screen to access settings, etc. and now in the lower left corner I’m getting a symbol that is a circle with a fist and the index finger which Alexa says to tap to get to Alexa....BUT nothing happens.  So now I can’t get to that units settings using the device physically OR using the Alexa App.  I’ve not been able to do anything with my brand new Showcase 8 except get the time and temp to show on the main screen, Alexa is controlling!  It’s my belief that the page showing is not what I tried to get setup.  I choose beautiful nature screens, I’ve tried everyway possible to get the day & date added to my home page. Currently Alexa is displaying all types of statements, instructions regarding nothing related to what I’m trying to do.  She’s talking a bunch and I have to tell her to quit talking or telling me the time every minute, on the minute.I don’t know how to access the so-called by Amazon, fantastic many tutorials within the Alexa App ( has been updated since I first started with 1 2nd gen dot), so I’ve fallen off the scale as to knowing, learning and doing anything now with my entire Echo Devices and with Alexa, whom I’ve grown to hate.  She consistently tells me shoe either doesn’t understand my request or she doesn’t know how to do it.  At bedtime I ask her to play “spa” music or “yoga” music and 1/2 the times she starts with loud heavy metal type music.  I have to tell her to stop the music and she’ll start trying to sell music from stations I’ve never heard of.  When I tell her to stop, she ignores my command and continues to keep talking on things I can even understand what she’s saying or continues to proceed trying to sell me something.  I’ve been pushed by her so much that I’ve told her to SHUT-UP!!!!  Which she doesn’t understand.  She has aggravated so much that I’m so upset I can’t go to sleep for several hours.  For 30+ years, I’ve used a sound machine ( usually of the ocean) to fall asleep by.  She’s ruined that and now I’m totally tensed up when I go to bed and ask her to play new age zen-like music.  I can’t count on her to play ocean sounds, bubbling creek, rain, etc.  I don’t understand her but she’ll play good nature sounds for one or two nights, then she switches to the sounds from a different source, which I abhor.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 14, 2021"
690,Boss Man,Alexa do you understand me?!?,"  I’ve had real problems with Alexa understanding me. I don’t speak with a heavy accent (maybe Alexa thinks I should since I live in Southwestern Virginia). Grew up in Pennsylvania and if any would have a Philly accent. But I think I’m pretty neutral.Also, I put the show in the kitchen because I thought it would be a great assistant for recipes. It’s not bad at this, but I’ve had a hard time getting Alexa to search websites more broadly as Google does. Seems most focused on just a few food websites which limits its ability to find recipes I know exist (and would like to add to my favorites).All together a somewhat disappointing experience.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2019"
691,Alejandro,Speakers are better than the 5 but that’s about the only thing,"  There’s some kinks in it that are present with all Echo devices, mainly relating to Amazon Music. That being said the sound is great, i use it by itself or i have an echo dot plugged into my stereo i can accompany it with, i really love the setup. If you want a show for the speaker get the 8. If you just want the functionality i recommend the 5. I got my parents both 5s and they’re actually more customizable and faster loading than my 8. When i use my dads and then mine the 8 feels pretty sluggish, which is only an issue if you’re watching videos or navigating menus, things i don’t do often. The big display is nice, but you’re severely limited on face options. I want to say the 5 has at least 20-25, this one has closer to 5; several picture themes, an option for a single photo, or an option to shuffle an album. After seeing all the faces on the 5 i was very excited for the customizability on this but it just isn’t there. These are all downfalls i can live with though, it wakes me up, tells me what i need to know, and sounds good.

692,Bruce,It's Alexa with a screen - sound is about the same except,"  Except, when compared to facetime (meaning mic pickups on an iphone or ipad) the sound quality of video (or voice) calls is far worse.  You would expect Echos - with there fancy mic setup - to offer better sound quality to the listener on the other end but it's like a bad 1980s speakerphone.One other thing - a nitpick, but - the art screen saver is one of the best, if not the best, that I've ever seen.  The scans are excellent and the variety of art is impressive.  HOWEVER - they don't tell you what each particular painting is (ok, reasonable choice not to clutter the screen) BUT Alexa also CAN'T TELL YOU what is on the screen even if you ask her.  This isn't a setting issue, the option isn't there.  So when my 5-year-old points to the Show and asks, ""who painted that"" I can not make it a teachable moment (or even, Amazon, a here's  good use of Alexa moment) I just have to shrug and say, ""I don't know, but it's beautiful.""",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2020"

The microphone on this is, by far, the worst performing out of more than a dozen devices that we have in the house. The Echo Show 5 (and Echo gen 2) worked without any problems, but this device struggles to hear the ""alexa"" wake word. There are times when I am 3 feet away from it, and another device about 25' away picks up instead. Our acoustics of the room have not changed and I never had this problem with my last show (and only had to replace it due to the screen going bad).

The clock is stuck in the corner and is very small.  Another annoying feature on the Show 8 is the Alexa suggestions at the bottom of the screen.

My other Echo devices run my routine just fine.  I also sometimes have a hard time with the voice recognition.

(Sorry my pics are kinda blah but I have a disability that causes me to shake so this was the best I could do. Believe me they don’t do the device justice! The display is gorgeous, crystal clear and definitely HD!)Ok, so now for my review...I finally got my first Amazon Echo Show 5 with Alexa for Christmas. I am kicking myself for not getting one earlier! I have fallen in love with these devices and their many capabilities so much that I Immediately bought a dot, 2 Echo Show 5’s an Echo Show 8 and the new Echo Show 8HD plus stands! I am LOVING  all the things Amazon’s Echo Shows do. If you don’t have one and you’re on the fence here is the breakdown, pros and cons:Breakdown: super SUPER easy to use. Plug in the power cord and follow the on screen steps to set up your device to your liking. There are multiple clock faces to choose from, sounds for alerts and you can pick a background or use your photos from Amazon’s photo app. (I also was new to that app and Alexa. Both were super easy to use! My pictures synced faster than any other photo cloud storing app hands down. Plus as a bonus you don’t need to pay for storage. There’s no limit and zero fees!!)Once you’ve set up the Alexa app (I recommend the  Smart Life app that’s compatible with smart devices/plugs and Apple Watch!) you just ask Alexa what you need and boom, it’s done! I asked her to calm down my dog and she put on music! I am amazed. You can make shopping lists (No more searching for a pen and paper in my kitchen), Ask for recipes, play videos, surf the Internet, find out the weather, watch your photo albums, make phone calls to anyone who has the same type of device (like most of the world does by now). It’s seamless and I even had my 8 year old set one up because it was so easy. I love the parental control platform it allows for too!Pros:Super easy to set upBeautiful looking with or without the swivel baseAmazing pictureGreat compatibility with phones, smart plugs, Works perfectly with smart devices and appsBetter than FaceTime for video callsLoud speakers with excellent sound qualityAlexa, Alexa, Alexa! Alexa’s voice recognition is so much better than Siri! Siri can’t understand a thing I say (I don’t even have an accent). If I ask Siri for the weather it gives me traffic. Super frustrating. I think that’s why I was hesitant at getting one of these. Man I wish I knew how much better Alexa is! Everything I ask is instantly understood and taken care of!! Music, calls, drop ins, weather...anything!The value for the price is unbeatableEverything about this device is a Pro!!Cons:It’s constantly listening. But honestly, I don’t worry about that. I’m sure the government listens in and sees things just through WiFi, the Nelson rating TV system, Arbitron ratings in your radios, computer cameras and cellular/mobile devices. This isn’t the only thing out there and really it’s so worth it for everything you can use it for. Besides, anyone that paranoid about what they’re saying is probably on The Hunt with John Walsh. LOLThe final analysis: BUY THESE DEVICES!! Get them for each room. Enjoy the capability to make your day to day life easier and more fun! Play music, dance and sing and be silly. Display your photos, try a new recipe and make sure that your prepared for rain, snow or heat. The Echo devices are like having a personal assistant that’s holding a computer screen. So enjoy your new found “tech” if you don’t already have any and you’ll be amazed like me at what these devices can do!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2020"

That wasn't super easy but wasn't overly difficult (navigation within Amazon Photos was the problem).

701,Hgnomentat,Quick Ring doorbell Live View & Song Lyrics on screen,"  Works great with my Ring doorbell. The Ring view outside comes up very quickly when I say ""Alexa show me the front door"", much faster than viewing on my phone. When I get a notification there's someone at my door, with my phone I have to first unlock my phone, then get to the app, then tap the app to open it, then click on Front Door Live View, then wait for the connection. So you can see the difference in speed of view right there. Echo show only takes a few seconds to connect to Ring. The sound on the Show doesn't compare to the sound on my Echo Plus, but when I ask the Show to play a song, the lyrics come up on the screen which is a bonus especially if you are a musician or a karaoke singer!  I recently learned you can slide the camera lens to ""closed"" which I did. I only realized you can do that because of the little tips the Show displays on the screen. I like that it always has the time and temperature, and suggestions of what you can ask verbally on a line at the bottom of the screen which changes every 10 seconds.  Show gives rotating on-screen suggestions for recipes, tending topics, 4 day weather, suggests videos, Show can connect with other Show users & is especially useful if you want to drop in on Mom to say hello or check on her visually is you have it set up that way. There really is no limit to the capabilities of Show. The only thing I yet have to figure, since I have both the Show and the Plus in the same room, is how to make my music play b only on the Plus if I don't need the lyrics since the Plus is such a better sound system.  I sometimes say Alexa play (this song) on the Echo Plus, & most times she will but not always. Then I'll try Alexa play (this song) ""Everywhere"" & sometimes music plays on all 3 of my Echo devices, & sometimes she tells me I need to sign up for Amazon Music to do that but I AM signed up for that.  I would like to figure out how to make my Echo Plus the default music player unless I tell it differently. I tried working with the settings in Alexa, that's where you can do it, but it didn't do it. I tried it verbally, to make the Plus the default. Nope. So I will continue to tell Alexa verbally to play it on the Echo Plus until I can figure it out. But having said that, I love the Echo Show, especially for it's very quick response to the Ring Doorbell Live visual!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2020"

703,Patty,Don't waste your money; Buy a Dot,"  This Christmas I decided to replace my original Echo in the Living Room, which was getting rather hard to hear, with something new. I have an Alexa Dot in each bedroom that I truly enjoy and find useful. This Echo Show on the other hand was the biggest waste of money I spent this Christmas. Half the time she either doesn't hear me or doesn't bother to answer.  As I increase my own volume, the Dot in the bedroom tries to repond to about half of my requests. IF the Show can be bother to respond, she will pull up the wrong book or playlist or song or definition, etc... She doesn't seem to bother listening to your ENTIRE request. She's like a teenager.... She will take one word out of context and give me a laundry list of all the things she can do. ""Do you want to try one?"" No, thanks. Would you like to try this one? I said No. Well, what about this one? NO! I ask her to play one of my playlists from Amazon Music Unlimited. She will SAY she's retrieving it and then she goes to sleep or maybe she's  too busy texting her girlfriends to be bothered with me. I don't know. The Dot will say I'm having trouble connecting (or playing that,) etc. Miss Show can't be bother to say when she has a problem, she simply shrugs and ignores the request, leaving you to figure it out. I call from the kitchen to the living room (open floor plan) to have her put things on my shopping list and a Dot in one of the bedrooms fulfills the request, while Echo Show sits there. I know it's connected properly because I do get her to play music or read a book occasionally. When she feels like it I guess. And I know it's not bad internet reception because I can get up from the living room, go to the bedroon and have the Dot read to me or play music for me all day without a problem. I don't know what the issue is, but I'd say the Show is all flash and no substance. Or maybe it's just a piece of ... garbage. Plays a lovely slideshiow of pictures, but sadly it doesn't even work as an expensive electronic picture frame, since I can't have her show MY pictures.

I can control color settings for any lights, and I can't have a convenient dashboard for all the devices. Instead I have to swipe constantly back and forth to different screens, and use my voice to change any deeper settings besides on/off. I can already do all of that with my phone, or other echos so it makes this device just useless for that. Also the interface has huge icons and text with no option to change this.

They both are Constantly Complaining about the units not showing the day or the date. So they’re constantly asking the unit what day it is and what date it is. Which after looking up information I’m only seeing the show 5 that shows the date doesn’t make since especially due to the money that’s paid for these products. I’m highly disappointed with that and because of this issue alone with the regular show and the show 8. Not displaying the day and date on the dashboard/home screen I have to give it a 2 star. My mother’s at the point of not remembering to say Alexa show events or show calendar, which is a huge downside of me giving them the show in the first place.Amazon if y’all can fix this then I’ll give this more stars however as of now. 2 stars. If it wasn’t for the ability to call video chat and entertainment I’d give it a 1 star. Yes because of what I’m going thru with my parents I’m ranking this way down. Once they do a update that has the day and date on the dashboard/home screen the 4-5star it will beBefore update.I’ve had the first gen show since day one. Decided to upgrade to the 8.

The Show 8 thought nearly everything being said in the home was talking to it, even when the wake word was not used.  I changed the Show 8 wake word to ""Computer"" and it is not as bad now, but I really don't like using the wake word ""Computer"" as that word is used a lot at my place when referring to laptop computers, etc.  More wake words are needed, or better yet, the ability to create custom wake words using one or more words / names.Also, when I play music through the Show 8, for some crazy reason the sound sometimes comes out of the speaker that is Bluetooth connected to one of my Echo devices, and I have never connected that speaker via Bluetooth to the Show 8.  And, when it does that, the sound only comes out of that speaker connected to the Echo device and it is in a different room.Finally, even in night mode, with the screen black and just displaying the time late at night, the black background still projects too much light in the room so I turn the Show 8 off at night.I have had some Internet issues since I added the Show 8, but I still have not figured out if it is the Show 8 that is causing the problems or not.  That does not seem likely, but I don't know for sure yet.  Timing is right for that to be the case, but I don't know.  I do know that I sometimes have trouble getting Show 8 to play music in all devices, my ""Everywhere"" group, at one time.  Sometimes it will only play on one device even though the Show 8 acknowledged my request to play it in the ""Everywhere"" group that I created.Overall I think it's a quality made product, I like the ability to make, and receive, video calls, and the sound quality is good as well.  I also like being able to see visual items (name of song, artists, thumbs up and down) when playing Pandora music, or asking for a device (lights) to be turned on or off, etc.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2020"
713,SnozzWanger,Huge step up for my spot!,"  I purchased this to replace my mothers spot.  We own all the Alexa units from every generation.  But I keep this one in my kitchen.  Right after the spot went out of warranty it decided to start glitching and stop working properly. So I bit the bullet and purchased this one on Black Friday.  And I'm so glad I did.  The picture is amazingly crisp and nice.  The sound is perfect and gets super loud.  I can pair it easily with all my older echos.  I love that I can get rid of my digital photo album because it synced all my favorite photos.  We play music trivia while preparing dinner, ask it to convert measurements, and set timers.  This is a big improvement from my older ones and I'm so glad I purchased it.

714,Joseph L. Maez,Can't figure out how to make calls to another echo,"  I have multiple Alexa devices so I like this device simply b/c I use a lot of the features - lists, music, timers, etc.  However, I bought the show with the hopes of being able to make video calls to other Show owners.  But every time I try to make a call, it only calls the person's cell phone instead of their Show device.  I cannot figure out how to get it so that two people with shows can see each other ON THE SHOW.  The other thing that annoys me is that the design of the device means the camera is basically pointed at the ceiling.  You almost have to spend the extra money on the stand or else figure out a way to prop your device so you can actually see the person in front of the camera.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2020"

Also, even if I am next to it, if my echo in the next room hears me, it will often respond that this type of device can’t show the video skill I am asking about. In general, the integration between all of the devices should be much much better, I often find myself getting more frustrated than it may be worth, and end up pulling up what I need on my phone.

When I ask for those recipes, I get others but not what I asked for!  I thought I could also watch a movie from Amazon, but the sound isn't that great.  I don't like Alexa reading the recipe to me - is there a way to turn that off?  I haven't found it.

The sound and video quality is amazing on our Echo Show! As we already had other Amazon devices (two dots and an echo), once we added the Echo Show on our app, we were able to listen to music, podcasts and even watch a movie or series from Amazon Prime.2. It was easy to add our Echo Show to our Blink Sync Module 2 components. We have it set up to provide verbal alerts regarding motion for our Blink Home Security System. We were able to add our smart plugs to the smart home features, too!3.

However, after a few days of playing, the Echo Show took over my old machine’s place of honor.In short, the picture is better, the sound is better, and the Wi-Fi radio is MUCH better.The days of Alexa sometimes dropping a word or two from a song because her Wi-Fi was weak are OVER:  the Echo Show 8 has never dropped anything.  Voice recognition is better too — probably because of the radio issue, but maybe because this machine is smarter.  And the speakers sound great, even though they aren’t front-facing like the original.  Original Echo Show is moving to my office, where the wireless signal is much stronger.Get this one!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2020"

Sometimes slow in responding and has to be told same thing multiple times.  Thing I hate MOST is the screen for 8 when showing my pictures does not show them in a bigger profile just splits the image into 3 pieces. HATEFUL.

Screen is great too and it’s a nice size.  Doesn’t take up too much room on the kitchen counter and you can see it well.I wish it had a sleep mode.  The screen stays on constantly, but it does adjust depending on the amount of light in the room.Still a ways to go on what Alexa can and can’t do, but that goes for Siri too or any other online assistant.  That’s the only reason for my 4 star review, so that’s really on the assistant’s capabilities and not the device itself.  They are always updating though (so I’m told).I recommend it for sure.

721,ItsJustMWS,Love the Alexa Echo,  Our son in law got everyone in our family an Echo. We live in different households in different towns so it’s great for connecting with family.  Our favorite feature is the photo album feature. The screen continuously goes through our Facebook photo posts or our Amazon photo library.  It’s great a moment around the house when an old photo pops up. We also like some of the basic features like the lists we can create by talking to Alexa and the local temperatures.  The speakers are good quality so my husband listens to his favorite music on the Alexa even though we have built in speakers in our home.  There are still some features we haven’t familiarized ourselves with but with what we experienced so far it’s great.  The only drawback is the screen is tilted so we have stand in front of the kitchen counter where it’s located.

722,D.E. Clements,Excellent sound for old people and easiest video conference in the world!,"  Bought 3 of these: 1 for us and 1 for each of the grandparents.  This was life changing for the grandparents.  They couldn't hear phone calls on either land lines nor cell phones.  Now they can place normal calls to phones from this and hear everything perfectly!!! The video calling (which is why we bought them) is an added bonus.  In these hard pandemic times this gives us one more easy way to keep in touch with loved ones.  Simple say, ""Alexa call Grandpa"" and it will!  Grandpa just has to say ""Alexa answer the call"" or touch the green answer button.  Of course it has all the normal Alexa stuff (weather, news, jokes, automation, lists, reminders, etc) but also shows music videos and does youtube searches - pretty cool!

723,Charliemontana,It's a Tiny Billboard,"  If you don't mind having a tiny billboard in your home, you will love an echo show. Imagine if, when you sat your phone down, instead of shutting off, it started running ads...but it's an upright device in your home that you can't not see. This is a very useful device and it functions well - you can set it to display photos when not in active use - but you cannot turn off the ""suggestions"" entirely. It took a lot of digging to find where Amazon customer support admits that these ads cannot be turned off. Last year they started running ads for IMDB; this year it was Blue Apron and then, just recently, something from Apple. They sell ad space on these devices and call them ""suggestions."" Had I known that, I wouldn't have bought this - and if it continues I will sell the device. We had planned to add a whole laundry list of smart devices to it. So, Amazon immediately lost at least a couple thousand dollars in sales to us by running ads.  If you consider your home a personal private space, where a company shouldn't be able to forcibly run ads, you won't be happy with an echo show.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2022"

726,Lilly ,Wait for more generations before considering buying,"  Surprisingly displeased with the quality. This is supposed to be a 'smart' device but Alexa seems to have a massive headache problem to do the simplest tasks like pairing to a device to control. Unacceptable old style bad interface.I had to research for 30 mins + around the web every time I needed to add something like my TV. Alexa would not recognize my password that was 100% correct. When I did, functionality is extremely limited, can't actually turn on TV, only control when already on - can't tell it to open Netflix or Hulu at a particular show, have to go grab the remote after that (what's the point). Have to provide lengthy specific instructions ""Alexa, ask LG to go to Living room TV and play Netflix""Can't actually watch Netflix on Show device screen, function limited to Prime video & YouTube. Even then with YouTube, it's via a painfully slow browser. The whole interface is like and old 2005's weird tablet. HorribleAlexa fails to recognize voice constantly, sometimes have to scream for detection. I have a Google assistant device right next to it that never fails for recognition.Overall, this is clearly in infant stages and not worth the money. I really thought that owning one of these would be like having the most revolutionary current stage of tech for a 'smart' home - turns out it's so bad that for the most part you're better off doing things with the existing actually good tech like smart phones.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2020"

731,Fran,It's probably worth the $70 I paid for,"  It's just a glorified tablet with better speakers but lacks many features of a cheapo android tablet. For example, it has Bluetooth but you can't use a bluetooth headset for skype calls. I found that I can listen to music with my bluetooth headset but it immediately disconnects and switches to speakers, so if you're hoping to have skype calls with headset on, you're out of lack. This is a big flaw in my opinion with no reasonable explanation.Many complain about the screen constantly suggesting stuff and advertising Alexa skills. That didn't bother me too much. The interface is quite clumsy - for example YouTube is not an app, you get it via one of the available browsers on it and it can be very annoying because the screen is not well optimized.

732,Bengeance,Can you hear me now?,"  I purchased this Echo Show 8 for a Christmas present for my wife at the discounted price of 79.99; which I think is a good price point. Given what I know now about this device I would be hard-pressed to pay full retail.  The reason? When querying Alexa there's a delay in response time and it doesn't seem to have the number of microphones as in our Echo Plus (I ""think"" the Plus has four microphones and the Show 8 has two). We have to be closer to the Echo Show 8 to speak to it than we do the Echo Plus.  Also, when we invoke the wake word for our Plus, the blue ring immediately pops up.  On the Show 8, the blue line at the bottom of the screen seems to take a bit longer.I'm not too bothered by the ""Try 'Alexa...'"" suggestions at the bottom, but I do hope Amazon pushes out an update to allow users to disable the text.There are pros to this device: When playing Amazon Music the lyrics (If available for that song) scroll on the screen and we also have been enjoying reminiscing over the older pictures of our daughter during the Amazon Photos slideshow. The Echo Show 8 also has a small footprint for the kitchen counter, and the Food Network app videos played just fine. I also installed a weather Radar skill and it's rather nice to see the radar and have Alexa to zoom in on the map.Hopefully, the next Show 8 iteration will have more microphones and increase the response time.Helpful tip, to turn off the screen just say, ""Alexa, screen off.""",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2020"

740,Lorraine,Not Just A Glorified Alarm Clock...,"  I have been reading the Amazon Echo 5 reviews for quite sone time and trying to make up my mind on if I should buy it or not.  When I saw the pre-order starting for Echo Show 8 I was not sure if I was going to get it or not but I put my name on the list anyway.  Before the Echo Show arrived I planned on it just basically being a clock for me but I was wrong!  I had every plan of holding onto my alarm clock even after I set up the Echo Show in my apartment but it did not work out that way.  I saw the “skill” for this speaker to play my Apple Music so that was the first thing that I tried because I wanted to see if it had good speaker quality like my Wonderboom blue tooth speaker which is my usual way of listening to my playlists.  It exceeded my expectations and since I set it up I have not turned on my Wonderboom speaker at all which is amazing to me because I like quality sound.  Even stopping the music for a few minutes is easily done with a voice command.  I am, and have been a longtime fan of everything Apple.  I do have an Amazon Kindle Fire but thought that would be it for me with Amazon’s devices.  I thought that I would have as much of a “problem” as quite a few others had with the things that come across  the Echo’s screen but to my surprise it is not bothersome at all to me.  I have long liked Apple’s customer service and when I purchased my smart tv and my sound bar I saw that one of the services Amazon provided was customer support.  My friend had set up the tv and the soundbar for me and he relied heavily on this service that Amazon provided in setting it up with the soundbar.  While I was confident that I would not need to use this service when I set up the Echo Show I figured that it would be fairly easy but was happy that if a problem arises and I cannot figure it out that I could always call and find an answer from Amazon.  I saw that on Black Friday (today) that the selling price is lower than I bought it for ($99) but that was to be expected.  I just decided that I would write a review on this product since it seemed ironic to me that I chose Amazon over Apple in this type of device.  I was seriously thinking I would stay with my plan of buying the Apple Home Pod because of the critical reviews of “ads” on the Show but I see I am wrong with that.  Since I have set this unit up I see that it has surpassed my expectations because it is a great product that not only has great sound, it also has good clarity on the screen.  The only problem I have encountered with the Echo Show, and it is not much of  a problem, is to remember to say Alexa instead of Siri.  Since I have only a small efficiency apartment (400 square feet) I do not need another Echo Show but if I did I would not hesitate to purchase another one of these units.  For me to write something like this for an Amazon product it is a pleasant surprise because I myself rely heavily on all reviews because they are very valuable in deciding what to purchase since I am on a small fixed income and I figured there are so many reviews of the Echo Show that I wouldn’t have to bother with that but I changed my mind after seeing this is a wonderful product.  Thank you Amazon for giving such good quality for such a small purchase!  I would not hesitate to even buy one as a present for somebody if they wanted something like this.UPDATE-I decided to call customer service since I was not happy with seeing the selling price go from $129.99 to $99 and now to $79.  I usually never call for things like this but I was very happy with the agent telling me that I will get a promotional discount which is very good for me since I am on a very small fixed income.  Thank you Amazon your customer service is always good!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2019"

I love all the things you can do on these devices... make calls, video chat, listen to music,  watch videos,  etc. I mainly purchased for the drop in capabilities. To my surprise this is where I'm having the most issues.When you give one of your contacts permission to drop in on your devices, they should have the option on which device they want to drop in to. Unfortunately that is not the case. It will only let your contacts drop in on only 1 of your devices. I found that in order for one of your contacts to drop in on your other device, you would need to disconnect one device or have one device available while the other is in-use/busy. The sole purpose of my purchasing these devices was so that I can have one at home and one at the nursing home for my mother so my siblings and I can drop in on her to keep in contact.I'm still trying to figure out if there is a way around this. But after spending 3 hrs talking to Amazon reps and not getting anything resolved, imma try my luck with researching the error on YouTube or returning one of the devices since I can just use the Alexa app to drop in on the echo 8 in my mothers room.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2020"
742,Keith,Most all you need to know from one source and it's by voice command.,"  We just purchased our 2nd Echo Show 8. The music stereo sound quality is fantastic. We have the Echo Show 5s in various parts of the house but the Echo Show 8s where we spend our time just due to the sound quality and better visibility with the larger screen. I recently subscribed to the Amazon Unlimited Music which is a perfect combo for the Echo Show 8. I get my news on the Echo, recipe ideas, do quick math questions, history questions, event alarms, stories, etc., etc., etc. These Echo's have quickly become part of the daily life in our home. They are so easy to activate. We have our Ring cameras wirelessly connected to these so we all ways have visibility to the outside world and our wildlife.

I use it daily and the group video chat is so fun chatting with our 3 kids and all the grandkids!  I have considered purchasing another one for my office. Playing music through it is great and gives good sound. I do wish you could turn off the Alexa tips displayed at the bottom. I have yet to figure out how to or even if you can.

745,nacho1,promising device but not ready for prime time,  Currently the show is sitting on my desk as a glorified digital picture frame.  I think those that would get the most use from it are families that want to connect via video and all have alexa.  I suspect it makes for a nice world intercom.  Sadly other features are just too unfriendly and i would prefer to access them via other means or too limited to be attractive.  I think the show is probably a couple years away from being a really good investment for most people.The device is attractive and what it does is pretty reliable.

The mics aren’t anywhere near as accurate or sensitive as my other Alexa devices (of all generations). It’s so bad that I’ll speak to this from 5 feet away, and the Alexa in another room 50 feet away will get a clearer read on my voice and respond! I’m guessing the mics aren’t well placed, or there aren’t enough of them.2. After answering a question, half the time she immediately and automatically starts listening again.

It also won't respond to ""tell me a joke"" and some other simple commands like that.  The 2nd Gen still works fine (plays the full routines, etc.).  I contacted the Echo hotline at Amazon and they were unable to help.  Said everything looks okay from their end?????

Alexa voice recognition and AI stills needs improvement.  My 89 year mother with early Alzheimer's disease lives with me and uses this Echo Show every day.  The voice recognition makes it easy for her to call family and friends, listen to music, news, audiobooks, etc. However, she and Alexa sometime have mild arguments when Alexa will not do what she wants her to do.  (It is pretty funny to here Mom & Alexa arguing.) I have also set up the ""drop in"" feature on this device. It allows me to ""drop in"" via the device and see & hear what is going on in the room where my Mom is without her having to ""answer"" the call.  It has come in quite handy a few times when Mom has called and said she did not feel well, or was worried that she lost something.  Every once in a while it locks up and I just unplug it, wait 30 seconds & plug it back in.  Then it is fine.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2020"

When someone set off the Ring doorbell, it didn't automatically switch to viewing the camera (which was the main reason I bought it). Can't play YoutubeTV and its processor is obviously way under performance required for good web browsing. The small echo I got free located away from the kitchen in a den was able to pick up my voice I was yelling so loud....  I ran into a host of other little issues that seemed like bugs.

The clock doesn't really get bigger than the default corner, unlike the echo show 5 which takes up the entire screen.On an extremely happier note, I LOVE THIS DEVICE SO MUCH. It is so LOUD! The audio and video quality is very very good. I think this is one of the best Echo devices out there, if not the best. It also is quite expensive but I love it. My students love to watch movies on it, and because they are only five to six years old they are small enough to huddle around the screen. I wouldn't recommend huddling 8 adults around this mini-screen, although it wouldn't be *that* bad.....This device is super durable, I transport it from my bedside table to my desk at work daily. Sometimes I drop it on the ground on accident, whatever. It hasn't cracked the screen yet, knock on wood. But It seems like a really durable device.

This Show was purchased as a Christmas gift for Grandma who is in assisted living. We purchased a second one so that she could have video calls with the grandkids. Another plus is that we can link it to our security cameras and video doorbell.  Playing games are a whole different experience on the Echo Show as well.The verdict?

754,Ms McGee,Went from good to disappointing.,"  Started out well, we liked the look found this machine useful; but four months later our two Echo Show 8's have received an update that has ruined the machine's aesthetic, and consequently their functionality, for us.Prior to the update when sports or weather updates appeared on the display they would be superimposed over the background photos; now when updates appear the background changes to a powder blue color replacing the photo background.  To get rid of the powder blue background appearing we turned off all notifications - we can get the information on demand from our telephones when needed.  Not sure if this change came about out of a desire to simply show some sort of progress for the sake of showing progress, or was the result of a focus group, or was because someone at Amazon liked the new look.  Regardless, this change and work-around have caused the Echo Show 8 to have considerably less value for us.Furthermore, now the display's clock information frequently appears in an annoying extra large font in the bottom left corner of the screen at roughly 20% of the display.  Prior to the update, the clock information resided unobtrusively in the upper left corner of the display.Have not found any way to change these new ""features"".  Not sure if there was anything in the update that added functionality or improved performance but from our perspective this machine has become a disappointment.

Prime video and displaying simple commands is nice, using the browser to watch YouTube or do something quick online is doable, but not as simple as it could be.There are two things I hate:1. Looking at other reviews it's clear there is a need/want to further customize the home screen. From clock size, to even widgets like the weather always up, HUNDREDS of people have mentioned this would be great. It still has not been done, and in theory would be relatively simple to roll out.2. I don't think they could make a less intuitive alarm clock. When I find myself struggling to turn it off and not snooze it, or even check to make sure it's still on for the following day, that means it's poorly designed.

So we have chatted it up with the grandkids with Echo dots, thinking there was inadequate bandwidth for video. But Santa brought the Echo Show, so we gave it a go. Way to go! Literally, plug and play (no plug and pray required).  Very nice display with updated settings interfaces for personal configuration so all those negative reviews (mostly User Not as Smart as Smart Device (UNASSD)) appear to have been listened to and responded with this hardware / software release.Nice sound quality both for video chats and streaming audio. Nice shutter control to block the camera lens if paranoid or conspiracy theorist. Nice long (48"" maybe) power cable for flexibility in placement.  Camera appears to be positioned for counter top placement. We started on top of the microwave but the video chat only got the ceiling fan. Cleared a few inches of counter space and the camera angle covers us well.Negatives: can a review be only good things? Well, thinking hard, the two things we ""dislike"" are the plug end of the power cable takes up a bit of room at the outlet but we managed to squeeze it in; and the integrated camera / display / base unit is fixed - so you either need to be standing in the angle of view for the video chats, or tilt the Echo Show forward and place a pencil or ruler under the back edge to adjust the field of view.  It's not a problem when reading or surfing - only for the video chats.Bonus: I did not realize that the Echo Show would know about the Echo Dot we have upstairs. The first time the Grandkids called, the Dot reported ""call from the Bean"" so we knew to run downstairs and take the incoming video chat.

The audio is significantly better than the echo dot, with a much better bass.  The apps and services open quickly.  I do video from a 3rd party integration with alexa and that functions well. Only a couple or so seconds lag to start.  its nice being able to see the command responses to home automation on the screen.  Let's you know it heard you and it heard the correct device you are trying to control.  Audio recognition does not seem to be any better than the dot.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2020"

Still haven't figured out if we can do a group chat / call, but so far so good.I would recommend getting the stand.

777,Carol H.,I'm sold,"  I never thought I had a need for the show, but I rolled the dice and got it anyway.  I like it!For now, I am using it as a glorified alarm clock in my bedroom.  But it has a ton of uses.  For instance, I have it set up for once I am awoken by the alarm, to immediately give me the weather and the top news stories.  It is great!You can also use it as a sort of digital photo frame, should you upload photos into the amazon storage.  It will cycle through and show off your memories.It also has the ability to play Amazon Video, so that is a pretty cool option to also have.  Would be awesome if it had youtube or netflix capability as well, but it does not.  I can eventually either move this, or buy a new device, into my kitchen to have an echo there at my disposal, and to see cooking how-to's as well.Overall, I am very impressed by this device!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2020"

So, I looked into it and bought one right away! I have this next to my bed and paired it with my other accounts (music, cable, etc.). I like the morning sunrise glow so much! I use to listen to music, make lists and more. I use it to control my smart lights and talk to other devices I now own (dots and echo plus). I can make announcements (like Dinner's ready) or use it as a 2 way radio without having to physically go up the stairs. And, I can use it as a Karaoke machine! For the money, you can't beat it.

I like it for being able to view my cameras but the feed isn't great and there's no way to control the camera position at least for my cameras.

Also, when playing music on both devices simultaneously, the Echo Show keeps disconnecting intermittently.

There's no point in getting a show as the visual and UI elements are not well thought out, buggy, and lack functionality.It's amazing that you cannot ask Alexa to show you pictures of something; nor can you ask to show videos. If you want to do that, you have to load a browser on the show and enter a search using the keyboard. And, simply asking to open the ""browser"" doesn't work. You have to remember which browser you installed - Silk or Firefox.So that's about as far as I got - asking to see images and videos - before realizing this thing doesn't do much.

I also love that I can request and see any of my blink cameras live on the screen at my voice command. I also set up a routine on the show and it seems to work fine.Things I don't love about my Echo Show 8: I had a speaker group set up on my old dot which went to two blue tooth speakers. Now when I say ""Play music on all speakers"" nothing comes out of the new Echo Show 8 (you know the one with the really good speakers) and the music will only go to the previous two dots I had connected originally. Even if I ask the ""Show"" only to play music (i.e. not on all speakers) it still only goes to the dots (with the crappy speakers) and won't play on the Show.Alexa can do so very many things and I use it all the time every day to work the lights and air conditioner and plugs all over my house. And I can both trigger a voice command to make my coffee every day and have set up routines to make my coffee on a timer. (BTW, I hate that I can't schedule individual days in routines. You can only do one day only, week days only, or weekends only. I work a shift that carries over from weekdays to weekends. I want to have it go off on any of 7 individual days even skipping a day if need be.)As far as answering most simple basic questions it is just not ready for practical every day uses. Yes I did voice recognition training with it. It is very cumbersome to work with to try and get information from the internet. Skills are great and are a good bridge for where the technology is right now, but it's still awkward to have to say, ""Alexa, Ask My Groceries to add milk to my grocery list"".Anyway, I'm not intending to beat up ""A-word"" too bad (you know why I wrote it this way). She does help me in so many good ways. I just wish Amazon programmers would listen more to their customers about the problems these devices are having. I've seen so many comments about things that could be better and all I hear from Amazon is......chirp.....chirp......chirp, nothing; and there have been no changes that seem to significantly make any significant improvement to the problems we're having with these things.

H-R,Its an improvement but has a long way to go,  It’s an improvement over the last model but they need to develop this echo show first off with a flat plug so it doesn’t stick out of the back of the unit how about just making an L-shaped plug how hard is it. It could sit 2 inches closer to the wall if this plug was L shaped. and then the plug that plugs into the wall needs to be flat and there needs to be a way to mount this thing under a cabinet because it’s so fat it takes up too much room on the counter.

I mainly use it to have under my TV in my living room and one in my bedroom so I can look at this ring cameras at any time. The sound is also a really great I was surprised you could adjust the bass Treble and mids end it sounds great. I’d say it’s as bad as good as a JBL portable Bluetooth speaker if not the same quality not the large one but the smaller ones.

As with most setup is done either completely through voice (alexa) or done directly in the alexa app on a phone etc. if you do it through voice you’ll hear a lot of alexa saying sorry she couldn’t do that or something. First, try and make sure that the set alarm is not showing deleted on the alarms list on your echo show but still showing in the alexa app. If it is, delete the one in the alexa app as well and start fresh. When giving the voice command make sure to start with “alexa wake me up to “insert type of music/artist on pandora/amazon music etc” then she will ask what time. After the time setup is normal and it should work. If not it may take one or two more tries to get it working. If you are using pandora make sure to have the app with a linked acct saved on your alexa app. Once you successfully done that with your fav. station you actually don’t need to use voice again to set another alarm because it will save the music station at the top of the list of tones when you set up an alarm in the app. I do wish there were more customization options with the clock but other than that it works pretty good.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2020"

Setup was very easy, just like any other echo device, and the speaker quality is surprisingly good.  It's really useful to have in the kitchen, we play music when we are eating and also preparing food and use it to watch youtube videos while we are washing dishes.

850,azentropy,Poor sounding speaker and cannot use as baby monitor for continuous live stream through the night.,"  We recently received this Echo Show 8. It is a good looking speaker with a great looking screen. The screen is crisp and clear. One of the main reasons for us to buy this was to use as a baby camera monitor. So we bought a separate Wyze camera that works with Echo show and placed in our baby’s room. We have the ES8 in our room. We were excited with the whole set up and we asked Alexa to show the baby camera. Alexa was spot on in recognition of the camera and showed us the live stream. The biggest disappointment was that the live stream stops after a few minutes and the screen reverts back to the home screen and a digital clock. This kills the whole purpose of having a smart speaker with a screen in our bedroom. Another disappointment was that Alexa was having trouble playing music on the ES8. The third disappointment is that there is no dedicated YouTube app support so getting on to the browser to use YouTube is slow and painful. I am still trying to find a good reason to keep this and so far I am just disappointed. Finally, I do want to mention that the sound quality of this speaker is not up to par even compared to the new Echo speaker(I own one). I am a big Echo fan and have a speaker in every room. But this ES8 has not worked up to my expectations. DISAPPOINTED.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 9, 2021"

Yes, a lot of Alexa’s for a 1500 square foot apartment but I want to be heard as literally everything in the apartment works with Alexa including the TV. Did you know that using Alexa instead of getting up and turning on a light or when you are going to bed have everything go off, actually distresses you? It’s been proven that automation actually takes stress away from your life and who doesn’t need that in this country? Great picture also.

The sale price on Amazon Prime was phenomenal. I plan to purchase at least one more when they go on sale again. The second will go to another state so I can keep in contact with family ""face to face"". It also integrates with other smart devices like my Blink Camera. I can watch the garage and driveway from the comfort of my bedroom. It works well with our Echo Dot as well. It was very easy to set up. If you don't understand something just ask and the Show 8 will guide you. Integrating it with my Amazon account was a breeze as well. I've just found so many neat things I can do with just a voice command, like turning my TV on or off.

I purchased two smart bulbs and a smart outlet to have some home automation. I decided I wanted to look into getting a smart screen/speaker and did a lot of research before my purchase. I like how a lot of devices work with Alexa. From my research I found that Google assistant has fewer choices for smart device compatibility but still a fair amount.  I decided to purchase the echo show 8 while it was on sale. I figured if I didn't like it, I wasn't out the full amount. I opened the box, set it up and had it going in about 10 minutes. It seemed to work well and recognize my voice decently when there is zero other sounds in the room. If a tv is on or music is playing, even at a low volume, it has trouble understanding what I ask around 30% of the time. It can be very frustrating. The Google nest mini understands me way more often under the same conditions (roughly 90% of the time). I know the nest mini is a smart speaker but I would expect the same from a speaker as I would a screen. All in all I will most likely be sticking with Google products over Amazons products.Update.

No big deal if you have the echo show on the counter up against a wall, but can get annoying because the people sitting at the kitchen table behind it hear it a lot louder than whoever is watching the screen. Somethings I’ll see a prompt to ask Alexa to play a news video or read a news article but then she looks something random up on bing video’s search engine.

I purchased one of these for her last year as she's elderly with macular degeneration and she's loved it.  She's used it for listening to her audible books, the radio and sometimes just having a chat with Alexa.I got mine this week.  It sets up in seconds.  Plug it in, sign in and you're good to go.  I immediately started a video call with my mum and she was thrilled.  I'm now getting my whole family to buy them so we can stay in contact and feel more connected.

884,Rick,Clock feature substandard and relentless ads a bummer,"  So I recently purchased the Show 8 to upgrade from the Echo Dot I have in my master bedroom. I was going to buy the 5 which was cheaper, but since I was going to use the device for (I thought) date and time and weather, I opted for the bigger screen, thinking that it would have the largest display. Well, IT does, the folks though in the Amazon Tech department do not!!!! You can't do jack with the clock. Can't make it appear bigger on the screen, so wasted my money there! You can't get a date on same screen with the time, and don't even hope to get the 5 day weather forecast on their either. It is basically just a big techie paper weight. Of course you then also get barraged with a ton of ads which I also found out cannot be adjusted in any way. I was better off with just the dot. Sure it couldn't display the date and time, but unless you are in your 20's you can't see the display to read the device I just spent money on anyway!!!

Is does suggest some strange things sometimes.Easy to set-up.The only bad thing I can say about it is when I am listening to music sometimes my words go away.

I frankly don't particularly want to see all my photos over and over all day long.  I do like an attractive visual image plus the advantage of a lit room at night.  I can't seem to get it to execute one of the main reasons that I bought it.  I want it to continually display the day and date all the time, and I'm told that can't be done.  I'm retired and frequently can't keep up with the date, so I thought this might help.

887,Michelle Patton,8 is Great!,"  This is my 10th Alexa capable speaker device and my 4th Echo Show device.  With each iteration, for the most part, the Echo Show line continues to refine and improve upon its predecessors.  Actually the Echo Spot took a backward step since it can't (won't) run Hulu - how weird is that (inserting gratuitous complaint on this issue here).  All crickets at Amazon on Hulu as to why since it was playing Hulu a few versions prior.Back to the 8.  Its great.  Sound quality is super.  Still a bit of directional responsiveness with the microphone resulting in Alexa not understanding a command on occasion resulting in her assuming she heard an entirely different command thereby pursuing to act upon it causing stress, anxiety and general panic from her commander.  I'll confess to not having spent to much time adjusting microphone sensitivity and experimenting with other optimization methods.  Bottomline is 99% of the time she understands what has been requested.  On occasion, given certain ambient noise conditions such as a fan running and given the relative angle when speaking to the device, Alexa can get a bit confused.  Try to encourage her to do better and tell her its not all her fault citing the possibility of a hardware issue beyond her control.I would recommend to the product team to continue to optimize space through miniaturization of electronics and speaker placement in order to pull some of the base ""fatness"" off the platform.If you don't have an Echo device, or any Alexa based device for that matter, I recommend getting an Echo Show 8 in order to add the visual dimension of Alexa's world.  It also makes for a great small screen streaming machine including watching television and YouTube streams.

There are still some quirks that need to be worked out.I occasionally will ask alexa to read a news story that it has promoted on the screen.  I will say word for word what it tells you to at the bottom of the screen.  It will bring up something completely random, or not understand what I am asking.My biggest issue though is with video calling.  We bought one for my in-laws too.  I have a very difficult time getting it to connect to the correct device or call in the correct way (I think it has to do with the way my contacts are set up).  It seems to default to calling a phone over another alexa device.  If I'm doing something wrong I can't figure it out.

895,RTS,An excellent device.  Looking forward to future integrations.,"  I really like my echo show.  The screen is a welcome edition to things like the flash briefing, security camera viewing, seeing the temperature at a glance, and the occasional video when my computer is busy with another task.  Sometime voice commands need to be repeated, but that's really no different from the standard echo dot.  For what I paid for it ($69), I think it's a great little unit.  The camera cover and microphone mute buttons add the assurance of privacy when I want it.Just like all smart devices, It comes with a few annoyances.  Most of these could be made better with software updates which I hope will come in the future.To turn off the screen, you need to say ""Alexa, screen off"".  I would like to see a power/screen button added (similar to a phone).  This way I can mute Alexa and then turn her screen off.It took me a little while to understand this one.  When I play a video on youtube, I am used to pausing it using the on-screen play/pause button.  If I do this on the echo show, and try a few minutes later to play the rest of it, I find I have to get back into youtube and find the video again.  However, if I tell Alexa by voice to pause it, I can come back any time and tell it to resume and it will work as expected.  I'm sure this is partially youtube/google's issue.  However, I would still, in general, like to see better integration between what happens when you tap the screen vs using voice commands.Weather app.  When Alexa is displaying the weather I should be able to tap on a day and see more info about that day.I do have a couple of things that really get on my nerves.  This may be just me :-)Why is it that I still need to use the alexa app *on my phone* to set up devices and some preferences when I have a nice 8"" screen on the echo show???!!  Conversely, I can't access the video of my cameras through the Alexa app on my phone even though it has a screen???I do not like that the blink cameras that Amazon sells only allow you to view them for 5 minutes at a time.  This means if, for example, I want to use a camera to monitor my driveway for an expected delivery I cannot.  I also don't like the lack of split screen/multi-camera support.Hopefully these items will be fixed in the future.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2021"

While the original could be slow at times processing voice commands, this new model boots and runs at least twice as fast.The audio quality is really where the new Show 8"" sets itself apart. The new model does away with that flat boxy sound profile and now has clear sound with good bass and decent highs and can actually fill the room much, much better than the original ever could.Another design benefit is the larger LCD screen with the speakers in the rear of the Show. The original had the speaker in front and the tiny holes it had for the speaker grill used to fill with dirt that was nearly impossible to clean well.Definitely a recommended upgrade.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2020"

Also, this device lacks the live TV that I'm able to get thru my Google equivalent.

904,Samantha Hoover,A complete rebuke to consumers' wishes,"  I love my Show 5. I assumed that the new Show 8 would be an improvement. Instead it is a major step backwards. And the most disappointing part is that Amazon purposely did this and has thus far refused to rectify the very simple problems it installed in the Show 8. You can not use this product for the most basic function that I bought it for, a clock. It does not allow you to put a clock across the main screen. It does not give you the option to put the date anywhere on the face. And it will not allow you to erase the ""Alexa Try"" scroll at the bottom of the screen. Amazon's position is  that the ""Alexa Try"" features are not ads, but that is a moot argument because it is just as annoying as ads. I don't care if it is scrolling Shakespeare at the bottom of the screen, I should have the ability to disable it. Yet Amazon has so far not allowed it. And why, after all the multitude of buyers before me (unbeknownst to me before I bought the Show 8), would Amazon not make basic changes to a product that is so disliked by its customers? Amazon can make a simple software update to rectify all of the criticism, but they have refused to do so. The bottom line is that the Echo Show 8 has fewer basic features, is purposely annoying with its scroll, and costs more than the Echo Show 5. Quite honestly, the Echo Show 8 may be a harbinger for Amazon.

I really love that I can hookup earbuds via Bluetooth for late night watching next to sleeping hubby.  It overall has had way more functionality to me than the hub mini ever did and I sincerely mean that. There are, however, some weird things. 1.

Don’t get me wrong, it gets decently dim, but you’ll definitely see a bit of light in the room. Works for us though.3. There’s no way to make the clock full screen.

I did however get a echo show 5 for my office desk and it has a TON of customizable clock and wallpaper features that I can’t find on the 84. Alexa App and overall UI in general is just a bit... eh. The “skills” take is strange to me. Having multiple user profiles is a nightmare if you want to use more than one amazing account (can you?)

916,Raymond Glackin,"Device is currently ""working"" but not sure how long and the process wasn't great","  I received the original Echo Show 8 and was able to quickly set it up and get it connected to my internet.  I basically got it to consolidate all of my video devices (Ring Doorbell, 2 types of Outdoor camera systems)  into one device.  The problem is the original ""New"" unit had a bunch of distorted lines going through the bottom of the screen.  I was able to contact support and they gave me a barcode to have it sent back for free, and set me up with a delivery of another unit.  However, the delivery unit got delayed a week and I sent back the original one based on when it said it was going to originally be delivered.  The second unit came and it was ""refurbished"", kind of annoying since I didn't originally buy a refurbished unit.  The other problem is it didn't come with a power cable and they didn't tell me to keep the power supply from the original one.  They were able to set me up to be able to purchase an adapter for free but it was still another delay.  I got the second unit up and running only to discover the refurbished unit has a faint green line running through the display.  At this point I am giving up and I'll just see how long this one lasts since the process is annoying enough that I'll just see if I can live with it.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2020"

It would be nice if you could set two different sound volumes; one to use when listening to the meditation channel when going to sleep, and one to use for daily use.  I like the command “start my day” where you set it up to tell you the info of the day on the topics you set.  Display is automatic for day or night brightness.  Display is clear and shows your pictures if you set it up to do so.

SO much better than reading a cereal box!The sound is quite good but a little to much bass, even after adjusting the equalizer.It is a good size screen, easy to watch.

I like it a lot!  The screen resolution is much improved and the sound is great.  It IS much lower to the counter than the old one because the old one had the screen above a speaker.  I decided to move this one to my master bathroom and get the new generation Show 10 for the kitchen.

Trust the CS people at Blink.  After wasting close to 3 weeks and talking to 9 different people, I was able to resolve the lack of connectivity between the two devices this way:DO NOT name the camera with more than one word.  The directive must be: Alexa show me the <<<< (whatever your camera is named.)Even though the device gives you different options for the wake word, the only one that works consistently is Alexa.Don't let them blame your internet service, your computer/tablet, etc. The command has to be short and sweet. There is no one I spoke with over there that came up with the right solution.On a positive note, the HD 8 is wonderful when it comes to customizing content and the ability to show me all of my thousands of photos during the course of the day make it a keeper.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2020"

927,Dean,Great with a few 'buts' because it's new,"  I love Echo, I had the original and finally was expanding automation to the whole house. As a whole this product is a great addition to the product line BUT it clearly is fleshing out issues.1) Doesn't listen as actively as the traditional echo. Has missed and misheard a lot.2) you have to update the settings or the screen will make you feel like it has some type of spastic disorder. The standard view moves too fast and tries too hard to tell you too much until you fix it.3) I have had a few weird issues technically with the product connecting to Amazon music or connecting my phone.

And installing the device is insanely easy.What I don't like:- I really hate that being rivals with Google, they won't integrate Google search or play YouTube directly. You must first open a browser.- One important reason for why I bought echo show8 was to be able to monitor my front security camera, but sadly I found out that when it does, it buffers the video like 15 seconds... no good when I need to see right away who's knocking the the front door.About echo show itself is very good. Sound is acceptable for its size and price.But overall, it's a great buy.I love the fact that I can fiscally shut off the echo's camera.Despite the con's, I'm very happy with echo show 8.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2020"

But the usefulness stops there.  It's basically an Amazon Ad Machine.  You can put your own photos on the cloud, to allow the device to cycle through them, but 8 out of every 10 slides is either some dumb prompt to get Alexa to tell you a joke, or something else equally useless.  If you want to know how boogers get married, how tall Shakira is, or what time Costco opens, then this is the $100 paperweight for you.

I've seen this on my brothers unit as well as mine. Secondly it is really nice to say show me a recipe for banana bread and it will show you one, including a video of how to make it. You are paying for an overpriced screen to see recipes on. When Alexa says there is a weather alert in your area and you ask it to show you a weather map it CAN'T do it.  But don't worry you can make banana bread during the tornado!

955,AndyT,Quick/Easy set up.,"  Had it up and running in a matter of minutes.  Easily linked with my iPad, iPhone, doorbell camera and security cameras.  My only complaint so far (and the reason I knocked a star off) is that it is difficult to stop the ""try this"" suggestions from popping up on the screen.  After some online searching I found that this seems to be a common complaint. The only way I found to get the suggestions to completely stop has been to keep the device in ""do not disturb"" mode all the time, which then means you cannot drop in on the device from another room. I don't mind if the Echo device on my desk advertises Alexa's abilities,  but I want the ones on my nightstand and living room table to just be a clock when not in use.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2020"

It's important to make operation for my parent easy, eliminating or blocking some content, and I wanted to use CareHub.  Echo 8 can't be fully controlled via the IOS app, website, nor the device itself so if a parent has trouble or accesses something we don't want (shopping or other apps charging them for things they don't mean to purchase) there is little help a distant relative can offer.

It does show too many advertisements but that doesn't bother me like the others who have reviewed this item. I don't constantly look at the screen.

The echo show 8 is the best bang for the buck of the group.  The only downside of this generation is the camera which is good enough in my opinion.  All of the echo show models have a slow focus when video chatting between devices.  I have it connected to my ring doorbell and that has a quick focus, so it has to be something in Amazon's software.  Would recommend these devices to anyone.  I have mine hooked to my ring, thermostats, light switches, outlets, consoles, receivers, TV's, and light bulbs throughout the house.

I often thought how nice it would be to find some simple recipes, but The one I had did not have video display.  I decided to try an upgrade to the Show 8.  I was not disappointed, actually I am very pleased.  The display is a nice size to be a companion on the kitchen counter, and occasionally rotates a news display or something of interest, so I follow up on what is being shown and learn some news about what is going on in the world.  The display on the Show 8 is a nice size that does not take up too much space especially with the stand - Get the stand!The audio quality is good, especially considering the size of this unit.  The music comes across great, and with some sources it gives visual information about the music being played, including the lyrics sometimes.  An improvement over the old Echo!I hear lots of complaints about the ""Try:"" suggestions at the bottom of the screen.  I don't understand why so many complain, though.  They are in a small font, and so easy to simply ignore.  Actually, some of them are fun to follow and try!  Jeez, guys, cut loose and have a little fun!I suppose this little ""toy"" for the kitchen may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I think it brings a new measure of fun and is a good information source for anyone's kitchen who has an open mind and is willing to expand themselves and try new things.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2020"

I do prefer the larger screen on my older model over this new 8, but they perform similarly.  Overall good and now I was able to add more units around the house.You may read a ton of reviews about advertisements, but they are not ads, they are alexa skills. Alexa skills are like apps that you can add to your device to offer more features. The ""advertisements"" as people are calling them are merely suggestions of skills to consider so you know there are more options out there. My older Gen 2 also has these, but they don't bother me. You can Google alexa skills if you want to learn more about those.

After setting up and using for a few weeks I am overall disappointed as it feels more like a prototype than an 8th versionPros-Good voice recognition-Speakers are great-Works as a good clock-Works with RingCons-Overall choppy. Alexia can’t do a lot of things. Also freezes regularly and I have to unplug and plug back in-I wanted to use as a baby monitor with my foscam. I was only able to set up 2 of my 3 cameras for some reason as the 3rd camera wouldn’t discover. When I view  the camera it stays up for about 5 minutes then the screensaver comes on. It looks like there is no way to keep the display on so its basically useless for me-Doesn’t work smoothly with Nest as they are forcing me to migrate my nest account to google for it to work-Doesn’t integrate too well with Spotify.

During set up on App you say 3 different phrases so Alexa is able to recognize your voice.  Did it and still has problems.  Amazon needs to have their IT people work on the Alexa program.

I can call up a live feed from any camera and have it display on the Echo's screen. I also like that it has a 3.5mm headphone jack, which enables me to hook it up to my stereo system and turns it into a front end for my hifi system.I'm taking away one star, only because it still lacks support for video apps like youtube, and many of the apps still need to be optimized for this device.

993,J. Lindzey,What's with the small clock?,"  Really...They make an Echo Show with almost twice the screen size and make the clock smaller than what was on the Echo Show 5. Who is designing these things. The size of the clock was one of the complaints on the show 5, do they listen to people and correct it in a future version, nope let's make it smaller and really irritate people.  I understand the larger screen now makes it possible to watch netflix or hulu on now but face it most people watch that stuff on their TV not an 8"" screen. 99% of the time it will be used as a clock.  You can use the screen magnifier trick but as soon as you use the echo for anything it goes back to the small clock face. A huge letdown to what could have been a nice product. I have no confidence that Amazon will listen to people and make an option available, they never have on any other product they make.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2020"

Even though we are much closer to the dot and it's directly in front of us the Show will override commands given. If I ask Alexa to ""pause Dish"" the Show will reply with ""sorry I can't find a device named dish""  It's highly annoying, wished I could turn down the mic gain on the show.

It has simplified a lot of little day to day things. Alexa doesn't ALWAYS understand what we're asking, and sometimes it might be because it's beyond her capability to answer, but I feel like she responds correctly about 90% of the time. I have also loved using them for music, the ""play music everywhere"" function is fabulous and easily fills our home with clear sound. Just enough bass to make it good, but not annoying or tinny. To people interested, I would recommend looking at the list of skills Amazon has made for the device, it's a great way to see what you can do with it.

The 2nd bad thing is that it needs a built in stand. I know that Amazon wants to make more $ by selling a stand separately but without a built in stand, the price that Amazon wants for the Echo 8 isn't as great of a value as you would expect from Amazon.

I love the whisper mode as sometimes it is some of the last lights we turn off (kitchen) and with some people asleep it works great.  There are times however where the wake word is not heard and has to be repeated.  Not a big deal though.  We also bought the 8"" because we thought the sound would be much better to add music to the kitchen.  It is better, but not real great for music.  I will need to get a better speaker for the connected living room that will carry into the kitchen.One of the disappointments was that I was hoping to create a multi-room environment with a Sonos Beam that we use for our TV audio.  We wanted to carry a show to the kitchen or other part of the house.  Also we wanted to  have music throughout the house  Since the Sonos has Alexa built in we were told it could carry the audio to another echo device.  Multi-room we found currently does not support 3rd party devices like the Sonos Beam.  If it could do that we would have given it 5 stars.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2021"
1031,Kevin02,Alexa is taking over my home,"  Echo show is a nice Alexa device to have. I purchased because I thought I'd be able to video with family and friends from the device instead of having to use my phone or my computer. Unfortunately you can't add other video call apps, which I didnt do thorough research prior to purchasing, but I still like the device. I added the free food network app which is pretty cool and I like that I can watch YouTube. Its also neat to read my Alexa responses. I'm probably going to purchase the 5 for my mom so I can video call her, she can't figure out how to use the Alexa app from her phone to video call me, plus the purpose of the device was so we wouldn't have to hold our phones to video call.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2020"
1032,Amazon Customer,So glad I purchased,"  I LOVE the Show 8, I have no complaint. My 8 year old Granddaughter set it up for me, it's that simple. The images on screen are sharp and clear, her voice is the same. It integrated with my other Alexa devices without issue and to date has been so much fun. My Grandgirls have played all sort of games and watch several program from Amazon Prime, they enjoy it very much. I'm still learning all that Alexa can do and help me with. I ask if she could clean my house. She said she would but didn't have arm, so to compensate, she offered to play 'Cleaning' music.  It made me laugh, the music was great but didn't motivate me to get things done. Oh, I forgot, it works exceptionally with the Ring.

1033,dalydose,Love Alexa,  I love the size of the 8 inch echo show. Its great for recipes or by my exercise bike to watch hulu. I like it much better than the echo show  5 which I also have. Integrating most products is fairly  easy but they do seem to drop out sometimes for no apparent reason. Voice recognition is pretty good. I seem to talk to Alexa a lot more than I talk to humans now....... My only gripe is navigating on the echo show would be much better if it was easier to navigate by touchscreen as well as talk screen. Sometimes I can't get Alexa to understand me and I would love to be able to just navigate to what I want. For instance - Alexa did not want to go to hulu. It kept giving me wikipedia and not the app. It would have been great to have a button to press.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2020"

If it came with a user manuaor something more than a very small fold-out piece of paper, I could probably figure out how to utilize the product. As it is I have to depend on my daughter and granddaughter for help in setting it up and operating.

I bought this along with the Echo Show 5, which is totally awesome in my bedroom. The Echo Show 8 can do so much, I haven't even tapped into its full potential!!! I love how I can view my Ring doorbell and cameras on it, and I love being able to ask Alexa to find me recipes, tell me the news, tell me the weather, and to play me some music!! I love being able to display a random rotation of my photos too, like a digital picture frame. I cannot believe how cool this is!

I purchased three of them to communicate with my family and I am only able to connect with two of them instead of connecting with six as it should. Video quality is very disappointing.  The device should notify you when you get inbound calls.

It has thousands of good reviews but I assume those are bots.Apart from this, this device is one of the best purchases I've made on Amazon.

Like we already drank the Alexa Kool Aid, stop trying to sell us. But anyway besides that it’s great. I’m apple products through and through. Then I got an echo dot with my fire stick purchase and we loved it. I have a ring doorbell, so I wanted it to work with that, and auto show me the doorbell instead of having to look at our phones. And it works great, kind of. You still have to say “Alexa show me the front door”. Kind of frustrating that it’s already communicating with the doorbell. It rings and tells you someone’s at the door. Why can’t it auto show the camera feed when someone rings? Hopefully a future update. But all other aspects of it are great. Screen looks great. It sounds great.

1066,jeff carter,Worth Buying Just To Try It,"  Ok seriously, this thing is amazing. First of all Alexa is by far the superior digital assistant. I’ve tried bixby, cortana, Siri and now Alexa. I even doubled back to all of them to be sure it wasn’t just recency bias. No way, Alexa is the best. Not perfect, if they care amazon can ask me what I would want to see improved. So, the speaker is amazing. I mean from all four sides. Even the front is amazing without over blasting Loud to back behind it  it exists in large open main living area and kitchen and dining. So the speaker is super good. I’ve played it at max loud and it’s just unnecessary unless your compensating for a bad recording. The super quiet is pretty good too. This is my first Alexa device, but on vacation we stayed at a place that had the tall echos on each floor. And we had loads of fun. The kids kept trying to stump Alexa. So the tech got a good workout. And I got a sense of limits.  The screen is a whole new ballgame though. Often, visualizing a thing helps me remember doing or saying it. Also gives me confirmation that it is done. I can watch things. The integration is so cool.  The other smart items it syncs with doesn’t just let you send commands but almost everything I tried I can interact from the Show’s screen. Dim or brighten lights on other floors is one I enjoy. But there are an astounding number of apps and devices that it interacts with and by voice at that.  So I love this thing and I love very few things. The only drawback is that it has no life when you unplug it. So it’s an inconvenience to move. But it’s the only drawback and I’m willing to accept that it is what it is until batteries are on the next level. Thanks",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2020"
1067,dashadow,Content is sometimes inappropriate...,"  Amazon will sometimes suggest movies, shows, and things that we don't care about. We just want to see our pictures scrolling and be able to play some music. I keep looking through the settings and I've even searched online... There is apparently no way to stop these movie suggestions from showing up. We click on the suggestion and say that we don't want it... And then a few days later another suggestion pops up. I'd like to have it made to where we can keep it strictly our pictures. That is the only reason I gave four stars.

1068,The Louligan,Best echo show ever!,"  I would say this is the best echo. It’s screen is just right. Not too small (echo show 5) and not too big (echo show). As I put it in my office desk it is perfect size.The sound is good, not great for its size. It has good bass when I set the bass to max in the equalizer sound setting.Having echo with screen is really helpful especially for me that I like listening to music, where I can see the lyrics when playing song on Amazon Music. I like to play music on different device not on my MacBook because I use my MacBook for coding, so playing music on dedicated device help me save some memory.The only issue I have is with youtube. It’s not easy to watch youtube as there is no youtube integration with the echo show. Opening youtube from the echo show browser is not straight forward. I wish amazon can work with google to have youtube integrated in the near future.I will recommend this device for those who wants to have a dedicated assistant while your doing your work on the office.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2019"

I've tried to use AllRecipes personal recipes and it's a joke and never works.  I almost sent this product back because of it but decided to keep it anyways.  Hopefully they can fix this because it's a HUGE turnoff!Other features work great, she recognizes our voice from across the room, and the play music, drop in and add things to a list feature are awesome.

1071,I Want That,Alexa Audio Quality,"  Overall, very satisfied with the Show and all its features with one exception, the audio. Alexa’s communication is somewhat unclear (too much base, muddy) although not nearly as bad as the echo dot 3 yet not as clear as the echo dot 2. There is a way to adjust sound for music play but apparently this does not apply to Alexa so understanding her requires concentration and repetition. It seems to me that this can easily be corrected by having the equalizer settings apply to her as well (this should also be done for the dot 3 which I no longer use due to the very poor muddled Alexa audio).",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2020"

I have my Echo Show on my nightstand next to my bed and a very loud portable air conditioner. Alexa can even hear me over the noise of the AC. I love all of the features. Alexa guards my home while I am away, offers helpful tips and hints, and acts as my alarm clock every morning. I love that the routines can be set up to activate different features with only a single command... and its TOUCHLESS! Wooo! Each morning, after I dismiss my alarm clock alarm by voice, Alex plays the date, time, weather, and my flash briefing, which you can customize to be anything you want.

I was hoping this could be sort of a media sidekick while i'm working from home and my other main screens are occupied. But I guess I like uncommon shows and things, so it is difficult to pick something i want to watch if i don't have the exact name of it. Example: I want to watch anime, and it's really terrible at serving me up anything i'd like unless it's in my cache of videos i've purchased. Can't even really select things great through the UI since it doesn't seem programmed for that experience. I'd rather just use my Kindle Fire and attach a speaker to the back of it honestly....and I do think that is what I will do instead....it is a good kitchen device though especially if you just consume mainstream media.i'm no audiophile...but although there does seem to be a good amount of bass in it, it does seem to wash out other sounds from your show.

We use the shopping list constantly and it’s so fantastic to ask it about a recipe and it will show you.

Unfortunately, in comparison to the 1st Gen Echo Show i realized that the far-field microphones are sometimes not picking up commands or are totally misunderstood. My first gen Echo Show had never any problems, even from the other side of the room to understand and get everything.Even when the wake up word is understood, then Alexa just stays idle and just doesn't to anything:""Alexa, add Bananas to my shopping list"" was misunderstood. Adding other items sometimes, Alexa stopped after the wake-up word.I have realized that the Echo Show 8 is very sensitive to background noises, i.e. while the first gen Echo Show did understand everything with a lots of background noises (somebody speaking on the phone or my kids playing), this version of the Echo Show 8 leads to ""Alexa confusions"", so it can't realize if this is a command or a background noise.Sound quality. I can't understand the reviews about the sound quality from some people here. It is correct that the Echo Show 1st gen did not create a room-filling sound quality. However, in comparison, my old Echo Show sounded in general a lot better and louder (probably due to the Dolby).I will try to retrain the voice models for my two users although when i connect my old Echo Show (1st Gen) back i don't have any problems with recognition of voice commands.

Clunky as heck to get it to act as a slide show (one would think this is as easy as falling out of bed).  Once you get a picture you like, too bad because Alexa is hell-bent on constantly showing you Covid-19 tips.  There is no way to make it stop.  Walk by it and say ""Alexa, show my home screen"" and you will be happy for a few minutes.  Then it's back to the old  rant about Covid.  WHY?  Might as well just get one of the little hockey pucks since there is nothing to see on the ""show.""",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2020"

Alexa could hear me and respond, but the music was muted. The lyrics appeared as songs played, but you couldn't hear anything.  Now, both stop playing part way through a set. I'll request, for example, play techno. It will play a couple songs then stop.  Previously it played for hours.

Two, we use it for getting recipes and watching the videos on how to put them together, lol. And lastly, there is the linking to our doorbell and cameras.

Pretty neat to just have all your wedding pics playing through when you first walk into the kitchen on your anniversary.I would like to see the list of supported wireless cameras and streaming content expanded.  I have already had to return some well-reviewed Heimvision cameras due to no Alexa support.  Would be nice to have mounting options.  I purchased a nice 3rd party base to lift if off the kitchen counter.  But the ability to flip screen orientation and mount it under a kitchen cabinet would be nice.  I see plenty of potential in this device.  I was able to video call from my mobile using the Alexa app on my phone.I picked up during Prime Day for under $60.  With 12 month subscription to Food Network Kitchen which was underwhelming.  You would think a paid video subscription service to the food network would provide access to the endless recipes they have made on their channel, and or create custom step by step videos so you could follow along.

The devices themselves have nice displays, cameras, and blue-tooth which I use to sync with my MP3 player or my Android phone.  The 1 star rating is for functionality.My dad was able to get his Echo Show 8 up and running without too much issue - except he had no way to add contacts.  The device does not have a means for adding contacts directly.  So I told my dad to try adding contacts by logging onto Alexa.amaxon.com - No option to add contacts.  Dad has a Windows 10 laptop so I instructed him to download the Alexa app from the Windows Store.  Again - no option to add contacts.Which brings me to our issues - these devices is that the setup requires the use of the Alexa app on a Smart Phone as the app wants access to read the contacts listed on the phone and upload them.I personally have 100+ contacts - most of them business contacts, that I did not want uploaded.  So I revoked access to the contacts on my phone and was able to log onto alexa.amazon.com and delete the contacts I did not want on my Echo Show 8.My parents are in their 70's and they only have some old flip phones.  Neither one of them have the desire to switch to a smart phone.  It's taken me about 3 months doing research on the weekends to finally figure out how that initially, contacts can only be added using a Smart Phone.I purchased a $20 LG Android phone I found on Amazon and got it setup using a WiFi connection only.  then downloaded the Alexa app and made sure that I was the only contact listed on the phone.  Over Thanksgiving, I had my dad log into the Alexa app and I verified that the contacts on the phone were synced with their Echo Show 8.Then we tried a call - Alexa kept saying the she couldn't make calls.  And even though I have an Echo Show 8, my parents Echo Show did not acknowledge that I had one and would not do video calls.Our solution was to do a factory reset of my parents Echo Show 8 and I added it to my Amazon account.  Now we can do video calls but that's not how this was supposed to work.  Obviously, its way past the return period so I feel stuck with these unless I can find a buyer for them.I admit that I should have done a lot more research besides quickly looking at reviews.  I checked the support forum for the Echo devices and I'm not the only one having issues with these devices.It seems to me that a simple software update to the device, alexa.amazon.com and/or the Windows 10 Alexa app could solve the issue with the initial setup of contacts.If you're looking for a device to do video calls with an older person who doesn't use or like technology then keep looking - the Echo Show is NOT the device for them.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2020"

I bought this for $52.22 during Black Friday / Cyber Monday which is the best time to buy any proprietary Amazon products. I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this item as its main purpose seems to be to steer me towards other Amazon products. I wish the Echo Show had the Kindle Text-To-Speach like the Fire Tablet does. It's so ironic that the Echo Show's screen stays on 24/7 because that's the one thing I wanted the Fire Tablet to do so that I could use the Kindle Text-To-Speach option while I am driving.

1150,Amazon Customer,Good intent but functionality not there - huge sound issues,  I really wanted to like these things.  We bought 5 for the office to communicate and also integrate with ring.  When you make a call between devices the sound does not work on one or both devices.  Unplugging and plugging in does seem to work to reset the device but it just ends up happening again.  It does not end up being a reliable communication device.  Happened once with the ring doorbell as well.  Video appears but someone can't hear the other person and sometimes both ways.  Amazon tech support (remember this is made by Amazon) their only advice was a factory default reset.  I was hoping tech support would say - this is a known issue and here update the software and it will be fixed.  It is clearly a software issue that will hopefully get fixed at some point but enough people will need to complain before that happens.  After spending 90 minutes with tech support and no remedy (and no offer of any kind of compensation on these brand new devices) I suspect most will just grin and bear it and unplug their device and just deal with this poor functionality.  The tech guy acted like I was nuts when I called and a simple internet search shows people all over the place are having this issue.  Amazon always seems flashy and has some cool tech but I feel like it is consistently a disappointment.  Alright rant over - don't buy if you want to try to use this for calls or integrate with ring - it is not consistent.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2020"

It goes to sleep for some reason and I have to tap the screen to start it up again. This is not acceptable and I may return the item if not resolved.

Here's a few tips to get it to work properly. 1.) Make sure you have a strong wifi connection with proper bandwidth. 2.) Set your video quality resolution on the XT2's app to ""Saver"". There is a small noticeable difference in resolution/definition but if you want to show live video, this feature must be set to Saver mode for it to work. Until Blink or Echo Show updates it to accept high res. This is the only work around. The speaker is phenomenal, full amd rich that's comparable to the Echo itself.

1154,Sarah,Is Echo Show 8 Worth It?,"  For starters I wanted the bundle that included Blink Mini. Got the Echo Show 8 no Blink Mini. I may have put the wrong order in.Got this to tie into my Blink XT2 Cameras outside. Hookup to cameras was tricky at first but after I Disabled Blink SmartHome from the Amazon Alexa App and relinked it, all was good. The buffering is slower then the iPhone. When Alexa announces motion to camera you can't hook in live (techs need to work on this). I did figure out how to kind of by pass this using Routines in the Alexa App so camera goes on when motion is announced. I would prefer to choose the camera to go on. I do like that I was able to setup in Routines a security so that when there's motion from the camera in the middle of the night my living room light goes on (makes one think someone's home or up).Hookup into the other Smart Devices no problem. The Voice Recognition picks up even from the far side of the room.I will be using it to play my music quite often. The sound quality is really good. I like that you can set the Equalizer and add external speakers. Added bonus...with Amazon Music you can see the lyrics to the songs if you want.The unit itself is strong and sturdy. Does not slide/move when using Touchscreen.If you're already familiar with Echo itself there should be no problem (learn to use settings).So is Echo Show 8 worth it? I would have to say...Yes! I did get it on sale which makes it a very good deal. Although like I said before, I wanted the bundle that included the Blink Mini (which would make a great deal).

If you use the Show 8 regularly, you will need to clean it two or three times a day.  If you happen to use a lotion, count on even more frequent cleaning.  The auto dim feature is a love-hate relationship.  It's good to dim the screen at midnight, in the dark but when it happens at 3:00 PM in a dim room, it is very annoying.  On the other hand, the speakers are excellent for this type of devise.  The screen resolution is adequate for viewing almost anything.  It's not HDR, 4K but it is a very watchable view.

1159,Matty O,Group call impossible for phone users,"  My sister and I got this for our parents so we could do video calls with them since we live in the different states. We've done a few one on one calls through the app and things were fine, but it hasn't lined up that we had time to do a group call with all of us together until this month.Amazon only allows group video calls between Amazon devices and it's not compatible with just the Alexa app. That means both my sister and I have to shell out an additional $60 minimum (current price of a show 5) to do a group video call with my parents, and there is NO mention of this flaw on the Echo Show 8 store page despite it proudly stating ""Connect with video calling and messaging - Call friends and family who have the Alexa app or an Echo device with a screen"" and that was the whole point of this purchase. On top of that, starting a group call is weird and convoluted since you have to enable enhanced features in the communication menu, start a group chat, and then you're required to ask Alexa to start a group call instead of being able to call with a tap of button like you can with other calls. It looks like group calling isn't even an option unless you look up how to do it. That's coming straight from a call I had with Amazon IT as well.It's fine other than that, but I wouldn't have purchased this if I had known that my sister and I would've had to convert to the ""Amazon Ecosystem"" in order for it to work.

1174,lindsey caston,It has a decent size screen.,"  What I like about the Echo Show 8. What I most like is that it has a display. I already had a echo 1st generation and a echo Plus. I put off buying the echo dot due to it’s tiny size screen, so I decided to purchase the Echo Show 8 due it’s screen size and sales price which included a free echo dot. Naturally the Echo Show 8 does everything the other echos does, but it has the advantage of having a screen to see some features you couldn’t see on the other’s such as news videos when listening to your Flash briefings. You also have access t Tubi  (no account required) which is good if you done mine watching long programs on a 8” screen and others channels such as Hulu, NBC, Prime video, and kitchen all of which requires account linking.I also like that you can download pictures from your phone or Amazon cloud account and add them as background photos show.It’s also nice to have the ability to see the other person you call when both have echo devices with videos capabilities, leaving my phone free for other use.Resuming; what I most like of the echo show 8 is that it has a decent size screen which is the only thing that distinguish it from the others echo devices which does not have a screen. Voice recognition is no better then the others echo devices and I find the the sound quality is not better then the sound I got from my Echo plus even if it does have stereo 2.5” speakers on either side.What I most find disturbing of the Echo Show 8 is the Constance, annoying messages which appears at the bottom on the screen and which their isn’t any way to eliminate.

1182,Kindle Customer,Not as good as a dot,"  The voice recognition is not nearly as good as it is in my Echo Dots. Non-stop barrage of suggestions gets old quick. It gets things wrong a lot (eg: “what were last night’s powerball numbers” is always answered with numbers from months or years ago, whereas Dots get it right). Keeps telling me wifi is not connected, even as it is streaming music or performing other function that requires WiFi.Sound quality is good and screen works great.

When we make a video call, we can see the person we called, but they can't see us. We've made sure the camera is on and tried trouble shooting on our own, but the video still isn't working.

1184,John,Good if you’re only looking to get an hour out of it,"  Got the Echo Show 8 as a Christmas gift. Plugged it in and set it up around 1 pm. A little after 2 I saw it restarting out of the corner of my eye and assumed it was a software update or something. Except it kept rebooting, never getting past the amazon logo. After searching online and trying everything I could find, then chatting with Amazon for over 45 minutes, apparently I have a defective unit and can’t get it replaced for 2 weeks. This was a gift I wasn’t originally thrilled with as I didn’t see enough value in it compared to my echo dot, and now I’m down right annoyed and wish I wasn’t given it (not being ungrateful, just becoming more of a hassle than it’s worth)",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2019"

There are times I spend a bit too much time re-establishing connectivity and there are times when it does not seem to either recognize my voice or understand commands that worked previously. This is all new tech and an amazing addition to our lives but there's a price to pay in what they demand to fully work and continue to function.

If I could get netflix, funimation, and a few other apps i may use it a bit more. Its less intrusive if i decide to turn something opposed to the tv if im the only one up. It syncs to my airpods so thats a plus. For what I use and what i use it for I love it; I did disable alot of the core features that I just dont see myself using for a nightstand clock. I will be purchasing another for the kitchen.It would be nice if it didnt time out when viewing cameras as a baby monitor.

Hands down, the sound quality is greatly improved! Nice improvements to the deeper bass sounds, although I could argue to almost to the point that the highs drop out.Mostly, I was disappointed that my app didn't allow me to add this to our home and that the device doesn't allow some of the new features (like stereo pairing) with older devices. This seems lazy to me.I didn't like that I had to enter the passwords of our account into the device multiple times to set it up.Overall, if I don't have to change configurations too many times, I think I'll like this.

And she is all about getting deals & clearance sales..lol We were just watching T.V together one evening and they were  Advertising About Amazon day's. And she told me we she at leaat take a look. Well she knows I really miss my momma every since she moved away but more so now that she's older & lives 9 hours away. And I'm unable to handle that long of a drive & even half way would be pushing it. Not to mention my sister's want to see her as well & they wouldn't be able to either. I love my momma so much & miss being able to see her when she came to see us all. So we both were on our cell's & I came across the Echo Show 8 & half off a Smart plug-in. And it was one of the prime day sales. And I told her hey look at this and what it can do! Do you think my mom would use this? She said aak her..lol So I had to call her & told her. I wanted to buy one for her & me but she didn't want me to ir let me pay for hers. My better half seen Echo Dot 3 w/ half off on a smart plug-in. Whixh she LOVES music and cooking and has been wanting to get one. Well after looking a little while longer we came across a doorbell camera wich she found made by someone else and I have respect for the makers of all the echoes so I will not say who it is but it isAlexa compatible. With me being in a wheelchair I can't see who is outside if someone comes by. Well due to the prime day's & have Amazon Prime membership wich does get you even more off on some thing on sale (not often but it happens). And it was all for under $200. And if we had got it without prime day's it would have been $399 & im not sure if that's before or after tax but either way amazing deal! And my mom said she was getting the Echo Show 8 also.  Well at first it said it was going to be something like 3-5 weeks. Well it was around a week. Still waiting on the Echo Dot 3 & both smart plug-in. But my momma surprised me by making a video call to me one day! And I was taking a nap so really caught me off guard. It was AMAZING  the sound was almost perfect the video waa the same & I'd had few people that said it will drop your call well we talked for 3 hour's!! I hadn't seen her in a long time & it was like she waa sitting beside me &my wife was sitting with us as well. It waa so great to be able to talk & actually see each other & when you're talking about something you can just show them! THIS IS AN AMAZING PRODUCT!  I would pay full price if i hadn't seen it on sale. And now my little sisters can see her as well. But more importantly to me she xan see her 6 grandchildren!! I do not have any kids but my niece's &  nephews can see her. 3 of them are 4 years ago or younger. I just want to say thank you to the makers of such an amazing idea! I know that you can use your cell but its hard to see and then you have to move it everywhere so they can see eaxh other. So the show is well worth the money. Amd not to mention it has so many features & Alexa can do more than you can imagine.

We wanted to replace our Motorola baby monitor and this function isn’t as effective as a monitor.  First, you can’t use the talk function from the Eco while looking through the camera unless you are on the Blink app.  Night vision of the mini blink isn’t as sharp as a conventional baby monitor. If the baby makes a sound it doesn’t come through right away.  If you want to keep the camera on, the picture keeps buffering.  I think it is an interesting concept but disappointing.  They need to work on a better integration to really function as a baby monitor.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2020"

You have install the Alexa app on your phone and even then it is not very intuitive or easy to find and install apps. When I finally found Sirius radio the app it wouldn't install. There are many pre installed apps but you cannot see a list of them on the device. Instead the Echo verbally name the app and ask you if you want to try. It would take forever to get the list from the device. I do not have any smart devices linked to the Echo so cannot speak to the usefulness of that feature.

The Alexa app did not have a set up option for echo show but we made it work, it was also difficult to set up two different phones to the account but we just signed two phones on the same account. Also don’t like that the screen is angled up so the camera often faces the ceiling. Overall a good purchase.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2020"
1264,Betsy,Basically a limited tablet sitting on top of a speaker.,"  I like the quality of the sound and video display.  What I do not like is the limitations of the device, even with I would consider basic Amazon service functionality.  If I start a video and then pause it to return later I have to navigate back to the original movie listing in Prime Video to continue watching it.  I have not found a way to quickly return to a video I am watching without having to scroll through all the available movie listings until I reach the menu location of the movie.  I have activated the ""free year"" Food Network subscription but the service does not make it easy to find a specific type of recipe, such as ""dinner salad"".  Asking for a display of ""dinner salads"" resulted in a few actual salads and then several listings for wing recipes.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2020"

Does all the usual alexa stuff and the ability to see the images/videos adds enormously to the alexa utility.I'm not bothered by the Alexa recommendations that appear in the screw when the device is not in use, who sees them unless you constantly stare at the screen.Works great in kitchen area with a place to see recipes and other things while working there.Would certainly buy again.The 8 inch is very nice, but also have a 5 inch that is quite good if price is an issue",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2020"
1266,Jerry,Glitchy and poor customer service,"  The device repeatedly had issues turning on in the middle of the night and at other random times. The screen would also freeze. Alexa would turn on without the command to do so, then try to play a video/news pausing every 1 second as if she were having a seizure. There was one night where she started shouting ""Pink! Pink! Pink! Pink!"" On max volume followed by blasting ""Get the party started"" by Pink. My husband called Amazon, and the customer service rep wanted us to do a better job to prove that there was something wrong with the device. First, they had us plug the device into another outlet for a week. Amazon then needed to monitor the device 2 separate times before agreeing that there was an issue and that an exchange was worthy. When then finally attempting to exchange the item, all of the documentation was supposedly made under my husband's name, but all of the processing remained under my amazon account. After we paid shipping to have the device and its accessory parts sent back to Amazon as we were instructed, the device was apparently refurbished rather than exchanged as promised. The refurbished product was sent back to us, and once again, we were charged for the shipping cost. Unfortunately, when opening the refurbished product, we found that the power cord had not been sent back to us with our device. We called amazon immediately about the issue, who informed us that if we want a power cord, we would have to purchase a new one. We decided to return the entire device for a full refund. We will not be purchasing another echo through Amazon.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2021"
1267,C. Carlson,Great little gadget!,  We really like our Echo so far! We use it for controlling lights and outlets. Also for making grocery lists which is very helpful. Just tell her to add something to our grocery list and go into the Alexa app on the phone at the grocery store and it's all there for us. Very convenient and useful.  We also can see who is at the door with our video doorbell.  Also can see what's going on with our other cameras. The video quality is good. Sound quality is good for a little thing.

1269,Amazon Customer,Poor Sound detection,"  My family has 5 of these, two spots,  an echo show 8 and 5 as well as the Echo.  The echo and the spots are great and solid devices. The Echo Shows on the other hand are less helpful.The Show 5 is cool, it allows you to customize the home screen and clocks. It fits well on the nightstand, and does what we need done well.The Show 8 was a gift, and intended to be used as the main Echo for the home. We love the display, size, sound, and design, but both our Shows have a really hard time hearing ""Alexa"" even in a quiet room or moderately noisy one. We never had to repeat the wake word as often with the Echo and Spots like we do with the Show 5 and more particularly with the show 8. Our TVs sound bar has alexa and is able to hear and respond faster than the Show 8, but we later disabled the sound bar because its too sensitive to the wake word. Ive noticed the Show 8 and 5 only have two microphones, and man not having 4 or more it really makes these devices much less user friendly.  It would seem Amazon has made some changes to the wake word because with the last update the issues has become more prevalent.Overall, we love the Echos, its allowed us to truly make our home a smart home and integrated  well with the plugs, and lights we own.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2020"

1281,Ange,Completely satisfied but there is always room to improve...,"  In my opinion the Echo should never be 5 stars since the whole concept is to constantly learn and improve upon Alexa’s abilities. The hardware (Echo Show 8) is great, a little heavy & sometimes ‘glitchy’ (nothing unplugging and plugging back in won’t fix). I think the Show should come with a stand as a standard vs an additional cost/expense (sitting directly on the counter makes it more prone to spilled liquid etc).  Alexa always gets smarter and there are more skills it seems daily. I do feel a little confused on how to expand the system by adding an Echo Dot, Smart Home functions and the integration of all these items.  For example building groups/rooms etc was confusing and how to play music everywhere... the same station or different stations and can the Echo Show control all of that? I find myself physically turning my Echo Dot off in the other room because I don’t fully understand how to get my Show to make those adjustments.  I know it is possible but a high level blueprint or matrix would be helpful. Otherwise I love Alexa and I am excited to continue watching how this technology grows and how it is changing the way go about our lives.

1284,Natty,Lifesaver for elderly family members during COVID; Drop-in feature great for tech challenged,"  My grandparents moved into an assisted living home at the beginning of COVID. Their phone wasn't set up yet, so we wanted a way to contact them in case of emergency. The Amazon Echo and the drop-in feature was an absolute lifesaver. They had a lot of trouble understanding how to answer a call, so we enabled the drop-in feature, which automatically connects you after a fade-in. In several emergency situations, we were able to connect with them before the assisted living home could connect with us. And the fact that you fix most problems with the device through the Amazon Alexa map meant that I could solve most problems with the device remotely when we couldn't get in to the assisted living home to see them.There are a few things that could use improvements- the app is slow and the UI is a little complicated, and the short cord on the echo means that it has limited reach and restarts every time you unplug it- but we were able to see them and check in during the months that we couldn't visit in person, and in both of my grandparents' final days, their family members were able to see them and say their goodbyes.

1290,corkyjon,Nice desk companion,"  I use this Alexa Echo on my home-office desk, and it is a handy assistant.  I can just ask Alexa little things that I might ordinarily look up.  It saves me the time and distraction of opening a new window on my computer.  Alexa plays WQXR for me during the day and always posts something like an album cover or some kind of illustration that informs me of each musical selection that is being played.  I can ask Alexa to calculate numbers or define words or whatever.  I can ask Alexa to remind me of deadlines or important to-dos or set a timer for certain things.  The video component will allow me to see news clips or explanatory YouTube vidoes through Firefox.  I can ask for suggestions for Dinner tonight and she will offer a few recipes, add the ingredients to my shopping list, and then save the recipe where I can pull it up later for reference while cooking.  (Of course, this requires taking the Alexa Echo to my kitchen.)  Oh, and I love the classic art selection that scrolls across the screen.  It is significant to point out that the Alexa screen is not dark when not in use - it scrolls a selection of pictures in accordance with the subject matter you choose, along with news headlines and little suggestions of trivial things you can do with Alexa.  I am sure there are other neat tricks that I have not discovered yet, but it is fun to try things as I think of them to see what Alexa can do, and it is very nice to have the video option.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2020"

Prior to Christmas I have had a number of the Alexa throughout the house and had no issues. At Christmas I purchased 2 Alexa Show 8 and 1 Alexa Show 5; I personally use the Show 8's.  I tried and tried hoping a software update was underway but it is driving me crazy.  The device does not hear correctly and often not at all.  I had to stop using the Show 8 as my alarm because 1. It was not going off 2. When I play sleep music all night, the device no longer responds to commands by morning.  The blue light comes on indicating I was heard, but nothing happens.  I give the command to stop the music and nothing happens.  The Only way to resolve is unplug and plug back in....every morning.  So, I went back to using my phone for my alarm.  I hear the wife each morning having to keep yelling at her Show 8 because of the same issue but she is trying to get the alarm to turn off.  Again, the voice command bar indicates she is heard but nothing is happening.  There are times when I drop in and the other person cannot hear me at all, this happens WAY too often.  There have been times I was traveling and dropped into check on the kids.  They could not hear me so just walked away.  Very disappointed.

1304,Nickels,ALEXA IS A VALUABLE TOOL FOR THE PROFESSIONAL LEARNER...THE ELDERLY,"  Although valuable to use,  for  those of an older age, like 77 and 80 as we are, it should be integrated one step at a time.  That is what we like to do.  Take a suggestion listed on our screen by Alexa and try that out.  For example, today I tried the vocabulary skill builder.  It is very interesting to me to work on word meanings having had Latin in high school.  It is also a challenge and gathering points so I can move up the chain is a great motivator.  Other things we have tried are communicating by calling daughter.  Nice to see her as well as talk to her.  Love setting a reminder alarm and have also asked for a recipe from Alexa.  I am sure that as we keep learning by trying out different features, it will only get better and better.  A wonderful tool to keep us in the know with RING audible, too.  A wonderful Christmas gift for us!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2021"

Alexa's ability to recognize my voice and interact has been improving my use of more Alexa features. I listen to a lot of Audible books and watch shows and movies the most.

1311,BatGirl,Love this device and all it can do!,"  I bought an Echo Show 5 earlier and like this larger sibling much better, mostly because of its bigger screen--which makes things easier to read and view from farther away--and better sound. I expect that I'll eventually buy a couple more to replace earlier, more limited Echo devices I own that are spread around my home. One knock I had on the Echo Show 5 was that even at its highest brightness setting, the images, etc., seem too dark to me.

I was impressed that I could stop the cycling of comments and pictures.  I have it where my handicapped wife can see it and I can use drop in to check on her.  She was bothered by the changing screen.  The fact that I could turn that off made it great for our purposes.  The only thing I would prefer is if I could turn off the notification sound when I do a drop in to chech on her when she is sleeping.

I love the ease is use and plethora of features. Comments I read before I bought shared a dislike for the small print on the bottom of the screen sharing suggestions for ways to use and what Alexa does. I LOVE this feature- Maybe it's because I am new to Alexa but it helps me navigate all the usage options. The sound quality is great and the voice recognition is super. Extremely easy to use. My 12 year old set this up, gave me simple instructions, and I was off. Probably the best purchase of year for our family. I absolutely love it.

1326,Jo,Should be better,"  I really thought this would be a game changer for our house. I bought two of these during the Cyber Monday sale. After a couple of months, I can say that these devices don't live up to their potential.It's all about what you what you are looking for in a product. When I see an 8"" HD screen on an Echo, I assume I will get good use out of that screen. However, watching videos is not something the Echo Show 8 does well. You can only watch videos with pre-installed apps. So basically, Prime Video and Hulu (for now). If you go to websites using a browser, you still can't access any videos. It looks like Amazon purposely limited these devices with apps and abilities.The screen does add some nice features. You can add your own background photos. You can view visuals of weather and time/timers. I do enjoy being able to keep a recipe on the screen while cooking. Unfortunately, the screen also seems to serve as an advertisement display for Amazon. You can't get away from the ""Try Alexa..."" permanently on the screen. There are also a ton of ads for recipes, trending stories, etc.. Luckily you can turn some of those off. It mostly seems like a waste of a screen with today's technology and apps.The speaker is definitely a plus. They sound better than I anticipated. But there are plenty of good speakers for this price or less, including Amazon devices. Voice command technology has only come so far. There are still a lot of commands that return a ""I can't help you with that..."" despite the simplicity of the request.The bottom line (from my experience), don't waste the money on something that could be a lot better for the price. You'll notice the Echo Show 8's limitations more than its abilities. If you want voice command and a speaker, get a dot or Echo. If you're looking for video integrated with voice command, it's not quite there yet. If I could do it over, I probably would've rather customized a tablet that can do everything.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2020"

When playing music, the sound is pretty decent, but I've hooked up stand-alone speakers which makes it better. Also have one in the bedroom we use for alarms, announcing the temperature and weather forecast for the day and headline news to start the morning. When one of us is in the bedroom and the other in the office on the other side of the house, we use Alexa to talk.  If you are worried about privacy, you can block the camera and mute the microphone.

Sure enough, just that easily I was watching Prime Video Jack Ryan. I had no idea I could do that!The speakers are very good, much better than I expected!  Surprisingly good bass.

Another very useful feature for me is Alexa's ability to build shopping and to-do lists, since I cannot write things down due to a handicap.

You can change the background and what data scrolls through, but the size of the time, the temp and showing today's date at all are not options.  You also constantly get Alexa suggestions.  Many tips on customization seem to be for other devices as there is no ""Home and Clock"" setting on the Show 8.  The only clock setting is 24 HR.  My mistake for thinking the 8 and the 5 had similar features, but the Show 8 options seem very lacking for any device with a screen.  But then the misleading tips on using the Show 8 didn't help that misunderstanding.The frustrating thing is that the Show 8 is almost a very good product.

Sound is definitely not good compared with even the very first Alexa. That might just be because of the direction the speakers face but it’s pretty noticeable. We had hoped to do video calls with the grandparents but so far after a month we still haven’t done even one.

Then the clock only takes a maybe a 1/6 of the screen so its actually smaller than the 5.

My only issue is that, we use YouTube, disney + and other streaming services that the Echo Show is not compatible or wont integrate. It does have Hulu, but now a days there are so many different streaming services that if this device was compatible, it would be a solid 5 star. Also as far as more features, it would be nice to have a maps feature or a better search engine integration. Hence that is  where the google devices are a bit better when it comes to searching directions or certain restaurants near you.

1390,Diane Aldridge,"My family loves these, just a couple short comings","  So I actually love the echo show eight, and just have a couple complaints-1. One feature we appreciated with our echo dots was the way we were able to connect them so we could play music throughout the whole house easily and some thing I was quite unpleasantly surprised to find was the fact that it was telling me I couldn’t connect my echo show to my echo dots- it was completely unexpected and caught me by total surprise so I thought that was a little weird considering it’s the same voice assistant made by the same company... not a dealbreaker by any means just annoying...And 2. The voice recognition could use a little work but there are of course always variables such as background noise, clarity of the users voice and so on so again not a dealbreaker but at times can be a little bit annoying.Other than that my whole family loves both the echo show and the echo dots, and we use them daily and have them scattered throughout the house I just thought I would point those two things out quick for a potential buyer to take in consideration-",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2020"

My mom is elderly and we were able to set the unit up so I can “drop in”.  We are still working on her using voice commands, but we are getting there.All in all, it has been a real blessing. Alexa sets timers, reminds of appointments, keeps my lists. She’s a good helper.  A few things I would add, day and date on screen always, ability to set monthly occurring events instead of just one time and perhaps color codes for the buttons to make it easier for old eyes to see.

Big disappointment to spend extra to get the “better” device only to find out you can’t do the one thing you really wanted.I’m sure they will update this eventually but for now, it’s a stinker.

I think Echo show is a better option for some because of the following...1.  Echo Show 8 has a bigger screen than Google Nest Hub.  Echos Show 5 is about $20 less the Google Nest Hub.2.  Contrary to beliefs, Echo Show 5 and 8 are capable of showing YouTube videos via the Firefox Browser.3.  Echo Show 5 and 8 have 2 accessible web browsers.  Google Nest Hub does not have an accessible web browser, which you can use to view websites.4.  If you have Amazon Prime, you can watch Amazon Prime videos.  You can't on Google Nest Hub. (Althouth you can watch youtube tv on the Google Hub, which you can also do on the Echo show 5 and 8.5.  You can also link your Hulu Service to Amazon Echo 5 and 8 and watch Hulu on it.  You can not watch Hulu on Google Nest Hub.  Although there are some workarounds on casting from device to device.  You are better off just getting a streaming service device on your television than have it cast and bog down your wifi.  I have both Google and Amazon infrstructures at my smart home.

I dont care about the S&P, I want to see my holdings displayed. Also why does it assume the scores I want to see are all just local teams, maybe I follow a team from somewhere else.Turn off the Alexa discovery tips on the bottom of the screen!!!How about a USB port in the back to charge a phone instead of a service micro usb port that is for service only as far as it appears.All that said the sound is ok for a bedroom clock, however still pales compared to the new 4th gen Echo.

Only drawback is it struggles to understand me sometimes, but I wonder if it's my Southern accent?",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2020"
1432,B. Pace,Bulky and glitchy,"  Have used this for few months now. Not sure if the item was returned or was new due to packaging. It wasn’t registered to anyone so I assume new. It is very glitchy - voice recognition makes mistakes routinely. We have to repeat many times. Once it takes you to what it thinks you said - you have to exit and repeat what you really want. That’s very annoying too. We like to play games on the device but also annoying when it asks every time if you want to sign up for a subscription on basically every game. We have the google comparable version - voice recognition, games, search is much better. They should Save the response from before and not ask again. It is bulky. Shaped like an old cathode ray tube tv. I guess much of it is the speaker/mic. Nice features being able to use as an intercom with other Alexa devices, play music. Connecting devices is ok with the app. Again google was easier and better. Switched to Alexa as we kept getting echo dots thrown in with purchases. I guess they caught us. The ask Alexa notices on the main screen - don’t bother so much. If you switch to do not disturb - it stops the notifications but then you can’t fully use the device. Hopefully future updates make things run smoother.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2020"
1433,Amazon Customer,Great Device,"  I was really hesitant to purchase an Echo show, thinking what would i really use it for. Now, I'm very happy i did. I really love the video that accompanies everything I already did.  People are complaining about things in these reviews that are ridiculous. I mean really, where are your priorities? Seriously,  it and you aren't that important. My only issues are sound quality could use a boost and microphone responsiveness could be improved.

Video quality is fantastic.When I am not at home , I can use this to stay in touch and see what the kids are doing.There is a drop in feature which I love, love, love.

I don't do video calling, it will show me my front door on voice command (and answer by voice if I wish) with my ring doorbell which is nice but hardly justifies the cost, music  quality is good, I can watch Prime video but I can do that on my smart TV with a much bigger screen.  Still learning about this viewer and hoping to find some other uses that might make me glad I bought the thing.

1441,jread80,Great Product for those who work from home and/or are invested in smart home products,"  I don't write many reviews, but I almost didn't buy this because of the sort of dire warnings from some reviewers about the supposedly horrible ""Things to Try"" that are forced on buyers, like you're paying Amazon to have them furnish you with a never ending commercial.I bought one anyway. Two elements of important context as to why this is helpful for me is 1) I am one of the many people who have been turned into 100% work from home employees when i used to be 33% work from home, and very much miss the dynamic of interaction and getting out of the house.Disclaimer: although I am grumbling about this, I feel very lucky to have a job, and would feel badly if someone read this who has been laid off, affected by COVID, and wished they too could be ""bothered"" by all the meetings and the paycheck that comes with it.With that said, I have found the volume of online meetings I participate in stressful and unpleasant. I have managed teams in the past, and were I a manager at the moment I would limit my team to 4 meetings a day, max. Whenever I am doing my best work, ie focused work that requires a lot of thought and blocking other things out, I was finding I was missing meetings, which is very embarrassing, bad for your professional reputation, and just the sort of thing that sucks...it ruins your day to a degree.I love the flexibility of being able to integrate Microsoft personal, Office 365, Google, Apple, and/or on Premises Exchange Server-based calendars to my Alexa app, and have my echo show announce when I have meetings coming, and to display my calendar for the day visually without having to open anything on my laptop. I haven't had my Echo show 8 long, but I can say, the last missed meeting I had was the day prior to my Echo show arriving and taking up residence on my home office desk. I read yesterday that later this year, Zoom calls will be supported on the echo show and that's even better. The cost of personal Webex devices , Microsoft Teams soundbars etc makes it the sort of thing that's executive only in terms of the company footing the bill, and yet having a separate, dedicated device, which I have had in the past, makes a big differences. It is impossible to explain, you have to experience it to understand the difference, but it is somehow less stressful to join a video call on a dedicated device - I mean a LOT less stressful than using software on you pc, mac, or especially a mobile device.The second reason this was worth it to me, is that I have invested a lot of time and effort over the past 2-3 years in smart devices in my home. When building a home in 2015, I was the only one on my new street who did not invest in an alarm system. My builder thought i was crazy. But that was when alarm systems were thousands of dollars, and much less functional than what's available today. Now, I have a Nest Outdoor IQ cam on every side of my house. These are expensive devices, and yet the combined cost is a fraction of what a security system would have been. I use a lot of Phillips Hue bulbs, and it's noticeably reduced my energy bill, and also given Alexa Guard motion senors for the 3 areas where i bought them for hue reasons. I have a bunch of other smart home devices, but right there I have a great use case, and there's many more like it. Kind of like the dedicated video device, you cannot verbalize properly how much more effective voice assistants are made when you add a visual display on top on them. It makes them, in my view, about 10x more useful.At less than $100, I think this is a bargain, and an excellent device.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2020"
1442,Sweating,$25 plastic stand?,"  Overall, I like the Echo Show 8. I do have occasional issues where Alexa does not respond to a voice command, you may say something like “Alexa turn off the dining room light” and nothing happens, the light comes on as if it is listening to you but you get no response and this can happen several times in a row. Perhaps she is on a potty break. The other thing I have a real pet peeve about is these companies that sell you a product and then have necessary accessories as an additional purchase. You can almost never buy an entire product at one time! I am of course referring to the cheap little plastic stand the goes with the Show 8 that Amazon thinks is worth $25...give me a break. At most it is worth $5 and it should have come with product at no charge.....my two cents worth!",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2021"

She definitely is in need of a ethics vocal course. Also she will not call your friends if they have black names, she will not call K'Shawna, Kaci, La'nisha, Earnice or Jaquay unless you read the number out to her.Update: Tested Alexa on some of my other friends and found that she just in general don't respond well to urban, creole or deep southern accents.

And after 10 minutes of the alarm sounding, it just goes off and never comes back on super deep sleepers that it takes a little while longer to wake up with an alarm, you don’t want to use this if you have somewhere that you have to be like work.

I just got it for Christmas, and I am not currently using it to it's full capabilities (video call, smart home) and still playing around with it.  It does have some really cool features and can do way more than I expected. Sound quality is great for playing music. Setup was super easy.  But sometimes I feel that if asking a question I could get a better/faster answer if I googled it on my phone. I considered getting this for my older parents but decided it was too complicated for them and would cause a lot of headaches.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2020"

1472,A. Gabel,Good enough but sometimes hears TOO much.,"  I like the display, which you can change to just about whatever you like; the sound is good, certainly MUCH better than the regular non-Show Echo devices and better than the Echo Show 5.  I wanted it for the STEREO SOUND, but in reality, unless you stick your nose within a foot of it, you can barely detect any stereo separation.  On the aggravating side, sometimes it responds to something ""It"" hears coming from the TV, and starts talking as if you gave it a command, which is a major distraction to the point that i almost pulled the plug on it since it wouldn't ""shut up"".  But I got it as part of a Amazon Prime Day sale so, it's worth it, overall.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2020"
1473,Adan Medina,Excellent sound!,"  Maybe it's only because the gap between my Echo Spot and the new Echo Show 8 is so huge but I am blown away! The sound quality is excellent and the screen size is perfect: the only minor glitch is that the Show doesn't always seem to hear the wake word. BTW, this is a touch screen as well as an audio device. If I didn't already have an Echo device in almost every room AND at my office, I would have picked up another since the Prime Day price was a steal.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2020"
1474,Iam CAGK,Great addition to my technology library,"  I purchased two Echo 8's, one for me and one for my daughter who lives in another state.  I love that I can just ask Alexa to call her and there she is in the room with me talking about what's going on.  I can see and hear her - almost as good as having her physically here.  When not talking to my daughter, Alexa keeps me entertained with music on demand (sound quality is great), and I'm still learning about other ""skills"" and features.  For me, it was money well spent.  I love my new Echo 8's.  Only drawback - you don't get a manual that tells you things about the device.  Amazon has a manual, but they charge you extra for it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2020"
1475,Sal Farfan ,Curiously amazing!,"  I didn't give any stars to integration because of a lack of definition for the word in this case.  But I had to give 5 stars for voice recognition.  After setting up my new Echo Show 8, I was amazed at the moment I woke Alexa by whispering her name & she whispered back in response to my request.  Amazing.  I gave 5 stars to sound quality.  I own two Bose machines that I always regarded as awesome for sound quality but this little Echo 8 puts out a sound to my ears so equally amazing.  I don't have to search for a music station.  I don't have to tap on an app to get the news, or learn what the temperature is outside or even if it's sunny or going to rain.  I just have to ask.  Amazing.  I am impressed with all this little machine sitting on my desk can do while I'm working on my laptop.

1476,Working mom,Nice device,"  I love having my pictures rotate and display and it's got nice sound quality with music.  Good video quality.  My issue is that if you want to do a private video chat with blue tooth ear phones it does not allow this.  You can listen to music this way, but as soon as you try to do a video chat to another echo device it drops the ear phones.  This is very disappointing as we purchased two so I could video chat with my mother.  Now we just use face time on ipads.  And use the echo as a digital picture frame and playing music.

Set up was a breeze and it easily integrated with the Echo Show 5 on my network.  I recently discovered I cannot reset the timer sound. (The alarm sound has options, but the timer only has a volume option.  Not that big a deal, but the default Amazon timer sound does not say ""time's up"" to me.)

1478,Hugh Alter,Alexa vs Google,"  To be fair - I got this just so that I could monitor my Ring cameras. Otherwise, I use Google Assistant because all my smart devices interface with it. As far as access to my cameras - great. Quick connection, great picture. As far as comparing Alexa to Google - Google has better information in searches (well, it's Google. What do you expect?) Also is able to answer certain questions more fully. for example, I asked each if there was rain it the weather forecast. Google told me yes - it was forecast for two days from when I asked. Alexa said she didn't know how to answer the question. So while I can't give a full review of the Echo 8 - it's doing what I need it to do.

The picture feature is handy.  It would be even better if it could access photos on Shutterfly or Google Photos.  The biggest negatives are there does not seem to be any way to stop it from interspersing annoying recipe's with pictures in the middle the picture displays and sometimes it shows ads.  They are so annoying I will never use any recipes that I happen to note are being displayed by Amazon and will refuse to buy products from Amazon that it displays in such an annoying way.

1518,Matthew Bartels,Well worth the money!,"  I purchased the Echo Show 8 as a gift for my mom. Our son just gave one to his dad for his birthday. The reason being we all miss my mom. I love the fact that myself, my husband, children, grandchildren and great grandchildren can now talk to my mom face to face since they are unable to see her in person. That alone makes this purchase a million times worth it. For her it makes missing hugging them a little more bearable. My husband and I love it for all the echo show is able to do. We now listen to satellite radio when we’re busy around the house and when we’re sitting around watching TV, we just ask Alexa questions that may pop up about the persons on our favorite shows and things like that. We are still learning all the things it can do and we are very happy with our purchase.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2020"

The icon was there with no “ sign in” under the app. I contacted support and despite restarting and and restoring to factory settings it would not allow me to log in ( nor show a “sign in”) the rep deemed it broken and recommended it being exchanged. I did and the replacement I received was a REFURB! Not only was it only the display in the box ( that’s it.. no plug nothing but the screen) I was a little upset that I bought new and that was replaced with an incomplete REFURB. After contacting support again I was told this is their policy even if you buy NEW! So returned again! Re-Bought NEW and still the same problem! A friend and I actually figured out the update and then it worked GREAT! Just not sure why the first rep I spoke with did not suggest this! So 1 month later I am Happy with the Echo Show 8.

I bumped mine up just slightly and my show started sliding across the table. the screen will run your pictures or the ones it comes with. With that being said it's pretty much like any other echo device . I do like the size of the screen. I have ordered another one for the bedroom as I have the echo 4th gen with the clock in there.

As far as Netflix goes, the sign in process is a pain, but once you get passed it, you're all set. As far as music goes, the same services that are available on a Echo Dot, are available on the Echo Show 8. The one thing that is very nice experience is video calling. However, you can only video call to other Echo Show devices. As far as the web browser goes, you have the choice to choose between Amazon Silk Browser or Mozilla Firefox.

Then later in the day when I go to play music, there is no bass, and I have to restart it again. Pretty major flaw.Unfortunately I have no desire to reach out to Amazon support.

I liked it enough to purchase another for my study. I like to play music and find the sound quality is better than  the  original  Echo.

Alexa doesn't know everything and it's somewhat disappointing that she doesn't understand some things I'd consider obvious. One of the best features for our family is no more paper shopping list! Simply tell Alexa whenever I think of something, and the list is updated on the Echo and my phone; a simple tap as the item is purchased removes it from the list. The Alexa app is like an extension of Echo. It makes the lists available on both our phones. Be cautious of some of the apps, or skills, used by Alexa because they're not all free and you don't know in advance. I'll get a pop-up in the app and am still uncertain how to opt out.

1688,ab,This is an amazing device!,"  We have both the Echo dot and the Echo Show 5 as well as the Echo Show 8. Having all three devices allows for a great comparison. Each device has its place and each is an excellent value (what it will do for what you pay).Buying them when they are on sale is the way to go, given that they have frequent sales (worth the wait). But of the three, the Echo Show 8 really blows the others away. First, having the video screen brings significant advantages to the Echo Show 5 and 8 (the number represents the approximate diagonal size of the screen in inches). Being able to watch videos, see news as text and have the words for songs show up (they do for most Amazon Music songs) makes the Echo Shows well worth the investment. The sound on all three Echos is excellent, but the Show 5 has deeper bass and better volume than the dot and the Show 8 has about three times the volume of the Show 5, with excellent bass. And the larger screen on the Show 8 is not only larger than the Show 5, but much brighter.We have chosen to put the Show 8 in the kitchen and it is the main unit we use (it easily fills a large room with high quality sound). The Show 5 works well in a bedroom and the dot is perfect for a hallway, bathroom or smaller space. All three seem to pick up our voice from anywhere in the room very well, unless you also are listening to TV or other sound-producing devices - but that is as I would have expected.One unexpected advantage of the Show 5 and Show 8 (haven't tried it on the Dot yet) is the ability to make calls WITHOUT pairing with a cellphone. You can ask Alexa to call the number you speak - and it will make the call. Although I have not tried it yet, I assume this would also work with 911 - which would be great for older adults that might fall or otherwise not be able to reach a phone or emergency button. Having a voice entry system is a huge advantage.We plan to purchase the Show 5 and Show 8 for family gifts at birthdays or Christmas, we are so impressed with them. We have also found them ideal for older adults that live alone and would like to have ""something to interact with"".  My mother-in-law is 93 years old and nearly blind, and she LOVES the Echo dot. She is unable to see the TV screen anymore or operate a remote and for that reason the Echo Shows would not be a good option for her. But she uses the Echo Dot constantly to ask about weather, news and other voice-tasks, and loves being able to ask it to play music from her youth (the Amazon Music subscription has been an excellent investment for her as well).We watched many comparison videos (check them out on YouTube) between the various Echo models as well as comparisons with the Nest and other competing devices. I would recommend the Echo Show 8 as the best choice for most individuals or families. The extra cost of the Echo Show 10 is hard to justify unless you are using it to control a number of smart home devices. But, for the modest difference in cost over the dot or Show 5, the enhanced sound and viewing of the Show 8 is definitely the way to go!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2020"

It works smoothly as a video call device, speaker, alarm, etc, however, my 4 stars go to how complicated and convoluted personalization and customization is on this thing. the Alexa app allows you to set up routines and default news broadcasters etc but as for my more used tools like Spotify... you're better off selecting it as a device through the Spotify app or using it as a Bluetooth device otherwise. It's also quite hard to find settings since the echo show really doesn't do much without the app, but that app is super bugged.

I also  find sometimes that I can listen to podcasts when I have pages and pages of documents to scroll through, although when I have to pay attention to what I'm reading, I find the podcasts too distracting so I tend to switch back to spa music, but I always have something playing now and I'm finding I really enjoy it.

Then, because I am so deep into Google I decided to switch to their Google Nest products. BIG MISTAKE!!!!!! Amazon Alexa products and software are better in so many ways, I could not even list them. My two biggest gripes with the Google products are, first, it’s very difficult to connect to smart home products. For example, I had to purchase a Sengled hub so that Google would connect and even then it was a huge hassle to make it work.  Alexa does it without a hub. Second, the Google product repeats back to you everything you ask it to do. And you cannot turn it off. So freaking annoying.  So, the Google hardware is now in a drawer and I added an Echo Show to my dots and Echos. Today, my Echo Show prompted me that it could connect to my printer. I said yes and voila, I now can print on command. So, that’s my review. Alexa products are the best on the market in this category.

What we WANTED was to say to the show ""call [aunt]"" and for the device to call her show (so anyone there could pick up).  It doesn't work that way.Audio quality is ok, but not as good as the Alexa device which has amazing audio.Placing the Show in the same room as Alexa did work out for us.

I did a lot of research between the show 5, 8, and 10. I mostly chose the echo show 8 because the screen resolution is better and the sound is better than the 5. The show 10 was just too big for my needs in an office setting. Everyone at work loves it too. Voice recognition is very quick and responsive. Set up was super easy.

1792,Miguel Garces,Nice big screen,"  I got the Show 8 as an upgrade to my Show 5 in my kitchen.  The 8 inch screen is much easier to read from a distance.  The only complaint I have is that you can't use multi-room music while connected to Bluetooth speakers.  If you start multi-room music, the Bluetooth connection drops and the music plays from the internal speaker.  I contacted tech support and they confirmed that this is by design.

1793,TeresaB,Surprisingly? Fantastic!,"  I own just about every Amazon smart assistant device and speaker, but never delved into their screen-based products before. When you hear “Amazon” you don’t immediately think “Great screen devices.”When I first got the product it was a bit smaller than expected but then again, you can’t complain about the size too much given it is only $100. Set up took three minutes at most, very streamlined, and now I’m rocking and rolling!The main reason I purchased this was for the help in the kitchen. Admittedly, I thought I’d be able to pull up any recipe I wanted to and it would go through the steps. That’s not the case. Instead, you have to get a subscription to Food Network. The upside is Amazon is currently giving a free year’s subscription to the service for free, and then you are charged $40 a year afterwards. Could be worse.Otherwise? Pretty intuitive, the AI is excellent, and the speakers are way better than anticipated! Love love love this device!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2020"

I can even bring up recipes while I'm cooking and follow along.  Shoot, if the kids are obnoxious I can put on a video to keep them entertained while I cook.  All in all, 10/10 I'd buy it again.

Not happy about that, but it doesn't matter, because it wouldn't power on either. Called customer service and explained that it could be the cord (they only send a unit, and not a cord on the replacement).  After checking, they will not send a new cord, but could send a replacement unit (no cord). I said what good is sending another unit if the cord is defective?  Response, well then your only other option is refund. I really wanted to like it, and my wife was excited to use it, but the lack of effort and lack of common sense involved, I guess we will take our money back and spend it somewhere else.

It would also be a great improvement to have it set into a ""dock"" which is plugged into the wall. The 8 inch is definitely better than the 5 inch and worth the price difference.

It also starts sounding like a blown speaker when it turns off its screen (which can’t be controlled).

I say was as Amazon has done something to greatly lessen the value of this unit. Up until about a week ago Alexa would happily stream XM music all day long with no interruptions. Recently though the music will now abruptly stop after just 40 to 50 minutes without notice then dead silence. It happens on this device which I use at work and a similar device in my home so I know it is not my work environment causing this. All of my other devices connected to my home wi-fi act just fine so I know it is not the wi-fi signal. So it can only be Amazon's doing. This is a major flaw in a device that was purchased for just this function. The sound quality is just great but this new ""feature"" of the music abruptly cutting out is not.

And one morning it just didn't work anymore. I tried a couple of other models promising good sound quality, but in each case was dissatisfied with their display and controls. Almost our of desperation I tried the Echo Show 8 with Alexa. The sound quality is great, and once you get the hang of the voice commands it's easy to set. I wish it gave me more control the clock display, but that's a minor nit. I'm impressed by the number of radio stations (I'm an NPR geek, and all the stations I listen to I can get), and by the way it connects to my Spotify account.  Since it's internet and not over-the-air, the sound quality is fabulous. And Alexa works hard to do what I ask.

It angles up slightly so I either have to set it up lower than I want or move it to use it for video chats, my 2 and 4 year old grandkids have to stand on a chair and a stool to see.

1938,Dustin Campbell,Way better than Echo Show 5!!,"  The 5 was such a novelty and great as far as it goes, but the much larger screen size of the Show 8 is a real luxury.  Easy to see across the room.  I find the sound perfectly adequate and as a singer I am demanding. I have set my Show 8 onto a shelf of a large, enclosed bookcase, which seems to enhance the sound.

1939,Christina L Bennett,A little disappointed,"  I have several of these and basically love them.  However, I bought this particular one to integrate with my several ring cameras. That integration is one of the figures Amazon touts.  However, while it synchs well with the cameras, you can't have them all displayed at the same time, meaning you can only see one zone at a time and then only if you specifically request it.  On my iPhone, I see the view from all my cameras simultaneously.

Unfortunately, we've found the echo show to be severely lacking in functionality.- It plays pandora, but it can't play pandora in the background while you do something else- no integration at all with Gmail- When it goes into sleep mode, it closes all of your chrome tabs- You can't have more than one browser tab open at a timeLike yeah, it works, but its basically a dot with a screen for about 5x as much money.

I did want integration into some key smart home devices, primarily my Nanit baby cam and Blink security cameras. Alexa wouldn't find the Nanit initially, and the issue was on the Alexa side for sure - Amazon support was pretty terrible. I did figure it out on my own, and the Nanit Show skill is finally working so I can view my baby cam. Blink integrated smoothly in terms of discovery, but motion when detected doesn't route to Alexa automatically. You have to click into the camera each time, with a pretty long buffering period that sometimes fails. IFTTT integration is even worse, rather than closing the gaps.

One right after warranty ran out the 5 inch just died today (2 years after purchasing ).also ordered echo 4 ( 2020 )edition . Had to return both 8 inch show  and echo 4 for not being able to follow simple  commands and having to scream commands. Is  there a  ghost  in the Alexa  program? I think so. I had disconnected my 5 inch for awhile and after returning the other Ire-plugged that one and the same issue infected that one and then it  died. I was thinking about echo studio but don’t know now if I will. If I do  I  will pay for extended warranty. Which I hate to do. I enjoy having these around.

The voice recognition is horrible and not as intuitive as the simpler Echo devices.  You have to repeat things many times and a lot of the time the voice goes unrecognized.  We never had this happen with other Amazon devices.  The price was the enticer and a screen to watch recipes/movies while cooking.

Little did I know that they were sending a refurbished unit instead of a new one!  I called them about this and was told the refurbished unit was available and decided to send that one.

1995,DomG,Seamless replacement for older Echo Show,"  I was concerned about the chore of having to reconfigure all my connected devices, smart light bulbs, light strips plugs and thermostat.  That turned out to be a non-issue.  I unplugged the old Echo Show and then plugged in the new one, connected to my home network (wi-fi) then signed into my Amazon account.  Everything was there and working, even the apps on my iPhone that adjusted light colors and thermostat settings all worked.  No need to do anything... it was Great.  The new Show  looks much better and takes up less room on the counter and has a sleeker design and larger screen than my old one.  The picture quality is better (not vastly better - but noticeable) and the sound quality is much, much better.  Deeper and richer sounding than the old Show.  It's not on par with a Bose home theater system but, for a small counter top device, music has a very good, quality sound.  My old unit was a first gen Echo Show and that was a good device but this new one is far better all the way around.  I would highly recommend upgrading to this.  Also, I took advantage of Amazon's trade in and got a $30 credit plus a $25 gift card toward the purchase of the new device.  With $55 off you can't go wrong !  One last thought, I bought the stand for the new Echo Show separately, It's not really needed but it's nice to be able to adjust and tllt the unit to avoid screen glare.  It fits on the bottom of the unit perfectly and is magnetic so it stays in place.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2020"

Boy was I wrong about Alexa! She practically does all that and more than I realized. If that wasn't enough, I also got an Echo Dot, a Christmas gift from my daughter.

I figured “eh, let’s go for it”. I absolutely love it! I can say “”Alexa add milk to my shopping list” which she does and I can bring up on my phone when I go to the store, because like most people I make a list and then guess what.....leave it home. surprise! As far as the things to try....I think people are just looking for something to complain about. I absolutely LOVE it! Especially the recipes,  There was one called baked ziti, it was delicious, but HUGE I spent $40 on ingredients. Wasn’t as good reheated though.

We have an Echo Show 5 in the basement and when I want my husband to come upstairs instead of yelling to him I can ask the Echo Show 8 to tell him to come up for lunch or dinner.

I don’t like that they took off the day and date on the home screen. Need that especially early in the morning.

The captions work GREAT and for that, I'm happy.  However, when the captions are on, the video quality degrades significantly. Whatever processor is in there is not able to manage video, audio and captioning without losing effectiveness.  It's sufficient for our needs but a bit frustrating.

Then, after the family goes to bed, she goes on guard to ensure our (and hers) protection from violence, sudden illness, or serious pain.

We have other Echo devices, but since this one had a screen, I was constantly reminded that it is a billboard/marketing device. The straw that broke the camel’s back was that it was always suggesting that I get news from Al Jazeera. To put it very very nicely, I do not agree with Al Jazeera’s world view and do not want to get my news from them.I would press the ‘little three dots’ to bring up the menu to select “don’t suggest items like this” (or whatever the verbiage is), but guess what? The Echo device would suggest Al Jazeera after a week or so. After this didn’t work 3 or 4 or 5 or 10 times, I realized that this is no different than a billboard next to the freeway —I have no control or say as to what is shown to me. Why have the device then?

But found the Show to be more useful in my office. While typing it is easier to ask Alexa for answers rather than call up appropriate programs on the computer such as calculators and search engines.  I do not want a show in every room of the house, but still want one for the kitchen is in the future. My only negative is that it does not play Netflix.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2020"
2033,RDOFSB,"Stopped within 10 mins, broke my Echo 4th gen as well. Deadly for medically impaired","  I got the echo 4th gen a month ago so that I could do daily things that normal people do without complications, like turning on and off the lights. I thought that it worked really well and improved my life a lot, so I got the echo show 8 recently, as I moved and wanted to set up a camera at the front of the house.Within 10 mins of setting it up with the echo in my room, the screen changed colors and froze on this, giving this appearance. I tried to do the ""factory reset"", holding down the mute and volume down button for 15 seconds, only to see that the apple logo I was waiting for was also distorted as well. Since I de-registered it, there's no way of registering it anymore, other than that I bought it from amazon themselves just days ago.Whats worse is, my 4th gen echo is now permanently displaying a green ring. After just touching this echo show 8 for a few minutes and trying to set up speakers in 1 room, it's permanently damaged as well. It was a massive amount of money just for everything to break within seconds. The lights still turn on and off themselves, but this kind of malfunctioning is deadly. I just have asthma; Imagine an elderly person relies on this for their life, and it fizzles out with no way of repairing it.I don't know what to do other than return it at this point. My other echo device is permanently blinking green, with no hope of returning or refunding it.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2021"

2037,Rose B. ,Decent screen not many options no alexa app for show,  It's nice to have a screen to look at when u ask for weather and news but it doesn't work with alexa app so it's a lot harder to set up even tho u have a screen to look at during set up. And surprisingly the screen doesn't have many options to use with it mostly cameras everything u can do with an echo and TV. I'd of thought the screen would of had more options. It's nice but not what I expected. Guess it's cheaper than portal lol if u want to video chat with fam but it'd harder to use than an echo and does half the things echo does. Id say good for kitchen stuff over bedroom. It's nice to wake up to a clock and weather but I'm sure cheaper options for just that.

I  love that I can ask Alexa what time is the game on and she answers me, or tell Alexa to add an item to my shopping list as soon as I notice I am out of some item that is not a ""weekly buy"".  Setting alarms and playing music are easy as asking Alexa do it!  My Mom and brother also have this so now we can video chat and it is great.  I just need to get some smart plugs so I can control some light and such.

It’s like my Alexa thinks I’m speaking gibberish, repeatedly.I wish the Hulu function was better or maybe I’m not using it right. It’s pretty annoying how we try to use it now.I’d like to be able to save recipes I find, so I can access them faster, if that’s an option, I haven’t figured it out yet.Other than that, I’m happy with my purchase. I wouldn’t trade up or down.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2020"
2086,True-Reviews,Seriously no Netflix.,"  Purchased 2 of these devices and was beyond disappointed that they don't support hardly anything, including Netflix. I mean come on Amazon and it needs a search bar when searching for movies on Amazon. You have to call Alexa and say the name of the movie. Who makes a device without a search feature in their own movie store?!? This could have been a great device but they have obviously pushed this out without features that would really make this device stand out, no quality, just pushed out quantity.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2020"

You can stop this, you can customize what shows up, etc. I have helpful things like the weather or which of my teams won (or lost) rotate on my screen.The video is good and the sound quality is surprisingly awesome.My literal only complaint is that you can’t add apps.

I have a 8"" Echo Show sitting right on my home work desk, and it is a cool companion gadget. It keeps showing refreshing pictures ('nature' slide show that I set) interleaved with notifications on what all Alexa can do, current news, weather, songs, podcasts etc. When I notice something interesting, I touch the screen to go into the program, like to get detailed weather, songs or news. I have it linked to the Ring door bell and other blink cameras that work well with my Echo Show. I have a 5"" elsewhere in the house, but 8"" is way better than 5"" for just due to the bigger display. Excellent sound quality with nice base.One improvement is really required related to Ring integration. Echo is able to show Ring video if someone actually ringing the bell, however id dos not on motion detection.

It works with that too. People giving it 1 or 2 star reviews only because it has a Try Alexa message are being nit picky at best. You can make it so it only shows up on the home screen. People make it seem likes its always on display even while watching prime video or watching Ring Doorbell footage. It's not. It isn't a deal breaker for me and it shouldn't be for you either.

The alarm had never been set to go on at any time, and I went to the settings to confirm that. This, of course, is a deal breaker if it cannot be fixed.

2137,HX,the software on this is not great. It seems purposefully limited.,"  The issue that I have with the Echo Show isn't any of the individual features, which are great, but with the software itself.  There's simple things like not being able to set your home screen to show the date, the fact that as you're typing in information because Alexa misheard you, it will just go back to the home page deleting any changes you've made.  If Amazon would fix simple things like this it would be a great device. As for voice recognition, even when other devices are playing audio, it still picks up my voice which is great. I like the screen, and I like it when it goes into dark mode because it shows the time, day, and date (I wish I could have it do this during the day mode as well, but only works when room is dark...). so should you buy?

Echo Show 8 was all I need and more. It is the perfect size for my nightstand and very easy controls to understand. I gained more than a alarm clock, I got a personal assistant who can turn on and off my tv.

My Echo Show 8 and 10, both devices which we love stopped working all of a sudden.  I spent three hours with tech-support trying to troubleshoot the devices and was told that I would absolutely get a call back the next day with someone that could help me and that never happened.  Fast forward three months when I had time to try to call technical support at Amazon again and I spent another 3 1/2 hours on the phone and they could not get the devices to work.  Unbeknownst they then send me a new echo show 8 (which was great) to replace the old one but I didn’t get a shipping label to send back the old one and so they charged me for the second one.

We connected a few bluetooth devices and even the two Fire Sticks we had previously. There is some learning to do on both sides.

I'll update on this feature if/when we get the resolution/answer. Connecting/uploading your photos to Amazon photo allows the Show to play through slide-shows when you're not using it for other things. This will connect to Amazon Music, but we have yet to get iTunes connected. (Not sure if this is allowed on the Show.) Impressive how it learns. BE AWARE, the MyQ garage door opening system from Chamberlain requires you to pay them monthly to use their opener with ANY other smart-home device, app or service, such as IFTTT, Google home, Alexa, etc.., Terrible decision! steer clear of their device; there are many out now that will work with other bring your own device smart-home systems/standards.

2241,Ducky,"Great build, lacking features","  What really kills this is 2 things: No apps, and no One-command youtube lookup. Having to command alexa to open youtube, then have to  physically go to device, tap around and actually open a video is a complete defeat of purpose for some thing like this. also doesn't pick up voice as well as a 3rd gen echo it replaces, i didn't expect an upgrade in this aspect, but i certainly did not expect an downgrade, as it only picks up my voice 7/10 times i speak to it, where the 3rd gen echo dot was 9/10 . No apps for this also kills the need for having a screen, if all i can do i check my ring camera and see a weather forecast, i could save my money, do that on my phone, and just keep using the echo dot.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2020"

The Echo has become so ingrained in our house hold that our 2 1/2 y/o is telling Alexa to play music or turn on the TV.We’ve done quite a bit of home automation and being able to tell alexa to unlock doors, close the garage, turn off lights, etc. is super cool, but very convenient.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2020"

Have not been able to get them downloaded (have no idea why) I feel like an idiot talking to an inanimate object to play one song at a time. Quite often that little lady inside that box gets an attitude and plays something totally different. Voice recognition not bad but not so good either.  itunes and Apple in general are a royal pain in the ass and I was hoping this would be my saviour. Anyone who needs such an item to organize their lives using this item to make grocery lists, appointment reminders etc is a moron who might as well go ahead and just shoot themselves.

The echo show adds another layer of sophistication- a screen.  So when I’m cooking, I can view the recipe, and not worry about using my messy hands to scroll through the recipe- I just ask Alexa to scroll down or up, or move to the next step in the recipe.  The screen also works well with lists- if I add an item to my shopping list, it automatically pulls up the list, showing the new item as well as the existing items.  Asking for weather also pulls up a visual.  Originally the echo was around $300.  I recently got a deal that gave me an echo show and an echo dot for around $80.

The volume is turned up and sometimes there's very little nose in the background and I call her name very clearly but she'll act like she's deaf or doesn't feel like doing anything.  That's a bit worrisome considering what I paid for it. Not irritated enough to return because I don't give her very many commands and she answers more than she doesn't,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2021"
2361,Amazon Customer,Value isn't there for me.,  Spent a day using it and it's not worth the price. Screen only turns off when you ask Alexa and the screen temp were my biggest issue.

Try to open a browser to ore recipes? No music for you. And if you are playing to multiple units and open a browser on the show? You lose ALL music.I’ve had my gripes with other hardware/software disparities with amazon before. But this is crap.

2372,Sue Beebe,This is not a fire tablet.,"  IMO, Amazon is going backwards with user interfaces. The Fire HD Tablet had a decent interface, but they seem to screw something up each time they tweak it. The Echo Show user interface is horrible, and it doesn't play nice with the other devices, and they keep stepping on each other. It is common for me to ask the Show to do something, and I get a response from another room in my house. Alarms and other notifications interrupt movies or other things you're doing, and there is no obvious way to clear the screen that popped up to get back to what you were doing. The one good thing it has going for it is the sound.

I know putting one of these INSIDE the nursing home then was able to FaceTime INSIDE to facility to see Elderly grandparents and talk at same time. The voice was crisp n perfect for them to hear too. Also, the simplicity for kids and elderly or anyone not too tech savvy. I say every night  “ALEXA PLAY BEACH SOUNDS” and just like that I have my candles lit n it relaxes me and puts me right to sleep (I’m usually in deep with insomnia too) so, the daytime I tell “Alexa play my favorite music mix” and she plays any type of music, my photos with kids n grandkids etc all show up in a slide next to my bed.

I have turned off ""Skills"" in the home content and yet I still get ""Ask Alexa why is water wet?"" I'm never going to ask Alexa for crap like this. This ""feature"" is broken, you know it and even though all of your customers are complaining you refuse to turn it off in a software update. What do you hope to accomplish besides annoying your customers out of future purchases? I also have an Echo Show 5 on which I was able to get rid of 'try this"" but not on the 8. Fix it and I'll update my review. (Until then Gaffers Tape works...)Update: So the other day it was saying to ""Ask Alexa"" to call my deceased father... Thanks Amazon!  I had a chat with support in which they said ""it has already been escalated to be fixed in a future update"". They HAVE a switch (see pics) to turn it off that simply doesn't work on the Show 8, it does work on the Show 5. Turning on do not disturb works but makes the clock giant and breaks the photo stream from Albums you choose (just plays ALL photos on Amazon). None of the ""fixes"" others have listed turn it off. So if this is a deal breaker for you don't buy it. They know it's broken and I don't think they want to fix this ""feature"" that is only annoying their customers. Fix the switch, anybody who wants it can turn it on.Update 1/6/20 So 2 days ago the the mind numbing madness that is ""Tey Alexa"" was...Gone. They seemed to have heard our cries of pain folks (not sure what they did the OS hasn't been updated since November. Ponderous). I waited 2 days to update this so hopefully it's done.

We paid extra to get a stand and it works great with the additional stand, but for the price it should just have a stand already.Otherwise I love our echo show.

After researching this issue online and on forums, many other people have this problem and there is no fix. Amazon just tells you to update (already updated) and check internet and router settings... You can get the calls working again but you have to unplug and plug it back in again, which isn't easy if its located 3 hours away in another state.

No video plays after asking and am wondering if it's a device flaw as I have a fiber high speed connection so it's not that.

2454,Gitai Ben-Ammi,Fun addition to Alexa family!,"  ordered the show to use in kitchen, and set it up to always show time and temp, with rotating topics. I never use recipe books any more, use recipes on Pinterest on my iPad. The show will bring up recipes, but rarely one for what I want. If you DO find a recipe you like, you can save it. However, when you need it again, you will have to call up all recipes and go thru them.

I like to sometimes do things on my own. There's no way to put things on a home screen so that you can just get to the home screen and click on what you want to watch kind of like your fire TV or your computer or your phone which is kind of a bummer. I was kind of hoping for more from the echo show than what I got as far as that was concerned. However I do like the sound and the fact that I can get to calm.com in particular in order to get to my meditations, sleep music and stories, and other things I use my call map for.

2566,Janelle,Lil dumb computer with good speaker,"  It’s a little bit creepy. I got it as a gift and it is nice for playing music but it just creeps me out. There’s very little customization, And it rarely does what I want it to do. The standby screens are lame and I wish I could not have those. You can whisper “alexa” or something similar from the other room and it’ll start tuning in. Except for when I ask it to power itself off. It just ignores that. So I just yank the power cord when I’m done with it. Also if your watching a video or something and you pause it and go away it’ll go on standby and lose your place. Kind of annoying. But good for listening to music. It’s like a little dumb computer with a good speaker that tries to sell you things and show you news you don’t want to see.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2021"

It's my first Alexa device and she isn't as good as Siri in my opinion.  Lot's of requests are responded with ""I don't know about that"" or something similar.

Alexa does not understand the stop command on this device. The device frequently takes on a mind of its own which requires unplugging the device to make it stop. The sound quality is at best sub par.

I do enjoy the echo show 5 but this one is the echo show 8. These ""ads"" that I've read so many bad reviews and angry reviews about are not really ads, just like everything else it is giving recomendations, as you can see in the picture I sent both echo shows I have, have them at times of none use so just sitting there, but they don't pop up like ads for car dealers or like big sales going on. They are just recomendations. I don't mind them, she doesn't say them to you, they just show up when you aren't doing anything or talking to her.

2921,William N.,What was Amazon thinking?,  I bought the show 8 because I have a show that I love. I really enjoy having the larger screen and the show 8 has much better sound. During the initial setup I was very disappointed when I realized that the show 8 dose not allow you to have a customizable clock screen. Why would Amazon not carryover this great feature from the show 5. I considered sending the show 8 back because of this shortcoming.

It sits on its stand on the kitchen counter and lets me select and follow recipes, enjoy music, watch news clips, and will respond to any off-the-wall question.

Well, the clock function at night is tiny, taking up 1/4 of the screen.  I can't see that.  And there's not settings similar to the echo show 5 to change it.  So disappointed.

Alexa in the kitchen already that acts as the home intercom system to have to constantly switch between the two. But I digress. The Show itself is super good. Really intuitive and easy to set up.

If you try to use the touch screen to reach a network, you'll find only the first 14 Hulu networks displayed.  Amazon helps solution, ""Unplug your device for 30 seconds and restart,"" did not work.

I tried to load pictures which is one of the main reasons I purchased it. I went through all of the info on line & was so excited when I got to the last step. Then whoosh I get the voice telling me this device doesn't have that feature. Not happy at all. If I can't get pictures loaded then this will be mailed back before my deadline.  Not happy at all. Very upset with the entire device. I know some people love they can look on line for everything however I am not one of those people.

3352,Drea,Waste of money if you intend to integrate Echo Buds,"  Very, very deceptive, Amazon.  Too bad, as I just got off the chat with an Amazon rep.  You CANNOT pair Amazon’s own Echo Buds with this device!  The rep told me I needed to buy a Non-Amazon set of Bluetooth earbuds in order to pair with the Show 8.  Even though in the Alexa app, it states that the Buds are a wireless option.  AND, the Alexa app designates the Echo Buds as a “gadget” to work with the Echo Show.  But they WILL NOT PAIR.  And the Amazon rep confirmed that.  Literally told me to buy a non-Alexa requiring set of Bluetooth earbuds not made by Amazon.  Not cool, and a horrible design flaw in the Show 8.  Bad move, Amazon.  Buyer beware.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2020"
3353,Marguerite,So far love it and I'm getting another one for down stairs.,  The speaker is so nice and loud. I love the display of being able to drop in on my cameras from an app I already had.

3355,Marcus Stewart,Can't figure out how to keep the pictures from turning off,"  It's a great, useful item. My Mum has one and I have the other, it helps her connect to us quickly but the screen shuts off and then Alexa takes a little to hear a command.

Today I spoke with Rohan and he told me not to return the item but donate it or whatever.

I was running my music through a different device but the Echo Show 8 will now be my default player. I was contemplating getting the 5” screen but held out for the 8” and I’m very happy I waited for this to be released. The screen size is perfect, not to big and not to small.

3369,Heather Souza ,Totally Awesome,"  I have been a long time Google Hub fan, that was until I got the Alexa Show, it is so much easier to setup devices than the Hub is and it seems like more devices are compatible with Show verses Hub. I love this thing!! My Ring doorbell cam would not work on the Hub, but works fine on Show, and to be fair maybe I screwed up when hooking to Hub, which just goes to prove my point that devices are easier to setup on the Show.

3370,Abby D.,The bass makes the unit move on granite counter tops,"  After easily installing the beautiful device I told Alexa to play Sade... the bass was enough to make the unit move. The device began to move in a clockwise motion. I turned the bass all the way down, but it still moved when the volume was turned up. It appears that it may dance it self off the counter.

It automatically recognized my existing Echo Dot which made the integration simple.I love the call feature and have encouraged my friends to purchase ne so we can video chat hands free. While speaking on it I'm told the sound is very clear. My favorite feature, so far, is the speaker volume when listening to my music. Oh and did I mention the screen clarity ...

3373,Jonathan J. Fattu,It is pretty OK,"  I did not have high expectations since I already had Echo devices around the house.  I was kind of disappointed that the Echo Show would ""accidentally"" get in ""shopping mode"" and only show me items to buy thereafter.  Also, the results for videos are hot and miss.  They should really just market this as a Fire TV in an 8-inch format.  it would be more useful for my family's use case.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2020"

I replaced an older model because my husband and I used it a LOT and figured that the newer version would be a treat.

I am disappointed that you can not run a separate visual and audio. For instance, run audible and have the fireplace on visually. I would think that would be part of the perks of having the  show.

However, if you plan to use this product on a regular basis for listening to music you will likely become frustrated, especially if you prefer linking to Apple Music. Linking is simple but, quite often the streaming cuts out in the middle of songs or playlists. Alexa says ""there is a problem...unable to find music"". Repeated attempts to reboot or re-state the command are unsuccessful. After some time passes (anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour) the problem will resolve itself about the time you're ready to just give up and listen to music on a different device.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2020"

All in all it is faster and more responsive, however I have to wear glasses so I was hoping the night mode from the show 5 would be the same, but bigger. Instead of red numbers illuminating the whole screen, there are only white numbers in the bottom corner.

If you ask it not to play Christmas music right now or in February, she plays a Christmas playlist.  Doesn't understand hardly any rural words and is geared toward young people and city life.

Seeing the lyrics to songs was nifty, but not necessarily ground breaking.  There is no way to get apps, it only has ""skills"" which were mildly fun in the beginning but the novelty wore off quickly.  A constant barrage of random news sites rotates through the headlines... showing all the doom and gloom happening in the world.  I don't need to see that on my kitchen counter.

The Echo Show is great for being productive and all, but it’s also great to have when you’re lounging around and want to listen to music.

3611,MissApril,Features,"  I have both the Echo 8 and the Echo 5. For me the Echo 5 has better functionality/Customization over the 8. Such as, on my 5 I can change the clock font but I can't on the 8? The 5 and 8 do not have the same menu configuration, why? If they give the 8 what the 5 has for features this rating would go up. Voice recognition and command functionality are not perfect but I also understand this is a fairly young technology. I want the understanding of the system to increase so it can better it's ability to fulfill requests. Such as 'Alexa, randomize my thumbs up list on pandora.' This is something it can not due right now. The Echo products do not let you use a full app. It's more like a super simple version of an app. So again I don't like the functionality limitations and hope they change this soon.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2020"
3612,Jaime Davila,Bought for Aging Aunt,"  This was great for an aging aunt who cannot pick up the phone. I set up ""Drop In"" so that her loved ones could just drop in to see if she is at her table. A few relatives use their own Shows and a few relatives just drop in from the Alexa app on their phones. There was a lot of trial and error to set up everyone but it is working great. Hint: If the user doesn't have a mobile phone number it makes it harder but there are free ways of getting a phone number to connect to the account like TextNow.

3807,Sharon L Burrell,Bad choice,"  Got this device after been using echo dots for a while, but is far from being as good as dot’s are. Voice recog really sucks, you need to literally shout just in front of it to make it recognize a command (it’s placed on a table with recomended clearance so it’s not an installation issue). If you’re lucky and it gets your command, will probably get it wrong and you’ll have to repeat it several times which is even more frustrating. Overall is just a nice smart picture frame do not expect too much other than displaying photos.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2020"

Ok why does the ""Echo Show 8"", with video capabilities,not allow you to read your own purchased kindle books. I know the device reads your books to  you.

3831,anonymous,Full clock not available,"  One of the things I love about the Echo Show 5 is the ability to display a full clock.  This is not an option with Show 8.  In order to continually display the clock, you need to set up the Do Not Disturb, which will show the clock and turn off the Things to Try.  When playing prime video's, the picture is clear and the sound is good.  Overall, if I had purchased the Echo 8 first instead of the Echo 5, the shortcomings wouldn't have been as obvious.

With the Echo show it shows you the word, pictures and data you can see on the screen.  100 times better.  There are a lot of things I have not tried yet, so I feel like it will only get better for us.  My wife has no way of seeing who is outside with our Ring doorbell and other Ring cameras.

But when alexa starts talking or ur listening to music you start to hear the speaker really raspy and thats on half the full volume. The hulu app: it doesn't let you pick from ur own profile and doesn't let you pick episodes. It helps to tell alexa “play so and so season 2 episode 3”. Not to many  video apps.

When someone rings our doorbell it lets me know that someone is at my door and also pulls up the image from the doorbell so I can see who it is prior to going to the door. I also love the fact that it’s voice recognition and can have the entire family connected to it. I also use it for recipes while I am cooking. I normally would pull up my phone and have the recipe pulled up but once my phone would lock I would have to unlock it with dirty hands and find my place but not with this!

The Results were close but for the money the show 8 was recommended.But finding the skills and getting them to work seems to be problematic. For example, I found a skill that reads stories for kids. It shows multiple stories but when I ask it to read a story we get the same story every time. When I ask for kids songs one time I get a great selection the next time it’s the same 6 songs over and over. I wanted to set up skills but I am having difficulty finding the skills to enable them.

Its primary use is as a bedside clock with a secondary purpose of  monitoring the Ring doorbell.

One thing I don't like is it is difficult to hold a recipe on the screen while I'm working on it.  There may be an easy command for that but I haven't found it.My biggest complaint against Alexa is that there is no way to change the default search engine.

Alexa almost never is able to search or play something you ask for. To get something to work the ""phrase"" has to be exact.

You can link your Hulu account. But if you try the NBC skill or any other skill that you have to link your DirecTV account, it will take you through the paces and then give you an error after you try like ""HTTP method GET is not supported on this URL.""
